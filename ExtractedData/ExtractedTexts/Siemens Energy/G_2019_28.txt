1.2.1.2 majorshareholders
as of the date of the prospectus, all of the existing shares, currently representing all of the shares in the
company,arehelddirectlyorindirectlybysiemensag,sothatthecompanyiscontrolledbysiemensag.
following spin-off completion, siemens ag and siemens pension-trust e.v. will initially hold 35.1% and
9.9%, respectively, of the shares, representing the existing shares. the new shares, which will then
represent 55% of the shares, will be transferred to the shareholders of siemens ag. the number of new
sharesattributabletoeachshareholderofsiemensagdependsonthepercentageofsharesinsiemensag
heldbysuchshareholderimmediatelypriortospin-offcompletion.
inordertopreventsiemensagfromcontrollingthecompanyafterspin-offcompletion,thecompanyand
siemens ag entered into a deconsolidation agreement (entherrschungsvertrag) which, inter alia, restricts
the exercise of the voting rights attached to the existing shares. under the deconsolidation agreement,
siemens undertakes vis-à-vis the company that, among other things, there will be a maximum of three
shareholders’ representatives in the company’s supervisory board who are dependent on siemens, e.g.,
membersoftheexecutiveboard(vorstand)ofsiemensag.forpurposesofthedeconsolidationagreement,
membership in the supervisory board of siemens ag alone does not result in that person being dependent
onsiemens.accordingly,unionrepresentativeswhoaremembersofboththesupervisoryboardofsiemens
ag and the supervisory board of the company are deemed to be independent of siemens under the
deconsolidation agreement, although their dual mandates may result in conflicts of interest (see
“1.4.3.3materialconflictsofinterestpertainingtothelisting”).
1.2.1.3 executiveboard
the company’s executive board (vorstand) has four members. dr.-ing. christian bruch acts as the chief
executive officer (ceo, vorstandsvorsitzender) of the company. ms. maria ferraro acts as chief financial

interim financial statements of siemens energy as of and for the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020
were prepared in accordance with ifrs on interim financial reporting (ias 34) (the “unaudited condensed

renewableenergy:
(cid:129) gas and power – unser gas and power segment bietet eine große bandbreite an produkten, lösungen
und dienstleistungen auf den gebieten der energieübertragung und der konventionellen zentralen und
dezentralen energieerzeugung neben industriellen anwendungen für die öl- und gasindustrie sowiefür
industrielleprozessanwendungen.darüberhinausentwickeltundvermarktetdasgasandpowersegment

€ 589 mio. im zum 30. september 2019 endenden geschäftsjahr und € (539) mio. im zum 30. juni 2020
endenden neunmonatszeitraum. die geschäftstätigkeiten des gas and power segments sind in drei
divisionen aufgeteilt: transmission, generation und industrial applications, die durch unsere other
operationskomplementiertwerden.
- transmission – unsere division transmission bietet ein breites portfolio von produkten, systemen,
lösungen und dienstleistungen an, die auf die wichtigsten markttrends digitalisierung,
dekarbonisierung, netzstabilität und elektrifizierung ausgerichtet sind. das produktportfolio umfasst
luft-undgasisolierteschaltanlagen,transformatoren,digitalisierteprodukteundandereproduktewie

- other operations – unsere other operations beinhalten unser new energy business und bestimmte
at-equity-beteiligungen. unser new energy business komplementiert unser portfolio indem es neue
technologien im bereich der dekarbonisierten energiesysteme entwickelt. der schwerpunkt des new
energy business ist es, die grüne wasserstoffwirtschaft zu ermöglichen und die dekarbonisierung
voranzutreiben, z.b. durch die entwicklung von “power-to-x”-technologien, die strom aus
erneuerbaren energien für die produktion co2-armer synthetischer energiequellen (kraftstoffe)
nutzen.
(cid:129) siemens gamesa renewable energy – unser sgre segment konzentriert sich auf die förderung, das
design, die entwicklung, die herstellung und die lieferung von produkten, anlagen und technologisch
fortgeschrittenen dienstleistungen im bereich der erneuerbaren energien mit schwerpunkt auf
windparks und erbringt auch dienstleistungen einschließlich management, betrieb und wartung. sgre
prüft auch möglichkeiten in angrenzenden geschäftsfeldern der erneuerbaren energien, die in vielen
fällen ebenfalls mit dem windturbinengeschäft verbunden sind. diese aktivita¨ten machen jedoch nur
einen kleinen bruchteil der gegenwa¨rtigen gescha¨ftsta¨tigkeit der sgre aus. das sgre segment
erwirtschaftete gesamtumsatzerlöse von € 10.227 mio. im zum 30. september 2019 endenden

3 risk factors
in considering whether to invest in the shares (the “shares”) of siemens energy ag (hereinafter
also the “company”), investors should consider carefully the following risks, in addition to the
other information in this prospectus (the “prospectus”). in this prospectus, references to the
“siemens energy group”, the “group”, “siemens energy”, “we”, “us” or “our” are references
tothecombinedgroupofentitiesandbusinessactivitiescomprisingthesiemensenergybusiness,
with the company acting as the ultimate holding company as from the completion of the
spin-off for absorption (abspaltung zur aufnahme) under the german transformation act
(umwandlungsgesetz) (the “spin-off”, and its completion, the “spin-off completion”). the risk
factors featured in the prospectus are limited to risks which are specific to siemens energy or the
shares in the company and which are material for taking an informed investment decision. the
materiality of the risk factors has been assessed based on the probability of their occurrence and
the expected magnitude of their negative impact. the risk factors are presented in categories
depending on their nature. in each category the two most material risk factors are mentioned
first according to the assessment based on the probability of their occurrence and the expected
magnitude of their negative impact. the risks mentioned may materialize individually or
cumulatively.
3.1 risks related to our industry
3.1.1 the energy market is subject to disruptive developments, such as the trend towards
decarbonization, and we may be too slow or even fail in adapting our business
modelandproductportfolio.
the products, solutions and services offered by our gas and power segment’s generation and
industrial applications divisions serve, to a significant extent, conventional power generation
usingfossil fuelssuchasoil,gasandcoal.fossilpowergenerationiscurrentlyunderpressuredue
to the prevailing trend towards more sustainable power generation using renewable energy
sources (also referred to as “renewables”) or carbon-neutral fuels. to a certain extent, this holds
also true for nuclear power generation. this trend is impacted by several factors beyond our
control, in particular by government intervention, public and private initiatives, the efficiency
and cost of renewable energy technologies, as well as selectiveness of and restrictions for
investors and lenders and changing consumer preferences in energy consumption. most of these
interventions and initiatives are directed to limit global climate change. the transition pathways
towardsmoresustainablepowergenerationcanvarybycountryorregion.
thereis arisk thatthedemandfor fossil powerplantsandrelatedinfrastructure includinghighly
efficient gas turbines will be lower than we expect due to a faster than expected transition
towards renewables. in other words, there is a risk that accelerated growth in new installations
ofsolar andwind powerduetotheirdeclininglevelizedcostofenergycouldresultindecreasing
demandforconventionalpowergenerationinsomeregionsoftheworld.suchtransitionmaybe
drivenby,amongothers,regulation,marketdesignfavoringrenewablepowergenerationorless
policies aimed at supporting investments into new firm power generation capacities based on
fossil or carbon-neutral fuel. also, a faster than expected development of competitive energy
storage solutions could accelerate the change towards renewables by offsetting their
disadvantage of not being able to respond flexibly to varying energy demands. decarbonization
requirements might result in increased costs for the oil & gas industry, limited access tofinancing
and could have an adverse impact on the overall demand for oil and natural gas. as a result, this
may translate into lower investment volumes, in particular for oil & gas greenfield projects,
thereby negatively affecting our industrial applications business. in addition, the trend towards
decarbonization might force us to review our strategy, our organizational set-up, our portfolio
andfootprint.
if these developments result in fewer orders for new power plants, oil & gas products or
solutions, or other industrial applications, our service business might be affected insofar as there
16
are fewer opportunities to conclude new service contracts related to orders for new power
plants, equipment and solutions. our service backlog may be affected if customers decide to
decommission conventional power plants, other assets or to cancel or postpone modernizations.
our maintenance service business may be affected through a reduced number of full-load hours
of the conventional power plants or installed oil & gas assets due to less dispatch and our
customers could seek to renegotiate their long-term service contracts, which may result in less
volumeorlessfavorableconditionsforus.
in addition, within renewables, we are offering wind power applications through our sgre
segment (which comprises siemens gamesa renewable energy s.a., zamudio, spain, (“sgre
s.a.”) and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (“sgre”)) but we have only limited products and
services related to solar power generation or other renewable technologies in our portfolio. if
the solar market or other renewable fields develop more dynamically than expected this may
have a material adverse effect on our business (see”3.1.8 the wind power industry faces
structural market changes, in particular declining subsidy levels, and there can be no guarantee
that siemens gamesa renewable energy will succeed in addressing the resulting challenges.”).
alsointhiscase,fewerorderscouldaffectourservicebusiness.
similarly, we are offering only limited products and services for nuclear power applications.
should this market develop more dynamically than expected, we may miss business
opportunities.
furthermore, we are offering our customers various pathways to transform their existing fleet of
fossil fuel-based power generation technology into a less carbon-intensive one. depending on
governmentalpolicysupportandregulatoryimplementation,suchmarketsmaypickupearlieror
later than expected. in addition, the trend towards decentralization may adversely impact
markets for centralized power generation, including gas power plants and related power grids,
e.g., high-voltage substations. if we are too slow or if we fail to adapt our business model and
our product portfolio to specific regional demand in time or at all, this may have a material
adverseeffectonourbusiness,financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
3.1.2 we may fail to comply with environmental, social and governance (esg) standards
and expectations which could adversely impact our business and reputation. at the
same time, compliance with certain esg standards may pose additional challenges to
ourbusiness.
we must increasingly meet environmental, social and governance (“esg”) standards and
expectations regarding environmental concerns (e.g., climate change and sustainability), social
concerns (e.g., diversity and human rights), and corporate governance concerns (e.g., employee
relations when making business and investment decisions). we may not always be able to
identify and adequately assess the relevant concerns, which may result in failure to meet esg
standards and expectations of stakeholders or the public, which could adversely impact our
reputation.atthesametime,compliancewithcertainesgstandards,inparticularenvironmental
standards,mayposechallengestoourbusinessandleadtoadditionalcostsinourbusiness.
in the wider context of esg, there is a risk of insufficient funding or procurement of other
financing instruments and other financial services such as financing, securities, hedging
instruments or insurance provided by banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions
for specific projects or our whole business operations due to financial institutions’ internal,
industry-wide or policy-driven prerequisites for all dimensions of esg. examples are the new
‘lending criteria’ of the european investment bank (“eib”) or the european union’s (the “eu”)
taxonomy for sustainable activities (see “3.3.4 our business and the businesses of our customers
and suppliers require access to significant credit and guarantee lines and other financing
instruments. our business activities could be negatively affected if we are unable to meet our
capital requirements in the future, for example in weak financial market environments, as a
result of a significant deterioration of our credit standing or of a breach of a credit facility
agreement, or if access to capital becomes more expensive. our business activities could be
17
similarly negatively affected if our customers or suppliers do not have access to financing on
economicallyviableterms.”below).
ourabilitytorealizeprojectsintheenergyindustry,whetherconventionalorrenewable,maybe
negatively impacted by esg standards. for example, we may be contributing technology for new
coal-fired power plants in indonesia and we have been and may continue to be confronted with
protestsagainstourparticipationincoal,oilandgas,nuclearorrenewableprojectsfromclimate,
environmental or other civil groups which, in particular if such protests receive extensive media
coverage, could have an impact on the willingness of important stakeholders to contribute or
support such projects, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position,reputationandresultsofoperations.
3.1.3 our industries and business operations are subject to various risks relating to global
or local outbreaks of infectious diseases and other public health crises. in particular,
weareaffectedfromthefalloutoftheoutbreakoftherecentcoronaviruspandemic.
we are a globally active group and, as such, directly and, through our customers and suppliers,
indirectly exposed to various risks arising out of or in relation to global and local spreads of
infectious diseases, such as the recent outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic (“covid-19”), or
other forms of public health crises. risks stem not only from the immediate effect of such crises
but also from any measures aimed at limiting their impact, including, but not limited to,
restrictions on travel, imposition of quarantines, prolonged closures of workplaces, curfews or
other social distancing measures, including the social impact of such measures. such measures
may be required by public health laws, imposed by public authorities on international, national
or local level, required under best practices in our industries or implemented under our own or
our customers’ or suppliers’ environmental, health and safety (“ehs”) standards. covid-19 has
already resulted in lockdowns and various levels of restrictions of movement being imposed
globally, including china, germany, italy, france, the united states of america (“united states”
or “u.s.”) and other countries where we sell our products, system solutions and services. the
restrictions include curtailing travel, closure of schools, prohibitions of mass gatherings and
mandatory remote working. the extent to which global and local economies, the industries in
which we are active in, our business operations and the business operation of our customers are
affected by public health crises depends on a number of factors. these factors include, but are
not limited to, the spread of diseases and the duration of outbreaks, timing, adequacy and
effectiveness of countermeasures imposed by public health laws or public authorities at
international, national or local level and the level of civil compliance with such measures. there
can be no guarantee that such measures, or a combination thereof, are effective means to
combat such an outbreak and the implications resulting therefrom. a continuing public health
crisis due to the inefficiency of relevant measures as well as the effects of the countermeasures
themselves may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position and results of
operations.
inparticular,wearesubjecttothefollowingrisksrelatingtosuchcrises:
(cid:129) the spread of infectious diseases among our workforce may adversely interrupt, and even
result in a shutdown of our production, our project sites, internal functions, and service and
salesactivities, particularlyinthecaseofahighsicknessrateorquarantines,whichhasresulted
and could result in a loss of productivity. social distancing according to public health laws or
our ehs standards in factories, offices and sites has already led and may lead to inefficiencies
or cost increases. under such laws and standards, we may be required to temporarily suspend
our activities, in particular the execution of our projects, which could materially adversely
affect our internal processes and supply chains. on risks relating to ehs standards, see also
“3.4.6 we are subject to environmental, health and safety as well as other regulatory
requirements and risks, as a result of which we may incur significant costs, liabilities and
obligations.”;
(cid:129) similar risks affecting key suppliers and restrictions to the free transfer of goods and supplies
on which we depend have already led and may lead to supply chain disruptions and result in

ustoclaimsofnon-performanceordamages;
(cid:129) in addition to these risks, the imposition of travel restrictions may also adversely affect our
businesses, especially because we run global operations. for example, our service and project
businesses rely on our and our project partners’ and contractors’ ability to send personnel
on-site and to provide installation and service capacities, the lack of which could result, e.g., in
service outages. the impact of public health crises and countermeasures in connection with
covid-19 have already had and may continue to have detrimental effects on the execution of
our projects (see also “3.2.6 our project business is subject to several risks, including execution
risks, cost overruns, quality and political risks.”) and may also cause our customers to defer
investments or payments, which may lead to a lower order intake and deferred or lower

(cid:129) certain global and national initiatives and governments have called for post-covid-19 stimulus
packagestocombatimpendingrecessionwithafocusonacceleratingtheshifttowardsamore
sustainable energy production through directed investments. if such stimulus packages were
adopted, this could impair the prospects of industries such as the oil & gas industry and,
consequently, adversely affect demand for certain offerings of our gas and power segment
(see also “3.1.1 the energy market is subject to disruptive developments, such as the trend
towards decarbonization, and we may be too slow or even fail in adapting our business model
andproductportfolio.”);
(cid:129) the fallout from covid-19 may lead to a tougher business environment and has prompted
corporations to draw-down liquidity from banks and issue financing requests, resulting in
substantial strain on banks’ balance sheets and regulatory indicators and metrics. in addition,
capital markets financing and other funding sources have become highly volatile and
expensive. such effects could increase financing costs and re-financing risks for us, our
customers and suppliers and may result in customers deferring or canceling planned
investments, leading to less demand for our offering, or could also lead to requests for the
renegotiation of contracts or for deferrals of payments by our customers. our customers or
suppliers may also face financial difficulties or even insolvencies and banks themselves may
face liquidity and refinancing challenges that could result in limited access to or increasing
costs toobtainfinancing products andotherfinancial services (see also “3.3.4 our businessand

are unable to meet our capital requirements in the future, for example in weak financial

global or local spreads of infectious diseases and measures aimed at limiting their impact could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and
such effects would be greater if various risks, including potential quarantines, suspensions of

3.1.4 competition and lower market prices could negatively affect our business, financial
positionandresultsofoperations.
the worldwide markets for our products, solutions and services are highly competitive. factors
such as pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time,
customer relationships, financing terms and the ability to quickly adapt to shifts in market
demands play an important role in our highly competitive market environments. for example,
more recently, governments in some of our sgre segment’s key markets are moving away from
fixed support regimes for renewable energy generation towards market-based auction models
where a number of competing developers are submitting bids for projects, with awards being
made based on the lowest entry price and the lowest level of incentives required for the project.
we face strong established competitors and rising competitors from emerging markets, where
many competitors have developed their offerings locally and are now expanding globally, and
competitors from new industries such as digital industries, which may offer more advanced
products or solutions or have a better cost structure. some industry fields in which we operate
are undergoing consolidation, which may result in stronger competitors or a change in our
relative market position. decreasing demand for our offerings as a result of a weaker market
position couldleadtoincreases in inventory offinishedorwork-in-progress goodsorunexpected
priceerosion.
globally, contractors, which offer turnkey power plant solutions using components from
different suppliers to optimize costs, contribute to price decreases. similarly, customers who are
facing increasingly fierce competition (e.g., from the renewable energy industry or new price
determination processes such as auctions) often pass on the price pressure to their original
equipment manufacturer (“oem”) suppliers such as the group. reduced demand for our
products might also lead to additional overcapacities of oem suppliers putting additional
pressure on profitability. in our service business, we face competition from major established
players and non-oem suppliers targeting, in particular, our turbine service business, which is a
major source of profitable revenue. this risk is further exacerbated by the fact that we grant the
non-exclusive right to certain companies to manufacture, sell and service certain of our products
in specific territories, or to use certain of our intellectual property or design tools to develop
theirownproduct.theseagreementsarebasedontheassumptionthatitisbeneficialtousifwe
are active in these markets via a partner. should we subsequently decide to directly serve the
respective market, we may be forced to compete with our partner. in our transmission division,
emergingasiancompetitorsposethegreatestchallengesastheycontinuouslyenternewmarkets
and increase their competitiveness through market consolidation. our sgre segment may in the
future face additional competition from chinese manufacturers that may decide to enter global
wind turbine markets, which may result in price decreases and a loss of market share for our
sgresegment.
some of these developments may prompt us to revise our strategy and product portfolio and
there can be no assurance that such revisions yield the targeted results. if the group is unable to
compete effectively against its competitors or achieve satisfactory prices in negotiations with
customers,thiscouldhaveamaterialadverseeffectonourbusiness,financialpositionandresults
ofoperations.
3.1.5 adverse changes of certain external economic factors may negatively affect our
business,financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
if the macroeconomic conditions of the economies in which we operate deteriorate, our business
may be negatively affected. for example, an actual or expected deterioration of macroeconomic
conditions could lead to our customers modifying, delaying or canceling plans to purchase our
products, solutions and services, or they may fail to follow through on purchases or contracts
already executed. for the same reasons, the prices that are achievable for our products, solutions
and services may decline to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. in addition, it may
become more difficult for our customers to obtain financing, including project financing and
securities. furthermore, we are active in oil & gas projects, grid-related projects and power
generation projects, including wind power projects. the projects business typically requires
substantial investments, for which our customers generally need to obtain financing, including
20
project financing, securities or other financing. our customers’ financing may also involve
external financing from international investors and lenders as well as the availability of export
credit agencies’ (“ecas”) support. the availability and terms of financing for our customers,
including in particular, interest rates for such financing have already partially deteriorated in
light of the covid-19 outbreak and may continue to do so. the availability of credit support by
ecas generally has a significant influence on whether and when customers and their lending
banks will proceed with the development of such projects and thus utilizing our products,
solutions and services. in particular, large projects may become increasingly difficult to finance
and subject to stricter requirements. in addition, customers could request to move agreed
payment dates, which could negatively impact our financial position. additionally, customers
may increasingly request more business models focusing on operational expenditure where we
receive payments distributed over a timeframe of several years while the majority of our cost
ariseupfront,whichwouldaddstraintoourbalancesheet.
if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate, including an adverse development of financing
conditions and reduced credit support for our customers, we could face reduced demand for our
offering, which could in particular affect our project business and have a material adverse effect
onourbusiness,financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
3.1.6 political instability, international conflicts or new trade barriers may have a negative
effectonourbusiness,financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
our business prospects and the execution of projects awarded to us may be negatively affected
by political instability or international conflicts. for example, we may be forced to reorganize,
reduce or terminate business operations in geographical areas where our employees, partners or
subcontractors would otherwise be subject to unacceptable economic or personal risks, e.g., due
to ongoing or threatened civil unrest, terror attacks or war. some of our current and planned
projects and service activities are in regions, which are exposed to a higher risk in this respect,
e.g., in libya, iraq and other countries. furthermore, our business prospects or the execution of
our order backlog may be negatively affected by changes in the political and economic
framework,e.g.,duetotradewars,punitivetariffs,sanctions,protectionistmeasures,boycottsor
economicweaknessofeconomiesorindustries.
in 2018, siemens signed the memorandum of understanding with the ministry of electricity in
iraq to implement the five-year “iraq roadmap”, including the expansion of transmission and
distribution networks. in 2019, we signed an implementation agreement with the iraqi
government to start the execution of this roadmap. the first phase of the roadmap includes
contracts valued around € 700 million. project execution, and thus recognition of any revenues
from this project, is still subject to a number of conditions precedent. factors which may result in
nonfulfillment of these conditions precedent include government intervention, terrorist activity,
violent conflicts, regional instability, including armed conflicts between iran and the united
states and increasing tensions between iraq and the united states. for example, on january 5,
2020, the president of the united states threatened to impose sanctions on iraq if the iraqi
government forces u.s. troops to withdraw from the country on unfriendly terms. if the u.s.
administration pursues such action it is unclear at this time what specific measures, if any, might
be adopted or implemented. since 2018, the united states have granted a series of waivers to
iraq to continue purchasing electricity and natural gas from iran. if the u.s. administration
decides to not renew these waivers or imposes some form of sanctions or other restrictive
measures concerning iraq, or if regional instability and violent conflicts in the region escalate, it
could have negative implications for our local business and prevent us from executing our
contractsiniraqwhichcouldhaveamaterialadverseeffectonourresultsofoperations.
our inability to perform our contractual obligations may subject us to claims for
non-performance or damages. we may not be able to exploit new business opportunities, which
may result in the loss of revenue. furthermore, a cessation or reduction of our business may

21
as we are a globally operating group, the imposition of new barriers to free trade would
negatively impact production costs and productivity along our value chains. in addition, new
barriers to trade may reduce the level of investment activity and cause supply chain disruptions
(see also “3.2.4 we are dependenton the availability of certain materials, parts andcomponents,
andanydisruptionsinthesupplychainmayresultinadditionalcostsorlossofrevenues.”),which
couldseverelyaffectourbusiness.webelieveakeyriskinthisregardisthesimmeringu.s.-china
trade conflict which may escalate into a global trade war. in the u.s.-china trade conflict, each
country has recently imposed tariffs on the other country’s products. as we have significant
business in the u.s. and in china, we are exposed to potential new trade barriers which may
impede our business with china and the u.s. also, our operations outside china and the u.s.
could be affected due to potential supply chain disruptions as a consequence of such a trade
conflict. in particular, several components for our sgre segment’s products are manufactured in
china and the u.s.-china trade conflict may have a negative impact on our sgre segment’s
business including interruptions of its product manufacturing processes, delays in delivering its
products, claims for damages and our sgre segment may not be able to replace its chinese
suppliers in time or at economically reasonable costs. our sgre segment may also find it
increasingly difficult to sell its products that are subject to additional tariffs in the chinese
market at a competitive price or at all. furthermore, the consequences of the united kingdom
(“uk”) withdrawing from the eu (so-called “brexit”) remain unclear. although the uk ceased to
be an eu member on january 31, 2020, the trading relationship is expected to remain the same
until december 31, 2020. negotiations determining the conditions of the future trading
relationship between the eu and the uk are currently ongoing. if the eu and the uk fail to
conclude a trading framework which provides for trading terms substantially similar to the
currentterms,thismaymateriallyadverselyaffectourbusinessoperationsandresults.
the realization of any significant adverse political developments, in particular with regard to
continued sanctions relief for iraq and trade relationships between economic powers, could have

3.1.7 some of our customers may be affected by long-term low oil prices or long-term low
demand for oil and gas which could result in a reduced demand for certain of our
offeringswhichinturncouldnegativelyaffectourprofitability.
demand for certain of our products, systems solutions and services, in particular for elements of
our gas and power segment, is to acertain degreeaffected byoil andgasprices anddemandfor

prices and their volatility, as well as storage capacities, impact the business activities of our
customers from relevant industries and their investment behavior. historically, prices for crude
oil, refined products, natural gas and petrochemical products have fluctuated widely in response
to changes in many factors over which we do not and will not have control and which are
difficult to predict. on the one hand, in the event of long-term low or volatile oil and gas prices
or when such prices are expected to be low for a longer period in the future, our customers
whose activities in the oil & gas industry primarily depend on profitability may postpone
investments, affecting demand for certain parts of our offerings such as compressors, industrial
gas turbines, subsea products or other oil & gas products and solutions. customers might also
seek to renegotiate their contracts, which may lead to disadvantageous contract terms for us, as
has happened to a certain degree in the past. long-term low oil prices may eventually lead to
partial or full defaults on payments from our customers, as has happened to a certain degree in
the past during longer periods of low oil and gas prices. on the other hand, long-term high
pricesforoilandgascouldcauseanoveralleconomicrecession.
certain countries that are heavily dependenton income from oil and gasmaycurtail investments
in capital intensive oil and gas, as well as power generation and transmission projects during
periods of long-term low or expected low demand for oil and gas due to insufficient funds,
which in turn could lead to less demand for certain of our gas and power segment’s products,
solutionsandservices.

we may fail to adjust our organizational and manufacturing footprint in a timely manner or at
all, and such reorganizations may not yield the targeted benefits or may damage our
reputation.”).
long-term low or volatile oil and gas prices may put pressure on power generation from
renewables in the sgre segment and on the growth of our green hydrogen business due to
lower power generation costs for fossil fuel-based generation, which may prompt our customers
torevisitplannedprojects.
longer periods of low demand for our products, solutions and services from markets affected by
oil and gas prices and demand for oil and gas could eventually result in us having to record asset
impairmentsinourgasandpowersegment.
any significant adversedevelopments, including sustained low prices andvolatility, in oil andgas
markets could reduce customers’ demand for the group’s products, particularly in our gas and
power segment, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position
andresultsofoperations.
3.1.8 the wind power industry faces structural market changes, in particular declining
subsidy levels, and there can be no guarantee that siemens gamesa renewable
energywillsucceedinaddressingtheresultingchallenges.
our sgre segment is active in the wind power industry, providing products, solutions and
services for onshore and offshore wind power plants. historically, this industry has benefitted
from various direct and indirect subsidies aimed at facilitating wind energy production, e.g.,
economically favorable feed-in tariffs. in recent years, in most of our sgre segment’s markets,
governments have already reduced or withdrawn direct subsidies for wind power and in the
unitedstates,productiontaxcredits(anotherformofsupport)generatedbywindenergywillbe
completely phased out for projects commencing construction after 2020. similar support schemes
may continue to be significantly reduced or phased out entirely in other jurisdictions in the
future.further,theexpansionofonshoreandoffshorewindpowerplantsandrenewablesisalso
dependent on adequate development in other adjacent areas such as national infrastructure
(such as transmission networks) (see also “3.4.3 the markets in which we and our customers
operate are subject to several regulatory requirements which are subject to change.”). in
addition,demandforwindpowerequipmentisaffectedbythecostofwind-generatedelectricity
compared to the cost of electricity generated from other sources of energy, including not only
renewable sources (principally solar and hydroelectric power), but also gas, coal and nuclear-
fueled power generation. with a drive in many countries for diversification of energy sources,
modern biomass, geothermal, tidal and biofuels, as well as nuclear power, all compete for
governmental support and a prioritized focus. even though the levelized cost of wind-generated
electricity is decreasing as wind turbine design, production and installation continue to make
improvements in cost, efficiency, output and capacity factor (number of full-load hours),
competitiveness of wind power technology against other renewable and conventional power
generation technologies might deteriorate due to technological advances, declining carbon
pricesordecliningfossilcommodityprices.
furthermore, our sgre segment experiences competitive pressure among wind turbine
manufacturers, which have themselves contributed significantly to a reduction of prices for wind
turbine generators and may result in additional price pressure. competition in the wind power
industry has intensified due to factors such as the expansion of existing industry participants in
newmarketsandincreasingpressurefromasianmanufacturerswhostrivetoimprovethequality
and reliability of their technologies and move out of their local markets. in particular in certain
markets (mostly emerging markets) in which customers’ access to capital is restricted, successfully
23
marketing sgre products may be challenging, because certain customers in these markets are
more focused on price per megawatt than on the levelized cost of energy (full-cycle cost) or
similar parameters. in these cases, the customers’ pressure on pricing of capital expenditures
rather than efficiency may affect our sgre segment’s competitiveness. in addition, market entry

others, reduction in subsidies and additional competition, this could have a material adverse
effectonourbusiness,financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
3.1.9 extreme weather conditions due to climate change may have a negative effect on
ourbusiness.
climate change is leading to warmer weather and more extreme weather conditions. therefore,
climate change could affect our business and have a significant impact on siemens energy, most
likely in the medium- and long-term. longer and warmer seasons or extreme cold could
materially affect the operations of our customers and limit the attractiveness of our products.
severe weather, such as fires, hurricanes, high winds and seas, blizzards and extreme
temperatures may cause evacuation of personnel, curtailment of services and suspension of
operations,inability todelivermaterials tojobsitesinaccordancewithcontractschedules,lossof
or damage to equipment and facilities, supply chain disruption and reduced productivity. for
example, our sgre segment had to adjust its profitability target in january 2020 following
unforeseen costs in a low triple-digit million euro amount relating to five onshore projects (1.1
gw) in northern europe, mainly norway, caused by adverse road conditions and the unusual

3.2 risks related to our business
3.2.1 we may not be able to successfully implement our strategies; in particular we may
fail to successfully complete cost savings and other reorganization programs, benefit
from the disruptive trends in global energy markets and increase the share of our
servicebusiness.
our future operational performance and financial position depends to a significant degree on
the success of the strategic and operational measures we plan to implement or are currently
implementing.inparticular,ourstrategycomprisesthefollowingelements:
(cid:129) we have already initiated various reorganization and cost savings programs that we will
continue to pursue. in addition, we are currently evaluating further potential options to
improve our profitability, such as project excellence measures, streamlining of our portfolio,
footprint adjustments as well as re-sizing of functions. there is a risk that we may incur
substantial costs and cash outflows when implementing such programs and there can be no
guarantee that they will yield the targeted benefits (see also “3.2.11 in connection with
existing and potential future reorganization and cost savings measures, we may incur
substantial restructuring expenses and cash outflows. we may not be able to realize expected
cost savings or we may fail to adjust our organizational and manufacturing footprint in a
timely manner or at all, and such reorganizations may not yield the targeted benefits or may
damageourreputation.”).
(cid:129) we seek to benefit from the disruptive trends in global energy markets, namely demand
growth, decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization and there can be no guarantee
that we will be able to adapt our business model in time or at all (see also “3.1.1 the energy
market is subject to disruptive developments, such as the trend towards decarbonization, and
we may be too slow or even fail in adapting our business model and product portfolio.”).
while we aim to focus our research and development spending on growing market segments
and products that we expect to offer a sustainable competitive advantage, there can be no
24
guarantee that our research and development spending will deliver the targeted economic
benefits (see also “3.2.2 we may be unable to successfully develop and launch a portfolio of
competitive and technologically-advanced products, services and solutions, and our research
and development efforts may be unsuccessful. furthermore, the pace of technological change
may result in the economic life cycle of certain of our products being shorter than
anticipated.”). there is also a risk that such shift in focus in our research and development
spendingwillleadtoadeclineofourcompetitivepositioninourtraditionalcoreportfolio.
(cid:129) we seek to grow the share of our service business in our business mix, which has typically
higher margins than the products, systems and solutions businesses. should we fail to increase
such share, we may fail to achieve our profitability improvement targets. there is a risk that a
reduction in operating hours of the equipment provided by our generation and industrial
applications divisions may lead to lower service and modernization demand from our
customers (see also “3.1.1 the energy market is subject to disruptive developments, suchasthe
trend towards decarbonization, and we may be too slow or even fail in adapting our business
model and product portfolio.”). we may face more competition in our service business as
digital technologies and additive manufacturing continue to allow competitors to service our
installed baseatacompetitive cost/price level. forthesgresegment’sservicebusiness,thereis
a risk that wind farm operators will service their own fleet themselves or engage third-party
service providers (see also “3.1.4 competition and lower market prices could negatively affect
ourbusiness,financialpositionandresultsofoperations.”).
(cid:129) we have set ourselves certain goals to optimize the allocation of our resources, streamline our
portfolio and increase our performance. among others, we seek to further reduce
non-conformancecostsinourprojectandproductbusiness(seealso“3.2.6ourprojectbusiness
is subject to several risks, including execution risks, cost overruns, quality and political risks.”
and “3.2.3 operational failures in our value chain processes and quality issues could negatively
affect our business and reputation, and result in claims, penalties and additional costs.”). we
are also targeting an improvement in our cash conversion rate (i.e., free cash flow divided by
adjusted ebita), including by stricter working capital management, reducing costs resulting
from organizational complexity, footprint adjustments and strict return criteria for capital
expenditure and acquisitions. we are planning to reduce complexity and risks in our solution
businesses by limiting our exposure in engineering, procurement and construction (“epc”)
activities. there is a risk that this may lead to a lower pull-through of products and have a
negativebearingoncapacityutilizationinourfactories.
(cid:129) our sgre segment is in the process of realigning its strategy to the current market
environmentandisimplementingcorrespondingprogramstoimproveprofitability.
the achievement of targeted improvements of our performance depends not only on the
successful implementation of such measures but also on other developments, for example in
relation to the market environment, including market prices for our products, solutions and
services and cost increases, including costs for raw materials and components, which may be
beyond our control (see also “3.2.4 we are dependent on the availability of certain materials,
parts and components, and any disruptions in the supply chain may result in additional costs or
loss of revenues.”). furthermore, the assumptions underlying our planning could prove to be
incorrectormayneedtoberevisedinthefuture.inanysuchcase,ourstrategymaynotyieldthe
targetedimprovements.
3.2.2 we may be unable to successfully develop and launch a portfolio of competitive and
technologically-advanced products, services and solutions, and our research and
development efforts may be unsuccessful. furthermore, the pace of technological
change may result in the economic life cycle of certain of our products being shorter
thananticipated.
we may not be successful in developing a portfolio of technologically-advanced products,
services and solutions within the expected timeframe or at all, or at prices that allow our new
25
developments to be competitive when compared to similar products, services and solutions
availableinthemarket.
as evidenced by recently introduced digital offerings, such as the sensformer and sensgear
applicationsofourtransmissiondivision,omnivisedigitalservicesforapplicationsofourgasand
power segment’s divisions, the topsides 4.0 and pipelines 4.0 solutions offered by our industrial
applications division, we are constantly investing time and money in the digitization of our
portfolio. however, such investments may not translate into profitable business, or we may be
too slow or less successful than our industry peers, or new digital players whocouldbecomenew
competitors,inthefieldofdigitalofferingsrelatedtoourproducts.
the markets in which we operate experience rapid and significant changes due to the
introduction of innovative and disruptive technologies. our operating results have in the past
dependedandwill continuetodependtoasignificant extentonourabilitytomeettheevolving
needsofcurrent andprospective customers, ourability toanticipate andadapttochangesinour
markets and to optimize our cost base accordingly. optimizing the levelized cost of energy of its
products and its cost base is particularly important for our sgre segment as many of its products
are subject to significant price pressure. furthermore, in the area of electric energy storage, we
face the risk that competitors’ energy storage solutions are more cost effective than our own. in
addition, storage solutions may in the future reduce demand for peaker applications of our gas
turbine product lines. even if we succeed in developing innovative technologies, our competitors
may be able to commercialize similar technologies faster or more successfully than us.
introducing new products and technologies requires a significant commitment to research and
development, which in return requires expenditure of considerable financial resources that may
notalwaysleadtosuccessfulnewdevelopments.ourresultsofoperationsmaysufferifweinvest
in the development of technologies that may not operate or may not be integrated as expected.
technologies may not be accepted in the marketplace as anticipated. in addition, our products,
solutions or systems may fail to be introduced into the market in a timely manner, particularly
when compared to our competitors, or even become obsolete, negatively impacting our results
of operations. for example, there can be no assurance that the new gas turbine class that we are
currently developing will enable us to compete against the offerings of our competitors with
top-of-the-market efficiency levels, which are a key selling point for our customers. since our
service revenues depend to a large extent on our installed base of rotating equipment, fewer

the base of our future service revenues. in addition, our sgre segment’s onshore product
competitiveness could suffer if its portfolio optimization plans encounter delays or its products
may fail to meet market expectations. furthermore, in anticipation of eu legislation potentially
restricting or banning the use of sulphur hexafluoride (“sf ”), a greenhouse gas (“ghg”)
6
commonly used in gas-insulated switchgear, we have developed an sf -free gas-insulated
6
switchgear using compressed synthetic air. demand for our innovative switchgear solution has
already picked up following a restriction or ban of sf . however, some of our competitors have
6
opted to develop alternatives using other gases, which may prove more successful than our
technology.
sector coupling and “power-to-x” technologies expand our field of activity in sectors beyond
power generation, e.g., for green synthetic fuels (so-called “e-fuels”). it remains a risk that these
markets do not materialize to a relevant size and we maynotbeabletorecoupourinvestments.
furthermore, we may not be able to acquire the required technical competence, to successfully
develop projects and operate facilities for such solutions and technologies or to achieve
competitivecostlevels.
moreover, the pace of technological change may result in the economic life cycle of certain of
our products, in particular wind turbine models, being shorter than anticipated. for example,
these structural market changes put pressure on the established business model of wind turbine
providers such as our sgre segment, and sgre may fail to adapt its business model in time or at
all.

in an effort to secure proprietary technologies. however, our patents and other ip may not
prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services that are
similar to, or virtually duplicates of, ours. in addition, we have been pursuing a more selective
strategy in recent years when filing for new patents, which is aimed at reducing costs while at
the same time adequately protecting our innovations. this approach resulted in an increase in
the efforts required to defend against third-party ip rights and other measures to mitigate risks
relating to ip rights. if we fail to strike an adequate balance between cost reduction and an
adequate level of protection, we might not have the portfolio of ip rights required to be
competitive. this risk is further exacerbated by our activities in the area of additive
manufacturing.
3.2.3 operational failures in our value chain processes and quality issues could negatively
affect our business and reputation, and result in claims, penalties and additional
costs.
our value chains comprise all steps in the product life cycle, from research and development to
supply chain management, production, marketing, sales and services. failures in our value chain
processes could, among other things, result in quality, product safety or occupational safety
issues. such risks are particularly present in our engineering, production and manufacturing
facilities, which are located all over the world and have a high degree of organizational and
technologicalcomplexity.

other products, or affect whole production facilities or plants, resulting in consequential
damages significantly exceeding the value of the failing or malfunctioning product and might
cause bodily harm. these risks are particularly relevant in the area of gas turbines, steam
turbines, generators, auxiliary items and compressors, including the required spare parts for such
products, or the transmission product business. in connection with the introduction of new
technology or of main components for wind turbines, e.g., blades and bearings, this risk is
particularly pronounced. for example, quality problems related to gas turbine parts could affect
an entire product line of gas turbines which may already be installed or planned to be installed
at customer sites. this could result in, e.g., a shutdown of power plants, delays in project
commissioning, significant costs for fixing the quality problem and replacing or repairing defect
parts. for example, in a few instances customers alleged that a certain type of bushings, which is
no longer manufactured by us, had failed due to quality issues. although our investigations did
not reveal defects, we have settled a number of cases in which customers pursued legal action
against us, and it cannot be ruled out that further customers pursue claims against us in relation
to these bushings. as an example, with respect to our sgre segment, failures of wind turbine
generators could impact, and have already impacted, parts of our entire wind power plants.
similarly, and related to new technologies, the electrolyzer technology (such as the proton
exchange membrane (pem) technology) is still in an early phase of implementation and, because
operational data is rare, the lifetime of relevant products, systems and solutions cannot be
reliably predicted. it is also possible that, due to technological problems, certain components in
the existing fleet may not reach the expected lifetime, and the profitability in current or future
projectsmaydeteriorate.

inaddition,ifwefailtomeetagreedspecifications, technicalrequirementsorguaranteesforour
products, solutions or services, particularly in the context of contract bids or under existing
contracts relating to certain technical performance parameters, we may incur additional costs
(including significant non-conformance costs) and face claims for specific performance and
damages. any such cases could, in addition, have particularly detrimental consequences for our
reputation.
thereisnoguaranteethatourqualityassurancemeasureswillbeeffectiveenoughtodetectand
adequately respond to every quality assurance issue in a timely manner or at all. even if such
measures work as intended, responding to quality issues may result in significant additional costs
if quality issues arise that affect the installed fleet or sold new units of a product line. for
example, as reliability of rotating equipment is particularly critical in the power generation and
the oil & gas industry, any quality issue arising in connection with our rotating equipment could
have significant effects on electricity generation and oil & gas production or processing, result in
personal injury, property damage and environmental impairments, and lead to claims for
damages,includingconsequentialdamages,orcouldnegativelyaffectourreputation,specifically
ifwehavetoissueproductwarningsorsimilarcommunicationtoourcustomersortothepublic.
depending on our footprint strategy, we may also face quality issues due to outsourcing of the
productionofkeycomponentsandtheremaybecasesinwhichoursuppliersdonotcomplywith
ourtechnicalspecificationsorqualitymanagementsystems.
if the group were to be subject to any claims, liabilities, fines or other adverse actions by
customers or governments (e.g., claims based on warranty, guarantee or product liability), this
could expose us to reputational damage, significant additional costs and negatively affect the
performance of new projects and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business,
financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
3.2.4 wearedependentontheavailabilityofcertainmaterials,partsandcomponents,and
anydisruptionsinthesupplychainmayresultinadditionalcostsorlossofrevenues.
the financial performance of our operating units depends on reliable and effective supply chain
management for components, sub-assemblies and materials. capacity constraints and supply
shortages resulting from ineffective supply chain management may lead to production
bottlenecks, delivery delays and additional costs. we also rely on third parties to supply us with
parts, components and services. using third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our
products may reduce our control over manufacturing yields, quality assurance, product delivery
schedules and costs. unanticipated increases in the price of components or raw materials due to
marketshortagesorotherreasonscouldalsoadverselyaffectperformance.
although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid supply-related problems, there can be no
assurancethatwewill notencountersupplyproblems.especiallywhereweusesingle-sourceora
small number of suppliers for critical components, including, after spin-off completion, from
siemens aktiengesellschaft, munich and berlin, germany (“siemens ag”) or its direct and
indirect subsidiaries (together with siemens ag, the “siemens group” or “siemens”), any
business or relationship interruptions could harm our operations or increase our operating costs.
for example, siemens will continue to supply key components and software for control systems
which are used in several of our products and solutions and which cannot be replaced with
readily available third-party components. shortages and delays could materially harm our
businesses. these and similar market dynamics may also make it more difficult for us to find
alternative sources of supply at reasonable costs or at all. moreover, in the past, we have
experienced supply chain constraints regarding blades and vanes required for the operation of
ourturbines.duetotheexpectedlowdemandforturbinesandtheaccompanyingpricepressure,
our suppliers may seek customers from other industries and, thus, the overall number of our
potential suppliers may be reduced. such constraints can, for example, lead to delays or the
inability to deliver spare parts. this in turn may affect our ability to perform our contractual
obligations,whichmaysubjectustoclaimsofnon-performanceordamages.
28
in addition, many of the parts we require for the manufacturing of our products need to
undergoaqualificationprocess,whichmaytakelongerthanexpected,forexample,asaresultof
the increasing complexity of our turbine blades, vanes and electrolyzers. we may also experience
delays in launching new technology components into the market, resulting in potential loss of
upgraderevenues.
furthermore, we are exposed to the risk of delays and interruptions in the supply chain because
of catastrophic events, including adverse weather conditions, fire or pandemics or epidemics,
such as covid-19. the latter has resulted in the temporary closure of some of our sites. in
addition, cyber incidents or suppliers’ financial difficulties or insolvencies can cause supply chain
disruptions, particularly if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply or means of
transportation in a timely manner or at all. interruptions in the supply chain may lead to
consequential risks, which are particularly relevant for the execution of large projects. the need

the realization of any such planning miscalculations, disruptions or other unexpected
developments within the supply chain could significantly increase costs and have a material

3.2.5 we depend on the continuous efficient performance of our information technology
systems, which may be subject to cyberattacks and other disruptions. in addition, we
sell products and systems with digital capabilities and offer digital solutions, which
may be vulnerable to such attacks or disruptions. any such attack or disruption may
adversely affect our business operation, compromise theconfidentiality andintegrity
of data, and may result in administrative sanctions, civil liability and adversely affect
ourreputation.
informationtechnologies(“it”)aredeeplyintegratedintoourbusinessportfolio,andwedepend
on their uninterrupted and efficient functioning. in addition, we rely on third-party it service
providers. we observe a global increase of cybersecurity threats and higher levels of
professionalismincybercrime,whichposearisktothesecurityofproducts,systemsandnetworks
and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. our it environment could be
compromised, e.g., by attacks on our own or our it service providers’ networks that may also
include cloud services, social engineering, data manipulations in critical applications and a loss of
critical resources. in the past, successful cyberattacks on industrial companies were conducted
usingsocialengineeringwhichresultedinthelossofsignificant financialfundsorthefacilitation
of money laundering, e.g., by payment frauds or the manipulation of master data. there can be
no assurance that our own or our it service providers’ measures aimed at safeguarding the
uninterrupted and efficient functioning of it will address these threats under all circumstances.
any such attack or disruption may adversely affect our business operations. risks from
cyberattacks on our products and services can have particularly serious consequences because
they are often part of critical infrastructure whose limited functionality or total failure can have
far-reachingconsequences.
in addition, there is a risk that confidential or private information, including third-party
information, may be leaked, stolen or manipulated or compromised in other ways, including due
to any of the events mentioned above. leakageor theft of information about our ip rights could
affect our competitive position and results of operations. if confidential or private information is
compromised, we may also be subject to contractual penalties or claims for damages (see also
“3.2.3 operational failures in our value chain processes and quality issues could negatively affect
ourbusiness andreputation, andresult inclaims, penaltiesandadditionalcosts.”),administrative

cyberattacks and other disruptions could also result in deliberate improper access, and use, of
our sites or systems, as well as production downtimes and supply shortages, with potential
adverseeffectsonourreputation,ourcompetitivenessandresultsofoperations.
furthermore, we sell products and systems with digital capabilities and offer digital solutions,
e.g., for remote operation of assets or onsite operations such as instrumentation & controls for
29
power plants. we frequently partner with early stage companies, such as start ups, to provide
cybersecurity offerings and may be exposed to risks relating to the long-term viability of such
companies, in particular where we have sold products to customers with multi-year contracts. if
such products, systems and solutions are compromised or disrupted, including due to any of the
events described above, we may be held liable by our customers for damages, including
consequentialdamagesandmayalsosufferdamagetoourreputation.
these risks are further exacerbated by the fact that our potential attackers are increasingly
sophisticated and often supported by organized crime or even nation-states engaged in

3.2.6 our project business is subject to several risks, including execution risks, cost
overruns,qualityandpoliticalrisks.
we regularly engage in large and complex projects which may be worth, or even exceed a value
of, several hundred million euros and whose execution may take several years. such projects are
awardedonacompetitivebiddingbasisandinmanycases,weareresponsibleforthedesignand
construction of an entire turnkey plant project, including wind power plants. some of these
contracts are inherently risky because we may assume substantially all risks associated with
completing a project and meeting post-completion warranty obligations. for example, we have
to satisfy increasingly complex technical and regulatory requirements and we face the risk that
we do not fully consider all such requirements in our offer. this is particularly true in projects
with untested or new technology that have never been executed before, or when we bid for
projects in countries where we have no or only limited experience from previous projects. the
profit margins realized on fixed-priced contracts may vary from original estimates as a result of
changesincostsandproductivityoverthecontracts’terms.
in certain cases, we bear the risk of unanticipated project modifications, shortage of key
personnel, quality problems (which, for example, resulted in very significant non-conformance
costs in the fiscal year 2019), financial difficulties of our customers and/or significant partners,
cost overruns or contractual penalties caused by unexpected technological or technical problems,
unforeseendevelopmentsattheprojectsites,unforeseenchangesordifficultiesintheregulatory
or political environment, performance problems relating to our suppliers, subcontractors and
consortium partners, or logistical difficulties. for example, when executing large projects, we are
often required to form a consortium with other parties and customers regularly require that we
accept joint and several liability for our consortium partners. should such partners fail to deliver
on their part of the project, we could be held liable for expenses or other costs, including
damages. disagreements with our customers or our consortium partners regarding allocation of
additional project costs andresponsibilities (e.g., for delaysanddisruptions duringaproject), can
be time-consuming, expensive and may absorb significant management capacities. our project
business mayalsobenegativelyaffectedbyvariouseffectsofcovid-19(see“3.1.3ourindustries
and business operations are subject to various risks relating to global or local outbreaks of
infectious diseases and other public health crises. in particular, we are affected from the fallout
oftheoutbreakoftherecentcoronaviruspandemic.”).
in connection with a contract for the construction of the “olkiluoto 3” nuclear power plant in
finland for teollisuuden voima oyj (tvo), siemens ag will continue to be externally liable
vis-à-vis tvo and siemens ag’s consortium partners. due to a significant delay of the project,
tvo will likely raise delay claims against the consortium or may pursue termination of the
contract, potentially triggering additional significant claims from tvo. as between siemens ag
andsiemensenergy,siemensenergywillberesponsiblefortheexecutionoftheproject.siemens
ag has agreed to cover certain potential claims of tvo, to the extent these claims exceed
30
€ 83 million. however, in certain cases siemens energy may have to first satisfy such claims
vis-à-vis tvo and may only be able to obtain relief from siemens ag following legal proceedings
against siemens ag’s consortium partners. as a result, siemens energy may not be able to obtain
the aforementioned relief in time or in full, which could have a significant financial impact on
siemens energy. apart from the foregoing, siemens energy will be entitled to all benefits and
bear all risks associated with the project execution and siemens ag’s position as a party to the
consortium agreement, including risks related to warranty, availability, delays or non-completion
oftheproject.anyoftheserisks,iftheymaterialize,mayresultinsubstantiallosses.
some of our multi-year contracts also contain demanding installation and maintenance
requirements in addition to other performance criteria relating to timing, unit cost and
compliance with government regulations, which, if not satisfied, could subject us to substantial
contractual penalties, damages, non-payment and contract interruption, suspension or
termination. therecanbenoassurancethatcontracts andprojects, in particular thosewithlong-
term duration and fixed-priced calculation, can be completed profitably. where projects fail or
are delayed, we may face claims for penalties or damages from our partners or customers. for
example,oursgresegmentwasforcedtoadjustitsprofitabilitytargetinjanuary2020following
unforeseen costs in a low triple-digit million euro amount relating to five onshore projects (1.1
gw) in northern europe, mainly norway, caused by adverse road conditions and the unusual
early arrival of winter weather, which delayed project execution substantially. in the case of
transmission projects, customers may have to pay penalties or damages to power plant operators
fordelaysorinterruptionsofgridconnectionsandseektorecoupsuchdamagepaymentfromus.
in power plant projects, damages to power plant operators due to delays may also include
penalties or damages from regulators, investors or customers, with whom operators have signed
powerpurchaseagreements.
when developing new projects, we regularly incur upfront investments that may be lost if the
project does not materialize as planned or at all. in order to successfully develop new projects,
we require project development and investments specialists whose internal training is time-
consuming,whileexperiencedexpertsareinshortsupplyonthelabormarket.
the materialization of any such project-specific risks, planning miscalculations or other
unexpected delays or disruptions could lead to significant increases in project costs, negatively
affect the performance of projects and could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
3.2.7 customers may be successful in negotiating or renegotiating terms and conditions in
their contracts that are disadvantageous for us, leading to lower revenues and
profitability.
many of our customers are large companies with considerable bargaining power. these, or other
customers, may from time to time be able to negotiate terms and conditions in their contracts
that are disadvantageous for us, which could lead to lower revenues and margins. for existing
contracts, suchcustomersmayrequestrenegotiationsormayterminatetheircontracts. wherever
our customers’ ability to generate profits with the products and services we provide is negatively
affected, we have in the past encountered, and may in the future encounter, pressure to
renegotiate existing or future contracts. this is particularly relevant for long-term service
programs where our customers may consider enforcing contractual scope reductions and/or
changes in the operating profiles and commercial terms, or, alternatively, abandonor shut-down
existingplantsandterminatethelong-termprogramsentirely.customersmayalsochoosenotto
renew long-term programs (e.g., with respect to maintenance and other services) or seek early
termination, for example, to allow a competitor to service our products at a lower price. for
example, lower and more fluctuating demand for centrally produced energy negatively impacts
some of our long-standing customers. further circumstances which may prompt renegotiations
include higher prices for carbon-dioxide certificates, increasing shares of renewables, as well as
continuously low spot market prices for electricity. less operating hours of our installed fleet
could reduce the need for service activities, which may materially adversely impact our service
backlog volume and profitability. renegotiations or cancellations by our customers could
31
therefore significantly reduce the revenue and profit we are able to realize from our order
backlog.
in addition, the separation from siemens contemplates the transfer of certain contracts to
siemens energy. as such transfer in most cases requires the consent of the counterparty,
counterpartiesmayusetheconsentrequirementasleveragetoenterintorenegotiations.
3.2.8 we face risks relating to potential acquisitions, including difficulties regarding the
integration of the acquired business, and divestitures. similar risks exist in
connectiontoenteringintoorexitingfromjointventureswithpartners.
from time totime, in ordertoexecuteourstrategy, we maydivestouractivities insomebusiness
areas and strengthen others through portfolio measures, including mergers and acquisitions.
withthesameobjective,wemayenterintoorexitfromjointventureswithpartners.
with respect to divestitures, we may not be able to divest some of our activities as planned, and
the divestitures we do carry out could have a negative impact on our business situation, financial
position, results of operations and reputation. in addition, in the event of divestitures, acquirers
may successfully bring claims against us, e.g., based on alleged violations of representations and
warranties.
mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky because of difficulties that may arise when
integrating personnel, operations, technologies and products. there can be no assurance that
any of the businesses we acquire can be integrated successfully and on schedule, that they will
perform as anticipated once integrated, or that any potentially anticipated synergies canactually
be realized. moreover, we may be unable to retain key personnel and key customers of the
acquired businesses. we may also assume material unknown risks and liabilities if we fail to
accurately assess these prior to the acquisition, and there can be no assurance that we will have
recourse claims against the sellers of the acquired business. acquisitions may be capital intensive
and tie up valuable management resources. furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will
beabletoidentifysuitabletargetsorcompleteacquisitionsonfavorabletermsoratall.
in addition, we may incur significant transaction costs, administrative costs, tax and other
expenditures in connection with these transactions, including costs related to integration of
acquired businesses. furthermore, portfolio measures may result in additional financing needs
and adversely affect our capital structure. acquisitions can lead to substantial additions to
intangible assets, including goodwill, in our statements of financial position. if we were to
encounter continuing adverse business developments or if the acquired businesses were to
perform worse than expected, then these intangible assets, including goodwill, may have to be
impaired, which could adversely affect our business situation, financial position and results of
operations(seealso“3.3.2goodwillandotherintangibleassetsrepresentasignificantportionof
our total assets, which could be significantly reduced if we had to recognize impairments.”). for
example, our sgre segment incurred significant integration costs of € 109 million, € 90 million
and € 103 million in the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, after the merger of
gamesa and siemens’ wind power business that led to the formation of sgre s.a. in the nine-
month period endedjune30,2020,oursgresegmentincurred €116million integration costs in
connection with the merger and also with the integration of selected european senvion assets
acquiredinthesecondquarterofthefiscalyear2020,andfurtherintegrationcostsareexpected.
3.2.9 we may be unable to hire or retain enough qualified staff for key competence areas
and the current number of our staff may be insufficient to adequately address the
challengesweface,inparticularinexceptionalcircumstances.
competition for diverse and highly qualified personnel remains intense in the industries and
regions in which we operate. we have an ongoing need for highly skilled employees and a need
to enhance the diversity of our workforce. our future success depends in part on our continued
ability to identify, assess, hire, integrate, develop and retain engineers, digital talents,
experiencedlegalpersonnel,andotherqualifiedpersonnelonalllevels.ourconventionalenergy
activities may reduce our appeal to the personnel we seek to hire. we may lose highly qualified
32
employees and key personnel and the risk of losing key personnel and their know-how to
competitors may increase due to the spin-off or in case of any future reorganization plans and
theindividuallyperceiveduncertaintiesgoingalongwithsuchplans.
some of our employees are highly specialized and are difficult to replace. we are in the process
of implementing a number of core corporate functions as a stand-alone business (see “3.5.2 we
mayfacedifficulties in satisfying certain treasury andfinancerequirements aswell asperforming
certain services and functions that historically were provided by the siemens group.” below) and
the current number of our staff may be insufficient to adequately address the challenges we
face,inparticularinexceptionalcircumstances.
3.2.10 we are dependent on good relationships with our workforce. strikes or other labor-
related conflicts as well as rising wages or indirect labor costs could have a material
adverseeffectonourbusiness.
personnel expenses represent a significant cost factor for the group. most of our staff at the
german locations, and to a lesser extent elsewhere in the world, is covered by collective
bargaining agreements. although we believe that we have good relationships with our
workforce, works councils and unions, there is no assurance that when existing collective
bargaining agreements expire, new agreements will be concluded on terms that are satisfactory
tous.italsocannotberuledoutthatagreementswillonlybereachedfollowingstrikesorsimilar
actions. if production is affected over a longer periodoftime bylabordisputes, this couldhavea
material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. the
relationship with our employees may also be negatively affected by the disruptive trends in the
energy industry that require changes in our strategy and may require us to adjust our portfolio
and manufacturing footprint and thus to reduce our workforce. in our operations in emerging
markets, labor costs may continue to increase as a result of wage inflation in these countries and
rising unrest among low-paid people. indirect labor costs could increase, for example due to
continuedinflationofmedicalcosts.
3.2.11 in connection with existing and potential future reorganization and cost savings
measures, we may incur substantial restructuring expenses and cash outflows. we
may not be able to realize expected cost savings or we may fail to adjust our
organizational and manufacturing footprint in a timely manner or at all, and such
reorganizationsmaynotyieldthetargetedbenefitsormaydamageourreputation.
themarketsinwhichweoperateasaglobalsupplieroftechnologyfortheenergyandelectricity
sectors are subject to disruptive developments which have required us to adjust our
organizational and manufacturing footprint, including cost-out savings, to adapt to changing
market conditions, in particular market upswings or downswings and may require us to make
such adjustments in the future. our business prospects could be materially adversely affected if
we are unable to make such adjustments in time or at all. further reorganizations and
productivity programs may be required to adapt to a changing product portfolio or customer
basisortopricepressureinthemarket.
the implementation of potential reorganization programs in response to downswings or such
changes may from time to time require the reduction of personnel in some functional areas or
reorganization of manufacturing sites and may require us to incur significant restructuring
expenses (e.g., severance payments) that affect our results of operations. forexample, in ourgas
and power segment, various reorganization, performance enhancement and cost savings
programs were initiated in prior years, some of which are still ongoing, initiated in succession to
preceding measures, which were substantially completed. such programs have resulted in
substantial restructuring costs from personnel-related measures leading to severance charges in
our gas and power segment totaling € 247 million, € 375 million and € 43 million in the fiscal
years ended september 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and to € 31 million in the nine-
month period ended june 30, 2020. in our sgre segment, reorganization, performance
enhancement and cost savings programs were initiated, some of which are also still ongoing,
resulting in restructuring costs totaling €32million, €86million andnilinthefiscal yearsended
33
september 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and to € 41 million in the nine-month period
endedjune30,2020.
any reorganization measure may lead to significant cash outflows, including due to severance
charges. in addition, our ability to adapt our footprint or re-size our support functions quickly
maybelimitedduetolaborlawrestrictions,inparticularwhencomparedtocertaincompetitors.
furthermore, reorganization, performance enhancement and cost savings measures may not
yieldthetargetedresults.
the implementation of potential future measures may also result in substantial restructuring
expenses and cash outflows, which could end up being higher than planned, and the
implementation may take longer than originally expected or ultimately fail, e.g., due to
regulatoryrequirementsvaryingfromcountrytocountry.
in our gas and power segment, we evaluate the implementation of further potential
restructuring and optimization measures. for this purpose, the evaluation process is ongoing
focusing on shaping the exact scope and parameters, in particular for footprint optimization and
project execution for footprint consolidation, re-sizing of functions and integration of previous
acquisitions,andfurthermeasuresneededtoachieveprofitabilitytargets.noresolutionhasbeen
made yet on future measures and these measures are, inter alia, subject to consultation with
employee representatives. for the implementation of measures forming part of our existing
restructuring programs and potential further restructuring and optimization measures with the
targeted global cost savings, we believe that restructuring costs will amount cumulatively to a
mid to high triple digit euro million amount for fiscal years 2020 to 2023. furthermore, at the
time the evaluation process related to the further potential restructuring and optimization
measures crystalizes further, potentially in the near future already, this may lead to significantly
higher expenses and also to further restructuring measures associated with further expenses.the
increaseofexpensesassociatedwithrestructuringandoptimizationmeasuresmaynotnecessarily
correspondwithadditionalsavingsinallinstances.
inoursgresegment,wealsoevaluatetheimplementationoffurtherpotentialrestructuringand
optimization programs. within its new “leap” program, our sgre segment plans to maintain its
focus on productivity, asset management and operational excellence. as part of that, our sgre
segment will be constantly analyzing footprint optimization measures and also fixed costs,
including selling and general administrative expenses, among others, need to be optimized to
reach target profitability levels. for example, our sgre segment has recently announced a
restructuringplaninindiawhichwillhaveanimpactinthefiscalyear2021.inaddition,oursgre
segment is still investing in integration activities out of the merger that led to the formation of
sgre s.a. in fields such as it or in integration of acquired european senvion assets, among
others. in our sgre segment, we expect to incur integration and restructuring costs in the fiscal
years2021to2023ofuptoamidtripledigitmillioneuroamount,themajorityofthesecostsare
expected to be attributable to potential restructuring measures currently under evaluation. the
integrationmeasuresmaymainlyrelatetoitprojects,andmayalsoincludepotentialmeasuresin
connection with the integration of european senvion assets, while the potential restructuring
measures may primarily relate to turnaround efforts regarding the onshore business. both
integration and restructuring costs are expected to be substantially incurred by the end of the
fiscalyear2022.
failure to implement potential reorganization measures, including productivity programs, in
response to downswings could result in overcapacities, while failure to implement such measures
in response to upswings may result in loss of businesses. we may also lose key personnel if we
prove unable to adapt to changing market conditions. strikes and disputes with unions and
works councils may result in negative media coverageanddelivery problems. additionally, public
criticism related to a reorganization might negatively impact our reputation. even if we succeed
to implement potential reorganization measures as we see fit, there can be no assurance that
theywillyieldthetargetedcostsavings.
34
in addition, in certain countries, a part of our investment requirements for developing and
expanding our capacity and our product portfolio, in particular with respect to innovative
concepts, is sometimes covered by public aid, such as subsidies, loans at favorable conditions or
tax reductions or exemptions. if we were to close certain manufacturing plants or business lines,

3.2.12 weholdcertainminoritystakesindifferentcompaniesinwhichwehaveonlylimited

we hold certain minority stakes in companies, including in the context of joint ventures or other
cooperations and partnerships. examples include our participations in rwg (repair&overhauls)
limited, uk, maschinenfabrik reinhausen gmbh, germany, voith hydro holding gmbh & co.
kg, germany, and ethosenergy group limited, uk. in such cases, we have only limited influence
on the organization and business success of the entities concerned. thus, our ability to exploit
the strategic potential of such joint ventures, cooperations, partnerships and investments may be
impaired if we were unable to agree with our partners and co-shareholders on a common
strategy and its implementation. our interests may also conflict with the interests of other
shareholders in such entities, and we may be prevented from achieving our own goals, for
example due to the governance structure and rights allocation within the entity and the
applicable partnership agreements. any such conflicts may also give rise to claims, which can be
costly and time consuming and have a negative effect on the future performance of the joint
venture or entity. in case the entity underperforms, we may have to contribute additional,
unexpected funds to enable the continued operations of the entity or to service financial or
other debts of the entity, while we may still not be able to significantly influence the

negatively influencing the financial position and results of operations of our at-equity
investments and other investments could negatively affect the earnings contributions of such
investments or may result in impairments. for example, in the fiscal year ended september 30,
2018, siemens energy recognized an impairment loss of € 154 million related to an at-equity
investment presented in our gas and power segment. with a view to our at-equity investment in
siemensltd.,india(“siemensindia”),whichisalistedcompany,anobligationtowrite-downthe
value of this investment may be triggered by adecline in its publicly quotedshareprice thatmay
be lower than the carrying amount of the investment (see “3.5.10in certain countries, carve-outs
may be deferred or even fail or siemens will retain parts of the siemens gas and power business.
in these countries, limited access to the local markets, established facilities, research and
development resources may have an adverse impact on our business prospects and operations. in
addition, contractual agreements may require us to purchase the local business after termination
of the contract, which may result in significant cash outflows.”). in addition, our business
situation, financial position and results of operations could also be adversely affected in
connection with loans, guarantees or non-compliance with financial covenants related to these
investments.
if the group is unable to successfully engage with fellow joint ventures and partners it may not
be able to fully realize the strategic potential of such joint ventures and partnerships and this
mayhaveamaterialadverseeffectonourbusiness,financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
3.2.13 local content and local standard requirements may negatively impact our business
and place additional strains on our operations. non-compliance may result in claims
forpenalties,damagesorinterminationofcontracts.
some countries, e.g., australia, brazil, china, india, saudi arabia or russia, prescribe minimum
local content requirements by statute. such legislation may, among other things, require us to
35
purchase from local suppliers, recruit local staff, including executive staff, set up local
manufacturing facilities, or otherwise make direct investments in the relevant market.
furthermore,alargeportionoftheworld’s oilandgasreservesarecontrolledbystate-ownedoil
companies. state-owned oil companies may require us to meet local content requirements or
other local standards, such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local
partners, which couldbedifficult orundesirablefor us.similar obligationsmaybeimposedonus
by state-owned or state-affiliated energy companies outside of the oil sector. further, we could
also be forced to transfer business or technology into local majority holdings in order to access
certain markets. a failure to meet local content requirements and other local standards may
adversely impact our operations in such countries. this may result in inefficiencies, higher risks
resulting from increased complexities, lack of transparency, claims for penalties or damages or in
termination of contracts or reduced profitability. if we have to work with local suppliers orother
contractors, we may have difficulties ensuring proper production quality, e.g., due to limited
choice of contractors, a preferred vendor list or contractual stipulations. any unforeseen change
or reinforcements of local content or local standard requirements may result in additional costs
orinvestmentrequirementsinordertocomplywithsuchregulations.
if additional local content and local standard regulations are implemented, or if existing
regulations are enhanced, or if we fail to comply with the regulations, which could increase the
group’s costs and have a material adverseeffect onourbusiness, financial position andresults of
operations.
3.3 financial risks
3.3.1 wemayhavetowritedowninventoriesorotherassets,whichcouldadverselyaffect
ourfinancialpositionandresultinlossofprofitability.
we may have built up, or in the future may build up, inventories (both “work-in-progress” and
finished goods) that cannot be sold or only sold at lower-than-calculated prices, either because
there is insufficient demand from the market (e.g., due to an overall economic recession or
technological obsolescence) or intense competition. this may require us to write down the
carrying value of such inventory, negatively impacting our profit and financial position. for
example, in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2020, our gas and power segment had to
recognize inventory write-downs of € 225 million, related to a strategic portfolio decision on
certain small gas turbine platforms due to a change in addressing segments of the industrial
application market. our sgre segment recognized a write-down of inventories in an amount of
€ 102 million in this nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, as a result of the deterioration of
theindianmarketandthecorrespondingrestructuringplan.
the risk of write-downs is particularly present in the case of goods with longer lead times and
where we are unable to quickly adapt our supply chain (e.g., deliveries received for parts and
components) to the current load situation. this risk is further exacerbated by the decreasing
market demand for gas turbines which has led to an increase in the inventory of gas turbines.
impairment charges may also have to be recognized in respect of developed products and
associatedproductionlines,plants,realestate,productiontoolingandotherassets.furthermore,
we have in the past manufactured products in anticipation of orders which failed to materialize.
in some of these instances, we were required to write down the resulting inventory and there
canbenoguaranteethatwewillbeabletoavoidsuchcasesinthefuture.
3.3.2 goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total
assets,whichcouldbesignificantlyreducedifwehadtorecognizeimpairments.
goodwill, as presented in our combined financial statements, comprises the goodwill
attributable to the sgre segment, as well as goodwill attributable to the gas and power
segment. as of june 30, 2020 and september 30, 2019, the carrying value of goodwill amounted
to € 9,593 million and € 9,815 million, or 21.1% and 21.8% of our total assets as presented in
our combined statements of financial position, primarily related to the acquisition of dresser
rand and the merger that led to the formation of sgre s.a. other intangible assets also
36
represent a significant share of total assets. as of june 30, 2020 and september 30, 2019, the
carrying value of other intangible assets amounted to € 4,016 million and € 4,743 million, or
8.8% and 10.5% of our total assets as presented in our combined statements of financial
position. an impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-
generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount which is the higher of: the fair value less cost of
disposal; and the value in use. impairment losses may result from, among other things,
deterioration in performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or
regulations and a variety of other factors. for example, in the third quarter of the fiscal year
2020, we recognized impairments of intangible assets related to small gas turbine platforms due
to a change in addressing segments of the industrial application market in the gas and power
segment in an amount of € 476 million. in our sgre segment, we recognized an impairment of
intangible assets in an amount of € 82 million in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, as
a result of the deterioration of the indian market and the corresponding restructuring plan. any
of the aforementioned factors may cause an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
iftheyhavealastingnegativeimpactonourbusiness.theamountofanyquantifiedimpairment
must be expensed immediately as a charge to our results of operations. therefore, dependingon
future circumstances, it cannot be ruled out that we may not realize the full value of our
goodwill or other intangible assets. any determination of impairment of goodwill or other
intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations, and, in addition, may significantly deteriorate the confidence of important
stakeholders.
3.3.3 weareexposedtocreditrisksandmayneedtowriteofforwritedownreceivablesif

to discharge its obligations in full andontime orif thevalueofcollateral declines. wemayincur
losses if the credit quality of our contractual partners deteriorates or if they default on, or fall
behind schedule with, their payment obligations to us. we are in particular exposed to credit
risks relating to trade receivables arising from our ordinary course of business, i.e., trade
receivables from the sale of goods and services. this may also be the case if we are unable to sell
trade receivables due to a changing macroeconomic environment. a decision to write down or
write off claims against contractual partners involves management judgment and review of
individual receivables based on individual customer creditworthiness, current economic trends
and analysis of historical bad debts on a portfolio basis. the write-off or write-down of our
receivables may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of
operations.
3.3.4 our business and the businesses of our customers and suppliers require access to
significant credit and guarantee lines and other financing instruments. our business
activities could be negatively affected if we are unable to meet our capital
requirements in the future, for example in weak financial market environments, as a
result of a significant deterioration of our credit standing or of a breach of a credit
facility agreement, or if access to capital becomes more expensive. our business
activities could be similarly negatively affected if our customers or suppliers do not
haveaccesstofinancingoneconomicallyviableterms.
since the energy industry is subject to considerable technological change, our future capital
requirements for the development and industrialization of new products, future acquisitions,
investments and necessary reorganization measures may be significant. reflective of our
substantialprojectbusiness,ourworkingcapitallevelshaveinthepast,andareexpectedtobein
thefuture,volatile.
our ability to obtain debt financing, guarantees or derivative or hedging lines from financial
institutions at commercially acceptable terms, including volume and costs, could depend on
several factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, the
availability of credit from financial institutions, market interest rates and global and eu
37
monetary policy and financial markets regulation. in addition, deterioration in our business
results, financial position or credit ratings of siemens energy ag and/or sgre s.a. could lead to
higher financing and hedging costs, to reduced availability of credit, hedging and guarantee
lines, reduced access to capital markets, other commercially unfavorable terms or an acceleration
ofloansorprovisionofsecurity.
furthermore, our sgre segment and the other siemens energy group companies will be treated
as a so-called “single borrower unit” (kreditnehmereinheit) under the large exposure regulation
forbanksunderthegermanbankingact(kreditwesengesetz).anyindebtednesstakenonbyour
sgre segment may, therefore, limit the ability of siemens energy as a whole to borrow funds,
having access to hedging lines and obtaining guarantees and vice versa. absent sufficient future
cash flows and available financing and other credit lines, such as guarantees and derivative lines,
we may not be able to adequately finance our normal business activities and to realize new
investments or acquisitions or continue our daily operations, which could in turn have a material
adverse effect on our growth prospects, our competitive position and our business, financial
positionandresultsofoperations.
we concluded a syndicated facility agreement with a multi-currency revolving credit facility of
€ 3 billion in july 2020. sgre s.a. concluded, among other things, a syndicated multi-currency
revolving facility and loan agreement with a term loan tranche of € 0.5 billion and a revolving
credit line tranche of € 2.0 billion in may 2018, which was amended and extended in december
2019. the revolving credit facilities are for general business purposes. during the term of the
facility agreements, we must comply with the obligations, covenants and restrictions set out
therein. in the event of a breach of certain contractual obligations, or the non-fulfillment of a
repayment obligation, or, via a cross-acceleration provision relating to other financial
indebtedness incurred by us, exceeding a certain threshold amount, there is a risk that the
lenders terminate the facility agreement for cause. in the event of such termination, the
outstanding amounts would be immediately due for repayment, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. similar risks may
applydependingontheindividually agreedtermsoflocalcreditfacility agreements.intheevent
of a breach of certain contractual obligations or the non-fulfillment of payment obligations
under credit facility agreements, these agreements may be terminated and the financial
institutions will not grant further credit, including guarantees. derivative, hedging lines and
other financial instruments may contain cross-default clauses that allow termination. upon
terminationofcertainoftheseagreements,marketvaluecompensationmayhavetobepaid.
our business activities could be similarly negatively affected if our customers or suppliers do not
haveaccesstofinancingoneconomicallyviabletermsoriftheyortheirlendersrateourabilityto
execute capital intensive turnkey projects worse due to a deterioration of our financial position,
results of operation or credit ratings. this risk may be further exacerbated as the business
activities of siemens energy focus exclusively on energy market segments. prior to our separation
from siemens, we benefitted from the strong credit ratings of siemens ag, e.g., as the principal
ofparentcompanyguarantees.inthefuture,suchsupportbysiemenswillnolongerbeavailable
tousfornewprojects. siemensenergyagandsgres.a.havereceivedinvestmentgraderatings.
however, the ratings of siemens energy ag and sgre s.a. are lower than the rating of siemens
ag, and it remains to be seen to what extent such lower credit ratings will be a competitive
disadvantage. this risk could be further exacerbated if siemens energy ag’s or sgre s.a.’s
creditworthiness were to deteriorate. without investment grade rating, we could facesignificant
challenges in winning new contracts, substantially increasing financing and hedging costs and
refinancing risks as well as substantially decreasing availability of credit lines, e.g., for financing,
guaranteeandhedgingpurposes.
further, development of and bidding for large projects, in particular of the gas and power
segment’s generation division and of the sgre segment, may require arrangement of
co-financings of respective projects, e.g., by means of providing development loans, structured
debt financings and/or equity investments. we face the risk that we may not be able to provide
such financings either directly or indirectly via the involvement of third parties which may
negatively impact our ability to successfully bid for such projects. while we have concluded a
38
preferred financing agreement with siemens under which siemens, as first priority partner, is
willing to offer, under certain conditions, debt and commercial financing as well as, up to a
defined maximum amount, equity financing for gas and power customers and their projects
(including power plant projects) at arm’s length through its financial services operations, this
agreement may be terminated by either party. termination may be affected for, among other
reasons, if (i) siemens’ directly orindirectly holdsless than25%ofthesharesand/orvotingrights
in the company (excluding shares directly or indirectly held by siemens pension-trust e.v. or any
other entity holding or managing plan assets under or in connection with siemens group’s
benefit plans) or (ii) another shareholder, either individually or acting in concert with others,
holds 25% or more of the shares and/or voting rights in the company or exercises control over
thecompany,in bothcases, (i) and(ii), with aphase-outperiodof36monthsfromthereceiptof
an effective termination notice. in the case of a termination pursuant to item (i), however, the
receipt ofatermination notice duringthefirst threeyearsoftheterm ofthepreferredfinancing
agreement results in the 36-month phase notice period commencing on the third anniversary of
the spin-off completion. sgre also concluded a preferred financing agreement with nearly
comparable terms with siemens. if (i) the preferred financing agreements are terminated, (ii) not
properly implemented by the parties or (iii) thereis needfor financing supportbeyondthescope
contemplated in the preferred financing agreements, we may not be able to set up our own
capabilities in the required scope to provide financing for customers or may only be able to
procureexternalfinancingfromothersourcesatpotentiallyincreasedcostswhencomparedwith
the conditions of the preferred financing agreements. insofar as projects depend on adequate
financingcapabilities,wemayloserevenueoronlyachievelowerprofits.
siemens energy makes use of different national ecas, which support and promote national
exports by providing risk coverage for lenders and exporters. in order to benefit from ecas’
support, we have to comply with their terms and conditions. failure to comply with the terms
and conditions of the eca’s cover decision may result in the loss of the respective project-specific
eca cover and in combination with an indemnification event this could result in reclaims from
the eca or lenders. if these ecas change their terms and conditions and regulations or the
respective national government or entities with regulatory power change the basis for the mode
of operation of the respective ecas, this may impact siemens energy and our customers’ and
lenders’ ability to benefit from eca support and could thus negatively impact the demand for
ourofferings.
with respect to esg, increasingly strict financial institutions’ internal, industry-wide or policy-
driven prerequisites for all dimensions of esg may negatively impact siemens energy’s
capabilities to procure funding, securities, hedging instruments, insurance or other financial
services from banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. in particular, with
regard to sustainable financing, the eib announced in november 2019 that it will end financing
for fossil fuel energy projects from the end of 2021, and that its future financing will focus on
accelerating clean energy innovation, energy efficiency and renewable energy. in addition, the
eib stated that it would align all financing activities with the goals of the paris agreement from
the end of 2020. furthermore, the eu’s taxonomy for sustainable activities includes an action
plan for financing of sustainable growth, which is aimed at facilitating certain sustainable
investments. if, based on such sustainability policies or other policies related to different
dimensionsofesg,banksweretorefusetoprovidefinancingto,orissueguaranteesfor,siemens
energy or ecasproviding supportandrespective risk coverage,this couldhaveanegativeimpact
on the availability of attractive financing for siemens energy’s business. such policies may also
limit our customers’ ability to obtain attractive financing, which may result in a lower demand
for our offering. similarly, internal esg guidelines may prevent certain investors from providing
equityfinancingtous.
furthermore, financial institutions increasingly demand representations in financing contracts
with regard to compliance with sanctions or other export control measures. failure to comply
with sanctions and other control regimes may adversely impact our financing ability. we believe
these risks are particularly relevant with a view to our oil & gas and conventional generation
activitiesandwillmakethefinancingforsuchprojectsmoredifficult.
39
3.3.5 we are exposed to currency fluctuation risks in various countries that could
materially adversely affect our profitability and cause fluctuations in cash flow and
reportedearningsaswellasourequity.
due to the global scale of our business and the high level of regionalization of many of our
businesses, our results of operations are affected to a significant extent byforeignexchangerate
movements. there are transactional risks which arise when we and our subsidiaries execute
transactions in a currency other than our or our subsidiary’s respective functional currency. the
largest project execution, engineering, production and research and development hubs of our
business are in germany, the u.s., the uk, spain, denmark and china while our sales are global.
this means that while income is generated in various currencies, costs are predominately
denominatedineuro,u.s.dollar,britishpound,danishkroneandrenminbi.
foreigncurrencyexposureispartlybalancedbypurchasingofgoods,commoditiesandservicesin
the respective currencies as well as production and other contributions along the value chain in
local markets. we seek to manage the transaction exposure resulting from contractual
commitments as well as planned transactions in foreign currencies in a way thatatleast 75%but
no more than 100% of the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged. if applicable, for such
hedgingtransactionshedgeaccountingisusedtoreduceearningsvolatility. however,changesin
currency exchange rates generally cannot be predicted and cannot always be hedged on
economically reasonable terms, and there can be no assurance that our hedging and other risk
mitigation strategies will always be successful in mitigating currency risks. if we are unable to
match sales revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, our
results of operations may be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. in case of
unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations, we may be able to offer our products only at
comparatively higher prices or lower profit margins. this currency-related competitive
disadvantage can lead to a decline in revenue or a lower profit margin for siemens energy. firm
bids and offers in a currency other than the respective functional currency of the concerned
siemens energy company may create a currency risk, which are generally not hedged. there is
also the risk that currency conversion restrictions or cross-border money transfer prohibitions,
either by administrative orders or due to banks’ policies, occur that may prevent us from
converting or transferring funds for a certain period of time or at all. discrepancies between the
maturity and cash flow profiles ofhedginginstruments andunderlyingtransactions mayresult in
volatility of cash flows, e.g., from cash settlements with banks when hedges expire prior to the
underlying transaction due to local hedge limitations, e.g., in case of non deliverable forwards in
brazil. this and any negative effects from currency exchange rate exposure could haveamaterial
adverseeffectonourbusiness,financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
we are also exposed to foreign exchange translation risks through the translation of our foreign
subsidiaries financial statements into the euro for the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements. due to the foregoing, changes in exchange rates between our local currencies and
theeurocouldleadtosignificantchangesinourfinancialpositionfromperiodtoperiod.
3.3.6 we have assumed significant pension liabilities, and we are unwinding and
establishing employeeparticipationprograms,theactualcostsincurredinconnection
withtheresultingliabilitiesmaysubstantiallyexceedourcurrentestimates.
pension benefits are granted to a large portion of the employees of siemens energy. these
obligations have been grouped in different pension plans depending on the legal, economic and
taxenvironmentoftherelevant countries. foramajor part, thepensionschemesaredesignedas
defined benefit plans, either funded in the form of external plan assets (so-called “pension plan
assets”) or unfunded. the provisions for pensions and similar obligations may be affected by
changes in actuarial assumptions, including the life expectancy, the discount rate, as well as by
movementsinfinancialmarkets.
actual developments may differ from assumptions, e.g., due to changing market and economic
conditions, thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the actual obligations. significant
fluctuations in the financial markets or a change in the portfolio mix of plan assets can result in
significant increases or decreases in the attributable fair value of plan assets over time. this
40
applies particularly to equity securities. also, changes in the valuation assumptions of pension
obligations can affect the defined benefit obligation. for example, a change in discount rates, in
particular, may result in changes in the defined benefit obligation. a one-half percentage point
increase in the assumed discount rates would have led to a decrease in the defined benefit
obligations of € 209 million for the fiscal year ending september 30, 2019. a reduction of one
halfpercentagepointoftheassumeddiscountrateswouldhaveledtoanincreaseofthedefined
benefitobligationof€246millionforthefiscalyearendingseptember30,2019.
asofjune30,2020,we haddefinedbenefitobligations of€3,380million. thefair valueofplan
assets amounted to € 2,315 million. including the increasing effect ofasset ceiling of€1million,
this led to a net defined benefit balance of € 1,067 million as of june 30, 2020. as of june 30,
2020, provisions for pensions and similar obligations in our combined statements of financial
position amounted to € 1,095 million. plans with net assets were recognized in other assets with
an amount of € 29 million as of june 30, 2020. a significant increase in the underfunding may
have a negative effect on our capital structure and rating, and thus may tighten refinancing
optionsandincreasecosts.
we may face the risk of increasing cash outflows if local pension regulations require higher
fundinglevelsorchangeotherwise.
furthermore, the legal conditions governing our pension obligations are subject to changes in
applicable legislation or case law. we may incur new or more extensive pension obligations in
the future due to changes in such legislation and case law, or changes may negatively impact
previous calculations with respect to our pension obligations. moreover, future amendments to
accountingstandardsmayaffectourpensionobligations.
finally, many of our employees participate in employee participation programs established and
maintained by siemens. in connection with the spin-off, we will be unwinding these programs
for our employees by, among other things, making cash payments to relevant employees. the
payout amount is generally based on the publicly quoted price of the shares in siemens on the
transactiondate.thehigherthequotedsharepricethehighertheamountthatmustbepaidout
to relevant employees. accordingly, if the share price levels exceed current assumptions, actual
costs could be significantly higher than currently expected. furthermore, we will be establishing
employee participation programs similar to those in which our employees participated when we
were a part of siemens group. the costs for these programs may significantly exceed current
expectations.

for the fiscal year 2023, we target our adjusted ebita margin before special items in a range

the company’s executive board (the “executive board”) has based the profit forecast as well as
the other profitability and revenue targets on a number of assumptions, which are inherently
subject to significant business, operational, economic and other risks and many of which are
outside of our control. accordingly, such assumptions may change or may not materialize at all.
should one or more of the assumptions underlying the profit forecast as well as the other
profitability and revenue targets prove to be incorrect, our actual results of operations for the
respective future period(s) could differ materially. as a result, investors should not place undue
relianceonthem.
3.4 compliance, regulatory, legal and tax risks
3.4.1 we are subject to risks from disputes and administrative, legal and arbitration
proceedingswhichcouldresultinpenalties,damagesandlossofreputation.
siemens energy is, and potentially will be in the future, involved in several administrative, legal
and arbitration proceedings in various jurisdictions. frequently encountered situations include
claims from or against project partners and customers regarding delays and disruptions,
non-performance as well as labor disputes, antitrust issues, product liability, warranty claims and
ip rights. the significance and outcome of these proceedings can vary greatly, and many of these
cases could have considerable negative consequences for us. these proceedings could result in
siemens energy being subject to, e.g., payment of contractual penalties or damages (including
punitive damages), equitableremedies orsanctions, fines ordisgorgementofprofit.inindividual
cases,legaldisputesmayalsoleadtoformalorinformalexclusionfromtendersortherevocation
or refusal to renew or grant business licenses or permits. some of these legal disputes and
proceedings could result in adverse decisions for siemens energy or decisions, assessments or
requirements of regulatory authorities could deviate from our expectations, which may have
material effects on our business activities as well as our financial position, results of operations
and cash flows. high-profile proceedings can also divert management attention, result in
significant litigation and arbitration costs as well as negative publicity, and harm our reputation.
in some cases, our reputation may suffer regardless of the merits of the claim and the outcome
of the proceedings. moreover, siemens energy may incur losses relating to legal proceedings
beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of its insurance or exceeding any provisions made for
lossesrelatedtolegalproceedings.
as of the date of this prospectus, siemens energy group companies are party in the following
materiallitigations:
(cid:129) sgre is currently involved in a customer claim regarding a commercial dispute relating to
execution delays in a project. towards the end of 2019, the customer alleged that sgre has
delayed the project and is claiming liquidated damages for the delays up to the contractual
capped amount. in early 2020, sgre successfully objected to (and was thus granted a court
injunction against) the drawdown of bank guarantees by the customer. with respect to the
relevant customer contract, sgre rejects the claim. currently, sgre intends, and continues to
make reasonable efforts, to reach an amicable solution with the customer duringthecourseof
2020.however,itcannotberuledoutthatthecasewillleadtolitigation.
42
(cid:129) in addition, sgre is party to a number of license agreements, which afford sgre ip rights (in
particular, patents, trademarks and design rights). in a few individual cases, there have been
disputes or disagreements resulting from the interpretation regarding the execution of the
existing agreements or from the interpretation of the scope of use rights granted by third
parties (including competitors) to sgre regarding their respective ip rights, or with respect to
alleged ip infringements. while some of those disputes in the past years have been finally
solved by court in favor of sgre, others are still awaiting a final resolution, or have not
reached a court stage and still remain to be solved between the respective parties. on july 31,
2020, general electric company (“ge”) filed intellectual property related lawsuits against sgre
entities with the district court (landgericht) in düsseldorf, germany, and before the u.s.
international trade commission (“itc”) asserting a violation of two patents with regard to
certain variable speed wind turbine generators and components. the german lawsuit seeks an
injunction against sgre, mainly in relation to the manufacturing, offering and marketing of
therelevantwindturbinegeneratorsandcomponentsingermany,andfinancialcompensation
for any (alleged) infringing action performed after july 15, 2020. the u.s. itc complaint seeks
an exclusion order against sgre’s importation of certain wind turbine equipment into the
united states. should the complainant be successful, the financial burden to sgre could be
significant. there is the risk that sgre will not be able to complete projects or to win new
projects for which the affected wind turbine generators or components are required in
germany and/or the united states, or will only be able to do so at a higher cost (e.g., if it had
to resort to alternative generators or components). furthermore, if ge’s patents were found to
be valid and infringed upon by sgre, sgre could be forced to obtain a license from ge. sgre
will be defending against ge’s claims. in addition, sgre has launched an opposition appeal
before the european patent office in munich, germany, against the european patent which is
the basis of the german lawsuit; a resolution on the appeal is still pending. it cannot be
excluded that sgre will be involved in further disputes of such kind in individual cases in the
future.
with regard to certain legal disputes and proceedings related to our business in which siemens
group is or will become a party, siemens energy bears the economic consequences although we
are not or will not become a party due to legal requirements in disputes or due to the fact that
underlying contractual arrangements have not been transferred to us. pending proceedings of
siemens group under which we bear the economic consequences include the following material
litigations:
(cid:129) in december 2016, the borwin offshore consortium (“borwin”) established between siemens
ag and another company filed a lawsuit against tennet offshore 1. beteiligungsgesellschaft

conversely, we are, and may in the future become, a party to legal proceedings that relate to
business operations that will remain with siemens after our separation from siemens. in some
countries, the separation of siemens energy from siemens group was executed by way of a
reverse carve-out, i.e., the businesses within an existing regional company that shall remain with
siemens group were transferred out of such regional company into a newly established siemens
group legal entity, while the existing regional company became part of the siemens energy
group. as a result, legal proceedings against such regional company arising in connection with
business activities that were previously conducted by such regional company and that do not
pertain to the siemens energy business will remain with such regional company. siemens energy
group and siemens group have concluded agreements to allocate the resulting financial risks in
accordance with the separation of the business activities. however, it cannot be excluded at this
stage that, as a result of those legal proceedings, such regional company might also be
(temporarily or permanently) barred from conducting certain or any business in the respective
region,orevenbedissolved.suchanoutcomecouldalsodamageourreputation.wemaynotbe
able to fully recover any losses resulting from such legal proceedings under the risk allocation
agreements with siemens. this also applies to legal proceedings in brazil among others resulting
out of siemens’ businesses transferred into newly established siemens group legal entities (such
as siemens infraestrutura e indústria ltda., siemens mobility ltda., siemens healthcare
diagnósticos s.a.). these legal proceedings remain with siemens energy’s subsidiary siemens
ltda.inbrazil.
3.4.2 our operations are subject to trade and economic sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-
corruption, anti-money laundering and antitrust laws and regulations and the risk of
fraud.
we must comply with trade and economic sanctions, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and
regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. in particular, our international operations
expose us to potential liability under the united states foreign corrupt practices act 1977
(“fcpa”), the uk bribery act of 2010 and any applicable law, rule or regulation promulgated to
implement the organization for economic cooperation and development convention on
combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions, signed
december 17, 1997, and other similar laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption. the fcpa
and the uk bribery act 2010 prohibit us and our officers, directors, employees and business
partners acting on our behalf, including agents, from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing
or providing anything of value to a “foreign official” for the purposes of influencing official
decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. the uk
briberyactalsoprohibits“commercial”briberynotinvolvinggovernmentofficials,andaccepting
bribes as well as facilitation payments. we are also subject to anti-money laundering laws and
regulations, including the eu’s 5th anti-money laundering directive, and antitrust laws and
regulationsprohibitingcollusiveandotheranti-competitivepractices.
our business involves close and continuous contact with representatives of national governments
and other officials, and in particular officials who are in a position of awarding government
contracts and who therefore come within the scope of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.
some of the countries in which we operate lack a legal system that is as developed as those of
44
other countries, and may be perceived to have higher levels of bribery or corruption, including
illegal procurement practices. as we use subcontractors in many ofourprojects in suchcountries,
wefacetheriskthatsuchcontractorsmayengageinfraudulentactivity,corruptionorbribery,or
may circumvent or override our internal controls (see also “3.4.4. our risk management and
internal controls may not prevent or detect compliance risks, which could result in investigations
by authorities, fines, damage claims, payment claims, the termination of relationships with
customers or suppliers and even governmental exclusion from businesses (blacklisting) as well as
reputational damage. further, our internal controls could fail to detect business risks in time or
atall.”).
ourbusinessalsomustbeconductedincompliancewithapplicableeconomicandtradesanctions
laws and regulations, such as those administered and enforced by the u.s. department of
treasury’s office of foreign assets control, the u.s. department of state, the u.s. department of
commerce, the german ministry of economic affairs and energy, the united nations security
council and other relevant sanctions authorities. our global operations expose us to the risk of
violating, or being accused of violating, economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations. in
addition, rapidly changing export control rules and regulations regarding business activities in
critical countries, especially export control rules and regulations existing in the united states,
which have extraterritorial reach, may lead to a risk of inadvertently violating specific countries’
export control regulations and laws. our failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws and
regulations may expose us to reputational harm as well as significant penalties, including
criminalfines,imprisonment,civilfines,disgorgementofprofits,injunctionsanddebarmentfrom
government contracts, as well as other remedial measures. for example, the investigations into a
possibleviolationofexportcontrollawsinconnectionwithgasturbinesmanufacturedbyusand,
contrarytocontractualagreements,deliveredtoandinstalledincrimeabyathirdparty,resulted
in negative publicity. additionally, the hamburg public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings
against siemens’ employees in regard of alleged violations of the german foreign trade and
payments act (außenwirtschaftsgesetz). although internal investigations have not revealed
misconduct by siemens employees, these public investigations are still ongoingandanypotential
outcomesmaynegativelyaffectourreputation.
past examples of sanctions imposed by the u.s. adversely impacting our business include the
interference with our business activities in iran following the imposition of u.s. sanctions against
the country in 2018. even if we do not terminate our business operations entirely, we may be
incentivized to suspend the execution of projects involving countries or persons subject to such
sanctions. moreover, the u.s. has granted waivers to iraq for purchasing electricity and gas from
iran. if the u.s. administration decides to not renew these waivers or imposes some form of
sanctions or other restrictive measures concerning iraq, such actions could have negative
implications for our business in iraq (see “3.1.6 political instability, international conflicts or new
trade barriers may have a negative effect on our business, financial position and results of
operations.”).
in addition, such sanctions may impact us indirectly. for example, if our third-party service
providers cease to render services to us in order to comply with sanctions applicable to them,
banks may refuse to facilitate financial transactions or provide guarantees. additionally, banks
may not provide financing to our customers if they are sanctioned or may become sanctioned in
the future. sanctions-related risks are further exacerbated by the fact that compliance with
sanctions of one country may constitute a violation of the anti-sanction legislation of another,
potentially leading to civil or even criminal liability of us or our representatives. forexample, the
european commission has adopted anti-boycott rules forbidding companies from the eu to
complywiththe2018u.s.sanctionstargetingiran.
if we or any party related to us is found to have acted in contravention of trade and economic
sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering or antitrust laws or to have
engaged in fraudulent behavior, it would have a material adverse effect on our reputation,
competitivepositionand,ultimately,ourresultsofoperations.

3.4.3 themarketsinwhichweandourcustomersoperatearesubjecttoseveralregulatory
requirementswhicharesubjecttochange.
as a group with a global business, we are exposed to various product- and country-related
regulations, laws and policies influencing our business activities and processes. since we provide
products and services to customers that are active in regulated energy markets, we are indirectly
affected by the regulatory environment applicable to our customers. changes in regulatory
environments for us and our customers could adversely affect us and our customers, including by
reducingdemandforourproducts,increasingcostsandreducingprofit.
the regulatory environment relevant to our generation and industrial applications divisions is
currently significantly changing, in particular due to increased government intervention to limit
climate change by shifting energy production towards the use of more sustainable sources,
primarily renewables, and reducing emissions. on a country-by-country basis, the pace of this
change varies, making our, and our customers’, regulatory environment more complex and
increasing uncertainty about the extent of future regulations and policies. such changes could
lead to certain of our or our customers’ products, solutions and services becoming, subject to
gradualphase-outs, unlawful if we fail toadapttosuchchanges,orbecominguneconomical. for
example, in january 2020, germany decided to accelerate the phase-out of coal as a source for
primary energy generation. this decision may impact our service business for steam power plants
or may increase public pressure to also adapt related businesses. further countries in europe and
around the world have decided to exit coal power generation between 2025 and 2040 while
others have decided to stop building new coal power plants beyond such plants already in
construction, such as poland. moreover, more stringent emission thresholds, increased or
additional carbon pricing regulation or the discontinuance or reduction of current promotions
schemes,amongotherfactors,maymakecertainformsoffossilpowerproductionlessprofitable.
it cannot be ruled out that similar interventions may affect other business areas of our
generation division. for our industrial applications division, the business prospects may be
negatively impacted by the introduction of new taxes on fossil fuels. conversely, if government
interventions or regulations promoting hydrogen use (directly orindirectly) donotmaterialize as
expected,thebusinessprospectsofournewenergybusinessmaybenegativelyimpacted.
the business of our transmission division may be impacted by future eu legislation limiting or
banning the useofsf in gas-insulated switchgear. sf -basedgas-insulated switchgear contribute
6 6
a significant portion of our transmission division’s revenues and profit, and there can be no
assurance that our alternative solution is viable in the european market (see “3.2.2 we may be
unable to successfully develop and launch a portfolio of competitive and technologically-
advanced products, services and solutions, and our research and development efforts may be
unsuccessful.”). a ban of sf in the eu would also force us to shift production sites outside
6
europe to serve the unrestricted world market, which may adversely affect our reputation. in
addition, the development and certification of, potentially, further sf -free products and
6
manufacturing of a parallel product line would entail significant efforts and expenses.
furthermore, demand for our transmission products may suffer if the competent authorities
decide to reduce the fees grid operators may charge under applicable network regulations. in
addition, ongoing grid expansion projects may face resistance and be subject to legal actions
seeking to stop or delay the completion of one or more projects and may result in overcapacities
(see also “3.2.11 in connectionwith existing andpotential futurereorganizationandcost savings
measures, we may incur substantial restructuring expenses and cash outflows. we may not be
able to realize expected cost savings or we may fail to adjust our organizational and
manufacturing footprint in a timely manner or at all, and such reorganizations may not yield the
targeted benefits or may damage our reputation.”). our transmission business is particularly
sensitive to changes and the increase in standardization requirements concerning networks,
which may result in costly design changes and additional testing efforts. should we be unable to
implement the required changes to our products and solutions in a timely manner, we risk losing
marketaccessintheaffectedbusinessareas.
our sgre segment faces risks regarding the demand for its wind turbines due to regulatory and
policychangesinmanyjurisdictions.althoughthegeneralperceptionisthatthedecarbonization
46
trend will have a positive effect on the electricity production from renewables, including wind
energy, developers of wind power plants are dealing with the risk of industry specific policy
changes and increasing regulation and, in part, activism, mostly in the form of demonstrations
and protests, by the local population. these policy changes and regulations could be due to
renewable energy targets, environmental considerations (e.g., noise, minimum distances to
populated areas, bird protection), or technical requirements (e.g., regulations for grid
connections), but may also result from other factors such as the access to land for project
development, the overall permission process or subsidy rules. such measures could significantly
hinderthegrowthoftheonshoreandoffshorewindturbinemarket.
our sgre segment may also face local content requirements which may adversely impact our
operations in certain countries if such requirements were not met. in addition, various state
support measures, such as fixed feed-in tariffs and tax breaks, to promote the wind energy
market will be reduced or phased out, which may reduce sgre’s sales prices, revenues and
profitability. forexample,inchina,feed-intariffs foronshorewindenergyareexpectedtocease

in addition, the requirements for obtaining export credit insurances are becoming increasingly
stringent,whichmaynegativelyaffectsiemensenergy’sexportbusinessifsuchinsurancescannot
be obtained or can only be obtained at an additional cost. this is particularly relevant for coal-
firedpowerplants.
if there is a substantial adverse development in the regulatory and policy framework, this could
increase the costs and decrease future customer demand and this, in turn, could have a material
adverse effect on our competitive position and our business, financial position and results of
operations.
3.4.4 our risk management and internal controls may not prevent or detect compliance
risks, which could result in investigations by authorities, fines, damage claims,
payment claims, the termination of relationships with customers or suppliers and
even governmental exclusion from businesses (blacklisting) as well as reputational
damage. further, our internal controls could fail to detect business risks in time or at
all.
we operate in numerous countries with 89 thousand employees (in the fiscal year ended
september 30, 2019, average, based on headcount), including certain countries with less stable
political, legal and regulatory regimes as well as inconsistent enforcement of laws and
regulations. in addition, some of our customers and suppliers operate in countries which have
business environments, legal systems as well as political and cultural influences different from
those which prevail in western europe. we have only limited influence over the day-to-day
operations of our customers, suppliers and other partners. in particular, we have limited or no
insight on how our customers use the products we supply. all these circumstances inherently
createariskthatapplicablelegislationandregulationsmaybebreached.
wehaveimplementedacompliancesystemandorganization,haveestablishedacodeofconduct
and are providing regular training in order to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, e.g.,
anti-corruption, anti-bribery, antitrust, fair competition, anti-money laundering, data privacy,
humanrights,sanctionsandotherformsofexportcontrolregimes,includingcustomsregulations
and other legislation such as data protection regulations, regulatory security requirements or
capital markets laws. nevertheless, our existing compliance processes, systems and controls may
not be sufficient and our employees, customers, suppliers and other partners may not act in
compliance with applicable statutory provisions and internal guidelines or process descriptions,
for example, in procurement, production, proposals and sales. in particular, our projects are
often undertaken in high-risk countries where we are required to work with local project
partners,subcontractorsorsuppliers, whichwemaynotalwaysbeabletoanalyzeentirelyandin
all details. with regard to sanctions and other export control regimes, sanctioned parties may be
indirectly involved, makingitdifficult todetecttheirinvolvement.thehighpressurearisingfrom
a fast changing, more complex and aggressive business environment and aggressive target
47
setting may foster non-compliant behavior of our employees. we face the risk that, as a result of
any violations of relevant laws and regulations, penalties, liabilities, fines or investigations may
be imposed on us or that our business may be adversely affected. in addition, our compliance
system and monitoring capabilities may not be sufficient to promptly detect current compliance
issues, identify past violations or prevent damage from fraud or similar crimes in the group, as
has happened in the past in individual cases. furthermore, changes in applicable laws and
regulations, new guidance by competent authorities or interpretations of laws and regulations
bythecourtsposeadditionalchallengesforourcompliancesystems.forexample,thejudgement
of the european court of justice of july 16, 2020, which annulled the eu-us privacy shield, could
lead to additional costs for complying with new standards, or potential breaches of data privacy
rules,whichcouldresultinfines,reputationaldamageorothernegativeconsequencesforus.
for example, our sgre segment is currently investigating a number of possible compliance
violations relating to its indian subsidiary. to date, only violations of internal control regulations
have been identified, and it is not yet clear whether there have been any further compliance
violations and the extent of these violations. regarding our gas and power segment, we have
identified a business area that received, during a bidding process, confidential competitor and
customerinformation,whichmayhavenegativeconsequencesforus.
inappropriate behavior or any compliance breaches could lead to legal proceedings against us,
criminal, regulatory and/or other fines, sanctions, court orders affecting future conduct,
forfeiture of profits, rescission of existing contracts, exclusion from certain businesses (so-called
“blacklisting”), potential damages, loss of licenses and certifications or other restrictions, which,
in turn, might limit our ability to pursue strategic projects and transactions that may be
importantforourbusiness.
furthermore, while we have established an internal control system based on internationally
recognized industry standards, designed to help us achieve important business objectives and
sustain and improve business performance, there can be no assurance that this system will
effectivelydetectbusinessrisksintimeorinallcases.
involvement in potential non-compliance proceedings and investigations could harm our
reputation and that of our management, lead to the loss of customers and have a negative
impact on our brands and on our efforts to compete for new customers and new orders.
customers and/or third parties could also initiate legal proceedings against us for substantial
financialsums.
if our risk management or internal controls are not successful at preventing or detecting such
risks, we may be liable for fines, damage claims, payment claims and may suffer reputational
damage and the termination of relationships with customers or suppliers, each of which could
haveamaterialadverseeffectonourreputation,competitivepositionandourbusiness,financial
positionandresultsofoperations.
3.4.5 we may be unable to adequately protect and defend our ip and know-how or may
infringeonthird-partyiprights.
in close alignment with the product development process, we regularly apply for new patents
and actively manage our ip portfolio to maintain and enhance our technological position and to
support our business. there can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, preserve and
protect our ip rights will be completely adequate. this risk is further exacerbatedbythefact that
we have been pursuing a more selective strategy in recent years when filing for new patents,
whichisaimedatreducingcostswhileatthesametimeadequatelyprotectingourinnovations.
our ip rights may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages, particularly in
foreign jurisdictions where we have not invested in an ip portfolio or jurisdictions that do not
have strong ip rights or do not enforce such rights rigorously. the weakening of protection of
our trademarks, patents and other ip rights could also adversely affect our business. some of our
ip and know-how is not protected by registered ip rights, as we consider the disclosure of trade
secrets connected with a registration to be more harmful for us than the risk of secrecy
48
violations. therefore, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our
employees,butcannotguaranteethatsuchmeasureswillbeeffectivetoprotectourknow-how.
we are a party to a number of license agreements that afford us rights to ip that is necessary or
useful to our business, including licenses granted by siemens. our success depends in part on the
ability of us and our licensors to obtain, maintain and sufficiently enforce our ip rights, as well as
licensed ip rights, we have commercialized. without protection for the ip rights we have filed
with the respective patent office and license, other companies might be able to offer
substantially identical products, which could adversely affect sales of our products and,
ultimately, of our competitive position. also, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
obtain or renew from third parties the licenses to ip rights we needin thefuture, andthereis no
assurancethatsuchlicensescanbeobtainedonreasonableterms.
our products are proprietary developments but their basic designs sometimes resemble
competingproducts.although,weimplementedprocessesdesignedtopreventthatourproducts
or parts thereof unintentionally infringe ip rights of third parties (in particular patents,
trademarks and design rights), there can be no guarantee that our prevention mechanisms will
detect infringements in time or at all. if we infringe third-party rights, we may be liable for
damages as well as litigation costs and may have to withdraw goods already produced from the
marketorpurchasealicensetousesuchrights.
if protections for our ip prove inadequate, if we are unable to successfully defend and enforce
our ip rights and confidentiality agreements, or if we infringe third-party ip rights, this may have
amaterialadverseeffectonourbusiness,financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
3.4.6 we are subject to environmental, health and safety as well as other regulatory
requirements and risks, as a result of which we may incur significant costs, liabilities
andobligations.
the majority of the industries in which we operate are highly regulated. for example, certain of
our, or our suppliers’, production processes require, and certain of our products contain,
chemicals or other substances which are subject to various laws and regulations, and we have to
adhere to stringent occupational health and safety laws and regulations not only in our
production facilities but also, among others, on project sites and at customer locations. current
and future ehs and other governmental regulations, or changes thereto, may require us to
change the way we run our operations and could result in significant increases in our operating
orproductioncosts.furthermore,duetothehighriskprofileofsomeofourworkweseetherisk
of potential ehs incidents as well as potential non-compliance with ehs regulations affecting
siemens energy and our contractors or sub-suppliers, resulting for example in serious injuries,
penalties, loss of reputation and internal or external investigations as well as project delays.
especially in emerging market environments with a less mature culture in relation to ehs there
maybeariskofseriousand/orfatalaccidents.
in addition, while we have procedures in place to ensure compliance with applicable
governmental regulations in the conduct of our business operations, violations of applicable
governmental regulations either by us or by third parties that we contract with, including
consortium partners, suppliers or service providers whose activities may be attributed to us, may
not be fully excluded. any such violations particularly expose us to the risk of liability, penalties,
fines, reputational damage or loss of licenses or permits that are important to our business
operations. we could also face liability for damage or remediation for environmental
contamination at the facilities we own, lease, design or operate. this risk is further exacerbated
by the fact that much of the real estate used by siemens energy was acquired when such real
estate had already been in industrial use. siemens energy, thus, cannot guarantee that such real
estate was always operated in line with ehs regulations, but may, nevertheless, be held
responsible for the consequences of a failure to do so. with regard to certain environmental
risks, we maintain liability insurance. we may incur environmental losses beyond the insurance
limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance, and such losses may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. risks in relation to ehs may
49
be exacerbated in cases where we are, either due to a lack of adequate and experienced
contractors, preferences by our consortium partners or customers for specific contractors, forced
to work with contractors with no or inadequate ehs experience on construction sites. in such
cases,wemaynotbeabletoupholdourownehsstandardapproachandpractices.furthermore,
we may have to allocate additional resources or incur additional costs to align our ehs standard
approachandpracticeswiththatofourcontractors.
furthermore, due to our global operations, we have a large number of employees in many
different jurisdictions with different, sometimes conflicting, ehs standards, which makes
compliance with these standards more complex. furthermore, it cannot be excluded that in
individual cases, certain employees may have insufficient knowledge about binding international
and local requirements in this field. we may also be inadequately prepared to respond to
unexpected regulatory enforcement actions. increasingly, compliance and enforcement of ehs
standardisbecomingpartoffinancingtermsforprojects, andwemayfailtoaccuratelyinterpret
andapplythesestandards,whichmayjeopardizethefinancingofourprojects.
3.4.7 ourinsurancecoveragemaynotbesufficientandinsurancepremiumsmayincrease.
we maintain insurance coverage in relation to a number of risks associated with our business
activities, including third-party (product) liability, property damage and business interruption,
environmental damage, directors and officers liability, construction, transport and vehicle
insurance. these insurance policies may not cover all losses or damages resulting from the
materialization of any of the risks. there can moreover be no assurance that our insurance
providers will continue to grant coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at all. in addition,
there are risks left intentionally uninsured, and we, therefore, have no insurance against these
events. furthermore, agreed limits and other restrictions (e.g., exclusions) within the insurance
coverage may prove to be too low or inadequate for compensating potential damages or losses,
ultimately resulting in a gap in the insurance coverage. if we sustain damages for which there is
no or insufficient insurance coverage, or if we have to pay higher insurance premiums or
encounter restrictions on insurance coverage, this may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position and results of operations. the risk of obtaining insurance coverage
could become more costly given changing market conditions due to high profile cases in the
recentpastandtheeconomicdownturn.
3.4.8 our tax burden could increase due to changes in tax laws and regulations or their
application or interpretation, as a result of current or future tax audits, or transfer
pricingadjustments.
we operate in nearly all countries of the world and therefore are subject to many different tax
regulations. our tax burden could increase due to changes in tax laws or their application or
interpretation, or as a result of current or future tax audits. changes in tax laws or regulations,
tax treaties or any change in position by the relevant authorities regarding the application,
administration and interpretation (including any form of administrative guidance or through the
interpretation by courts) in any applicable jurisdiction, could result in higher tax expenses and
increased tax payments (prospectively or retrospectively). furthermore, these changes could
particularly impact our tax receivables and tax liabilities as well as deferred tax assets and
deferred tax liabilities. in addition, the uncertain legal environment in some regions could limit
our ability to enforce our rights. as a globally operating organization, we conduct business in
countries subject to complex tax rules, which may be interpreted in different ways. furthermore,
changes in fiscal regulations or in the interpretation of tax laws by the courts as well as future
changes in interpretations or developments of tax regimes bythetaxauthorities mayalso havea
material adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition, cash flows and results of
operations.
we are regularly audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions and we continuously identify
and assess relevant risks, and an assessment of the relevant tax authorities could lead to
additional tax burdens or other detrimental consequences. siemens gas and power gmbh & co.
kg (to be renamed siemens energy global gmbh & co. kg, “se global gmbh & co. kg”) as well
50
as the german and other foreign subsidiaries belonging to the siemens energy group are or will
likely be subject to tax audits by the respective tax authorities on a regular basis. for instance,
the mexico division of our sgre segment is subject to tax audits for the fiscal years 2013 and
2014. additionally, the india division is subject to audits for the fiscal years 2010/2011 through
2017/2018 and a philippine subsidiary is subject to a tax audit relating to the year 2018.
furthermore, some of the siemens energy group entities are involved in pending tax disputes
with local tax authorities in several jurisdictions. as a result of current or future tax audits or
other reviews by the tax authorities or tax disputes, material additional taxes could be imposed
on our siemens energy group companies exceeding the provisions reflected in our financial
statements. for instance, the original treatment of a tax-relevant matter in a tax return, tax
assessment or otherwise could later be found incorrect, the validity of our tax groups for past
and current periods could be challenged, and additional taxes, interest, penalty payments and/or
social security payments could be assessed on any of our companies. such (re-)assessment may be
due to an interpretation or view of laws and/or facts by tax authorities in a manner deviating
from our view and may in particular emerge as a result of tax audits or other review actions by
the relevant tax authorities or tax disputes pending before the tax courts. for instance, several
tax disputes of the brazilian siemens energy group companies are pending before the brazilian
tax courts. this could lead to a significant increase in our tax obligations, either as a result of the
relevant tax payment being assessed directly against us or as the result of us becoming liable for
the relevant tax as a secondary obligor due to the primary obligor’s (such as, for example, an
employee) failure to pay. some companies of our siemens energy group have been and are still
significantly benefitting from a preferential tax treatment, such as the preferential tax status of
certain of our chinese subsidiaries which, under chinese tax law, are classified as “high and new
technology enterprise” (hnte) and thus are eligible for a lower income tax rate. if a preferential
taxtreatmentwasdeniedwithretroactiveeffectorisnolongergrantedinthefuture,thiswould
have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. several of our
subsidiaries have considerable tax loss carry forwards, some of which have been capitalized as
deferred tax assets in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending on
september 30, 2019. the utilization of tax loss carry forwards, however, may be restricted under
applicable tax laws, for instance, if they cannot be carried forward indefinitely or if they forfeit
upon occurrence of a certain events (e.g., a direct or indirect transfer of shares or a change of
control). if tax loss carry forwards can no longer be set-off against future taxable profits, this
wouldgenerallyincreaseourfuturetaxburden(forfurtherdetailswithrespecttotheseparation
see“3.5.13intheseparationfromsiemensgroupandinparticularinthespin-off,unutilizedtax
loss carry forwards and interest carry forwards could have been forfeited.” below). in addition,
any such restriction may require a write-down of the deferred tax assets in our consolidated
financialstatements.thiswouldnegativelyaffectourfinancialpositionandresultsofoperations.
because we operate in numerous jurisdictions, we are exposed to tax risks, in particular with
regard to the so-called “transfer pricing” rules that apply in several jurisdictions and in relation
to cross-border business relationships. pursuant to such rules, related enterprises are obligated to
conduct any inter-company transactions per conditions which would also apply among unrelated
third parties concluding comparable agreements (so-called “at arm’s length principle”) and to
provide sufficient documentation thereof, subject to the rules applicable to them in the relevant
jurisdiction. even though we have established a transfer pricing model aimed at being compliant
with domestic and international transfer pricing regulations, it cannot be excluded that one or
moreforeigntaxauthoritiesmightnotagreewith,andthuschallenge,ourimplementedtransfer
pricing rules. the consequence might be double taxation in two or more countries, which could
potentially only be mitigated or avoided by means of a mutual agreement procedure between
the relevant tax authorities or certain unilateral measures. furthermore, transfer pricing risks
may increase in the future as intra-group cross-border business grows or changes against the
background of the digitalization and as the tax authorities’ interpretation of the arm’s length
principle evolves over time. for example, some of our subsidiaries sell goods and/or provide
services to foreign subsidiaries. these companies must fulfill special requirements regarding the
documentation of transfer prices according to special tax laws, such as the german foreign tax
act (außensteuergesetz) or similar applicable national laws and regulations regarding oecd

requirements. our documentation may be considered to be insufficient by the relevant tax
authorities or transfer prices may be considered to be inadequate or inadequately justified. this
may result in penalties and additional tax payments. companies of our group could be involved
in transactions with the existing shareholders of the company and/or parties related to the
existing shareholders. such transactions, in order to be recognized for income tax purposes, also
need to comply with the arm’s length principle. in case of any such transactions being found not
to be at arm’s length, this could lead to the assessment of additional taxespayablebycompanies
of our group and thus negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial
position.
3.4.9 we depend, with respect to certain activities, on permits, licenses, approvals,
certifications and exemptions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to
renew all necessary licenses, certifications and similar permits required for our
operationsinatimelymanner.
certain of our activities depend on permits, licenses, approvals, certifications and/or exemptions
in different jurisdictions in order to operate our business. for example, we are exposed to risks
associated with approvals when building and operating production facilities and require certain
certifications for our plants, which must be regularly renewed. furthermore, our customers
increasinglyrequirethatweobtainadditionalcertificationsinordertoconsiderengagingus.the
necessary validation and certification processes are often complex, time-consuming and costly,
and may be influenced by factors that are beyond our control. also, occupational health and
safetyincidentsmaycausecertaincertifications tobesuspendedorrevoked.inaddition,relevant
regulatory authorities may not grant licenses, approvals, certifications, exemptions and
dispensationsasquicklyasanticipated,whichmayresultinprojectdelaysorunusedcapacities. in
addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our permits, licenses,
approvals, certifications, exemptions and dispensations upon their expiration within the required
timeframeoratall.
with respect to our sgre segment, the governmental support for the wind industry in the form
of subsidies and similar schemes (see “3.1.8 the wind power industry faces structural market
changes, in particular declining subsidy levels, and there can be no guarantee that siemens
gamesa renewable energy will succeed in addressing the resulting challenges.”), and the
granting of permits and licenses for the operation of wind power plants (including in relation to
a wind power plant’s construction, environmental impact, grid connection and feeding-in of
power) currently constitute an important form of governmental and administrative support for
investments in the wind power industry. any decrease or elimination of such (indirect)
government support in any jurisdiction, including political or policy changes towards the wind
industry and/or in relation to the cost, timing and conditions required to obtain permits and
licenses for wind power plants (such as statutory minimum distances between wind power plants
and populated areas), could have a negative impact on the market for wind power in that
jurisdiction and, consequently, could reduce the demand for our sgre segment’s wind power
equipmentanditsrevenuesfromsales.
if we are unable to secure permits, licenses, approvals, certifications and exemptions, our
activities may be disrupted and this could have a material adverse effect on our competitive
positionandourbusiness,financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
3.4.10 we are subject to risks relating to change-of-control clauses, which may result in
termination or in renegotiation of contracts, potentially with less advantageous
terms for us. such change-of-control clauses may be triggered when the spin-off
becomeseffectiveandwemaynotalwaysbeabletoobtainawaiver,amendmentor
novation.
several agreements entered into by siemens energy contain change-of-control clauses. in case of
a change of control, any of the parties is entitled to terminate the relevant agreement. these
types of provisions apply to certain agreements entered into between siemens energy with third
parties or with siemens ag, including the preferred financing agreements with siemens,
licensing agreements pursuant to which we are entitled to use the “siemens” brand (see
52
“3.5.11undercertain conditions, we maylose theright tousethe“siemensenergy”or“siemens
gamesa”brands,whichcouldleaveuswithoutaconsistentbrandacrossourbusinessactivities or
entirely without an established brand.” below), an agreement regarding a strategic alliance
between the parties, covering also the supply of siemens products to our sgre segment,
agreements for the contracting of financial derivatives between both companies. furthermore,
siemens has a right to request the sale back of certain ip relating to our power plants control
system sppa-t3000 which has been transferred by siemens to siemens energy if a third party
directly or indirectly acquires control over siemens energy. additionally, in case of a change of
control event, our sgre segment may have to pay significantly higher fees for guarantees issued
inthefavorofitscustomers.
certain contracts of siemens energy made with consortium partners, suppliers, customers and
other contractual partners include change of control provisions allowing for termination, in
particular if thenewcontrolling partyis theotherparty’s competitor. afterspin-off completion,
siemens ag will no longer be the majority shareholder of siemens energy. this may trigger the
change-of-control clauses in certain contracts. while we have approached consortium partners,
suppliers, customers and other contractual partners with contracts containing a
change-of-control clause, it is uncertain whether and which contract partners will make use of
their rights, which may result in loss of contracts, an obligation of siemens energy to find
alternative suppliers and partners, potentially at a higher cost, or develop appropriate in-house
functions.
specific provisions regarding a change of control are for example contained in the ip agreement
between siemens ag and rolls-royce plc relating to our aero-derivative gas turbine business.
once this agreement is transferred to siemens energy a provision will apply to us, according to
which, if a competitor of rolls-royce plc. acquires direct or indirect control of siemens energy
(whereby the acquisition of 30% of siemens energy’s shares implies the acquisition of control),
siemens energy is obligated to sell the aero-derivative gas turbine business to a company that is
not a competitor of rolls-royce within 12 months of such acquisition of control. if the business is
notsold,thelicensesgrantedbyrolls-roycetosiemensenergywillbeautomaticallyterminated.
3.5 risks related to our separation from the siemens group
3.5.1 our gas and power segment and, to a lesser extent, our sgre segment may lose
business opportunities and face a negative perception of our stand-alone position
following our separation from the siemens group. further, as a stand-alone group,
we may not be able to satisfy financial or technical requirements under public
procurementlaws.
in the past, our gas and power segment benefited to some extent from the business activities of
the siemens group, and vice versa, in particular regarding the sale of our transmission products
bysiemens’“smartinfrastructure”segment.itcannotberuledoutthat,followingthesignificant
reduction of siemens’ stake in siemens energy ag following the spin-off, we will no longer
benefitfromthiscooperationasmuchasweusedto.wemayalsolosebusinessopportunitieswe
previously enjoyed because our business partners took into consideration other business
opportunities relating to the entire siemens group when they entered into business relations
withus.wealsofacetheriskthatacontractualpartnermaynotagreetotransferacontractora
binding offer (entered into or submitted prior to our separation from siemens) from siemens to
siemens energy. in such case, we may have to execute on such contracts as a sub-contractor or
agent of siemens. this situation could result in losing contractual partners and/or business
opportunities if contractual partners are then unwilling to continue their relationship with
siemens energy. as such transfers usually require the consent ofthecounterparty, counterparties
such as customers or suppliers may use the consent requirement as leverage to enter into
renegotiations or make use of their contractual termination rights. similarly, objections to
contract transfers could also cause us to lose access to current or future ip rights which were
licensedtosiemensandmayresultinrestrictedaccesstocertainbusinessfields.
53
we face the risk that the new stand-alone position of siemens energy may be negatively
perceived by potential consortium partners, suppliers, customers and their lenders, employees
and other stakeholders. for example, customers of siemens’ former gas and power business may
bereluctanttoplaceorderswithsiemensenergy,e.g.,becauseofalessfavorablecreditratingor
insufficient capabilities to finance projects, or we may experience increased difficulties to recruit
and to retain talent and key experts. to a lesser degree, this risk is also relevant for our sgre
segment,especiallywithaviewtooffshoreprojects.
furthermore, private-sector clients or public procurement laws often require that a bidder
demonstrates certain qualifications, e.g., by demonstrating that the bidder has been active with
a registered local company for a certain number of years, sufficient capitalization, or technical
qualifications, e.g., by demonstrating a track record of relevant projects. while siemens has
permitted us using references of projects we executed as part of siemens group, there can be no
assurance siemens will cooperate in relation to such references projects or that public authorities
will accept such references as references demonstrating our capabilities as a stand-alone
company.
3.5.2 we may face difficulties in satisfying certain treasury and finance requirements as
well as performing certain services and functions that historically were provided by
thesiemensgroup.
as our gas and power segment had formerly been a fully-integrated part of the siemens group,
we have relied on financial, administrative and other resources (such as services related, for
example, to taxes, legal and contract management, it, corporate communications, procurement,
human resources, internal audit, compliance, real estate, (cyber-)security, accounting and
financing, including treasury, guarantees, insurance and pension management) of the siemens
group.followingthespin-off,thesiemensgroupwillcontinuetoprovidesomeoftheseservices
and function-related services for a limited period of time under transitional service agreements
as well as under long-term service agreements and other individually negotiated agreements.
such service agreements will, however, not replace these services to the same extent, or may not
function as efficiently, or may not fully capture the organizational and commercial benefits the
group’s business has enjoyed as a fully-integrated part of the siemens group. it is also possible
that such service agreements may be insufficient to cover our future needs. for example,
accounting complexities resulting from our separation from siemens are expected to make our
futurefinancialreportingsignificantlymorecomplex,andwemaynotbeabletoensureaccurate
and timely reporting of our financial results. further, the transitional and long-term service
agreements may contain terms and conditions that may prove to be unfavorable. in addition, if
the siemens group fails to perform the services provided for under the various service
agreements, this may result in operational problems or liabilities towards third parties and
increased costs for us. furthermore, if, after the expiration or termination of the transitional
service agreements, we fail to set up the relevant functions by ourselves or to replace the
transitional services with third-party services in a timely manner or on reasonable terms, we may
experience operational problems, become liable towards third parties and incur increased costs.
to a lesser degree, sgre could also be affected as it also has transitional services agreements in
placewiththesiemensgroup.
moreover, due to cost reasons, long-term (currency) hedges are expected to be replaced with
short-term hedgesresulting inahigherriskexposure.inconnectionwiththespin-off, significant
hedging positions will be transferred to siemens energy, which could be more costly than
anticipated. in case of a termination of the existing hedging positions, the market values of the
derivative transactions need to be settled between the relevant parties which could result in
substantialshort-termpaymentobligationsofsiemensenergy.
after our separation from siemens, we may not be able to continue to rely on certain waivers
and exemptions granted under capital markets regulations, including under the european
union’s european market infrastructure regulation (emir), to pursue derivatives trading,
clearing and collateralization as well as for certain treasury financing operations of non-financial
companies for both group-internal and external activities without having to obtain a license. if
54
we fail to obtain required waivers and exemptions in time or at all we may be required to set-up
systemsforexternalreportingorhavetoprocureservicesexternallyatincreasedcosts.
in particular, with respect to our working capital requirements and capital for our general
corporate purposes – including acquisitions, research and development and capital expenditures
– the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency denominated receivables, payables,
debt, guarantees, firm commitments and forecast transactions, as well as interest rate change
risks, credit risks associated with contractual partners (e.g., banks and customers) and market
price risks (e.g., commodities or foreign exchange) have all historically been managed by or via
the siemens group. other corporate finance and treasury services (including insurance and
pension management services) have historically been managed as part of the treasury and
financing policies and procedures of the siemens group. following the spin-off, our corporate
finance and treasury functions will continue to depend on the siemens group for certain finance
and treasury it tools for a transitional period of 8 to 24 months and potentially beyond. upon
expiration of such support service agreements (or if we decide to terminate them or they are
terminated upon notice by siemens), there can be no guarantee that we will be able to replace
such tools in a timely and cost-efficient manner, which could negatively impact our business
operationsandresults.
there is a risk that guarantees attributable to the siemens energy business contain rating trigger
clauses which oblige siemens energy (in case of transferred contracts) to replace such guarantees
through alternative securities, e.g., bank guarantees or surety bonds, in case the rating of the
guarantor falls below a defined level. furthermore, fees for existing or new guarantees, surety
exposures or parent company guarantees may increase significantly, especially for guarantees
relating to long-term service contracts. in an unfavorable financial markets environment such
feesmayrisedisproportionatelyforsiemensenergywhencomparedtosiemens.
in the stand-alone set-up following the spin-off, we intend to obtain financing from banks,
public offerings or private placements of debt, convertible or potentially equity securities. the
cost of obtaining third-party funding for our business could be higher than under the financing
received from the siemens group prior to the separation. in addition, third-party providers of
debt financing, such as banks, may not be willing or, due to internal thresholds or other
limitations, able to provide or extend credits or other forms of debt financing to us in the first
months after spin-off because they have already provided similar financing to other entities of
the siemens group and it may take time to adjust credit lines and transfer such exposures. while
our sgre segment is mostly financing itself, sgre and other siemens energy group companies
form a so-called “single borrower unit” (kreditnehmereinheit) (see “3.3.4 our business and the
businesses of our customers and suppliers require access to significant credit and guarantee lines
and other financing instruments. our business activities could be negatively affected if we are
unable to meet our capital requirements in the future, for example in weak financial market
environments, as a result of a significant deterioration of our credit standing or of a breach of a
credit facility agreement, or if access to capital becomes more expensive. our business activities
could be similarly negatively affected if our customers or suppliers do not have access to
financingoneconomicallyviableterms.”).thesameappliestoanyotherkindofproductwemay
decide to, or be required to, purchase or obtain from banks, insurance companies or other third
parties (e.g., hedging instruments or guarantees). furthermore, we cannot rule out that our
credit rating may be negatively impacted if sgre s.a.’s ratings were subject to a downgrading,
andviceversa.
3.5.3 wearesubjecttotaxrisksduetotheseparationfromthesiemensgroup
the separation from the siemens group and the grouping of activities and assets that shall form
part of the siemens energy group was implemented by way of reorganization measures under
german law (e.g., spin-off) and comparable measures under the laws of other jurisdictions as
well as certain carve-out measures. in the course of these separation measures, a multitude of
assets have been transferred. in addition, numerous contractual intercompany relations between
siemens and siemens energy (for instance, financing arrangements) had to be terminated,
sometimes prematurely and/or against the payment of an arms’ length termination fee. in this
55
respect, it cannot be ruled out that the envisaged tax treatment of such measures will be
challenged by the tax authorities and that additional taxes, for instance, income taxes, vat,
stamp duties or de-grouping charges, will be assessed, for example due to a denial of certain
exemptions or of input vat-deductions, or a different valuation of the transferred assets, orthat
loss-carry-forwards will be utilized as a consequence of such measures which could result in a
reductionofdeferredtaxassets.
asageneralrule,thetaxesarisinginthecourseoftheseparationofthesiemensenergybusiness
shallbebornebytheentitywhichowessuchtaxesasstatutorytaxpayer.hence,e.g.,intheevent
that the siemens energy business was separated by way of reverse carve-out measures, the tax
burdenandriskswhichresultfromsuchmeasureorrelatetothecarvedoutbusinessremainwith
entities of the siemens energy group, although the transferred assets do not belong to the
siemensenergybusiness.
furthermore, under the group separation agreement (konzerntrennungsvertrag), siemens
energy ag shall procure that certain assets contributed to se global gmbh & co. kg are
recognizedattheir taxbookvaluesandtherequiredapplication with thecompetenttaxofficeis
filed in time. if siemens energy ag violates such obligations and taxes are imposed on siemens
ag or siemens beteiligungen inland gmbh (“sbi gmbh”), both of which hold shares in the
company, or their loss carry forwards for corporate income and trade tax purposes are reduced,
siemens energy ag shall compensate siemens ag or sbi gmbh. sbi gmbh has also contributed a
limited partnership interest (kommanditanteil) in se global gmbh & co. kg to siemens energy
ag in return for granting shares in siemens energy ag. in this regard, siemens energy ag is
obligated to recognize this partnership interest at tax book value and to file the required
application with the competent tax office in time. if these obligations are violated, siemens
energy ag is liable towards siemens ag or sbi gmbh if taxes are imposed on them or their loss
carry forwards for corporate income tax purposes are reduced. the group separation agreement
further contains provisions in relation tosharesheldbysiemens agorsbi gmbhthataresubject
to a lock-up period (sperrfristbehaftete anteile) for tax purposes in connection with the
separation of the siemens energy business. if a contribution gain (einbringungsgewinn) is
assessed, the tax consequences at thelevel ofsiemens agandsbi gmbhtogetherwith thetrade
tax arising at the level of se global gmbh & co. kg may result in a total cash-out of up to a
mediumthreedigitmillioneuroamount.suchtaxcash-outmaybecompensatedonlypartiallyby
corresponding tax benefits, for which the cash effect may only arise over time. in case siemens
energy ag caused such assessment of the contribution gain (e.g., by violating the obligation to
procure that siemens energy entities apply for tax book values or by triggering an event
pursuant to section 22 (1) sentence 6 of the german transformation tax act
(umwandlungssteuergesetz)), siemens energy ag shall compensate siemens ag or sbi gmbh for
the resulting tax consequences. in case such contribution gain is caused by siemens ag or sbi
gmbh, siemens energy ag may have a compensation claim against siemens ag for trade tax or
the reduction of trade tax loss carry-forwards resulting therefrom, whereas such claim is
generally reduced by potential tax benefits arising for siemens energy ag and/or se global
gmbh & co. kg in case of a recognition of an increase amount in accordance with section 23 (2)
of the german transformation tax act (umwandlungssteuergesetz) (“step-up”). to the extent
that the potential step-up benefit exceeds the amount, which siemens ag would have to pay to
siemens energy ag without the deduction of the step-up benefit, siemens energy ag is obliged
to pay to siemens ag an amount equal to this difference, even though the step-up benefit may
not have materialized in a cash effect yet, but only would materialize over time. finally, the
parties of the group separation agreement (konzerntrennungsvertrag) shall cooperate with
regard to tax matters and in case one party does not comply with its cooperation obligations, it
has to indemnify the other party, i.e., if siemens energy ag is not compliant it has to indemnify
siemensagortheaffectedsiemensgroupentity.
for a transitional period, there may also be tax inefficiencies associated with the need to initially
set-up the corporate and/or business structure (including, among others, the conclusion or
transfer of customer contracts) and with the transfer of assets in certain jurisdictions. there are,
for instance, jurisdictions in which the siemens energy group will operate via newly created
56
permanent establishments which need to become registered for tax and, as the case may be,
particularly vat purposes. such process usually takes some time and, might be further delayed,
duetoexternalconditions(suchasthecurrentcovid-19pandemic).
3.5.4 we have not previously operated as a stand-alone publicly listed entity and the
spin-off may result in significant additional expenses; we may be unable to operate
efficientlyandtofullyimplementourbusinessstrategy.
we have not previously operated as a stand-alone publicly listed entity and it is uncertain how
we will perform as such. following spin-off completion, we will be responsible for managing all
of our corporate affairs ourselves. this may result in significant additional expenses, including
expenses for the creation of our own financial and administrative support systems and for
services that will continue to be provided by the siemens group to us pursuant to transitional
service agreements at prices intended to correspond to those obtainable from third parties, and/
or expose the company to an increased risk of legal, regulatory or civil costs or penalties.
furthermore, suchtransitional service agreementswithsiemensandotheragreementsqualifying
asrelated-partytransactions, inparticularagreementsthatincludevolumecommitments, bindus

separation from siemens if prices for the procured services change in the market. conversely, we
agreed on a general volume discount for the service contracts with siemens relating to our gas
and power segment. for example, for certain specified worldwide services, siemens ag shall
grant a mid double digit percentage discount on the agreed prices in the first year after the
spin-off completion (i.e., presumably until september 25, 2021), a low double digit percentage
discount in the second and third year; thereafter, no further discounts shall be granted. for
purposes of our internal planning, we have assumed to benefit from these volume discounts to
thefullextent.accordingly,ifwefailtoobtainthesediscounts,thecostsforservicesobtainedby
siemenswouldbesignificantlyhigherthananticipated.
significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and financial risk
management and business operations as a result of operating as a stand-alone publicly listed
entity separate from the siemens group. the historical financial information in the form of
combined financial statements included in this prospectus relate to periods prior to our
separation from siemens and, thus, may not fully reflect the additional costs of us operating as
an independent company (see “3.5.5 our combined financial statements are based on
management judgments and a series of assumptions and estimates that may prove inaccurate
and not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone
publicly listed company.”). furthermore, we anticipate that our success in managing our business
as a stand-alone publicly listed entity and in successfully implementing our business strategy will
depend substantially upon our ability to develop the expertise necessary to comply with the
numerous regulatory and other requirements applicable to independent public companies. in
addition, we will need to implement or adapt and monitor the necessary structures including an
effective internal control environment. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in a
timely and effective manner and may face additional costs in doing so, which could have a
materialadverseeffectonourbusiness,financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
we may be unable to realize the potential benefits associated with the separation from siemens
as and when we expect. these benefits include our ability to focus on our own strategic and
operational plans, cost savings from a lean and efficient company setup, a more efficient
allocation of capital and a distinct investment identity which allows investors to evaluate our
merits, performance and future prospects separately from those of the siemens group. we may
not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among
others, increased costs and liabilities when operating as a stand-alone company, the necessity to
set up independent functions and processes and we may be more susceptible to market
fluctuations and other adverse events than if we were still a fully-integrated part of the siemens
group,sinceourbusinesswillbesignificantlylessdiversified.
57
3.5.5 our combined financial statements are based on management judgments and a
series of assumptions and estimates that may prove inaccurate and not necessarily
representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone publicly listed
company.
we have no history of operating as a stand-alone company. the historical financial information
included in this prospectus does not necessarily indicate what our group’s results of operations,
financial position, cash flows or costs and expenses will be in the future. such historical financial
information has been derived from siemens group’s historical financial and company
information, with certain adjustments being made. in order to reflect the assets, liabilities,
income and expenses that fall within the scope of the siemens energy group, various
combination rules as well as a series of assumptions and estimates have been applied. the
management of siemens energy exercised considerable judgment in determining these
combinationrules,assumptionsandestimates.
in addition, some of our subsidiaries were in the past part of the siemens income tax group
(hereinafter referred to as the “siemens tax group”) such that certain taxes were not imposed
on us. for purposes of the preparation of our combined financial statements, we have
disregardedthesiemenstaxgroupandcalculatedincomebasedoncertainassumptions.
therefore, the historical financial information contained in the prospectus in the form of
combined financial statements does not necessarily reflect the financial position, results of
operations and/or cash flows that we would have had if siemens energy group had existed as a
separategroupintheperiodspresented.
3.5.6 as a legal consequence of the spin-off, creditors of siemens ag may be able to
enforce certain claims existing at the time of the spin-off against us, and there can
benoassurancethatweareabletoobtainindemnificationfromsiemensag.
our separation from siemens was partly realized by way of a spin-off under the german
transformation act (umwandlungsgesetz) or comparable corporate measures under the laws of
other jurisdictions. under relevant laws, we may be held liable by creditors of siemens ag who
maybeabletoenforcecertainclaimsexistingatthetimeofthespin-offagainstus.forexample,
in accordance with the provisions of the german transformation act, siemens energy ag is
jointly and severally liable with siemens ag for any liabilities of siemens ag that were incurred
prior to spin-off completion if such liabilities fall due within five years, or in case of retirement
benefit obligations under the german company pension act (betriebsrentengesetz) ten years,
from publication of the spin-off in the commercial registers of siemens ag. in the spin-off and
transfer agreement concluded between siemens ag and siemens energy ag, siemens ag agreed
toindemnifysiemensenergyagagainstanyliabilitiesorobligationsthatremainedwithsiemens
ag in the event that relevant claims are asserted against siemens energy ag. should siemens ag
not satisfy its obligations to indemnify siemens energy ag, this could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or prospects. furthermore,
existing creditors of siemens ag could request siemens energy ag to provide security to the
extent such creditors cannot obtain satisfaction of their claims and can demonstrate probable
causethatthefulfillmentoftheirclaimswillbejeopardizedbythespin-off.
3.5.7 we are exposed to risks arising from indemnities which we have granted to siemens
in connection with our separation from siemens. in addition, as part of this
separation, assets or liabilities may have been incorrectly allocated, which may
requireustotransfercertainassetstoorassumefurtherliabilitiesfromsiemens.

can be held liable for obligations or that it is affected by other consequences from former
activities attributable to the transferred siemens energy business. it has therefore been agreed
that siemens energy will indemnify the relevant local future siemens companies from liabilities
58
attributable to the transferred siemens energy business. these indemnity obligations could have
amaterialadverseeffectonourbusiness,financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that we have, as part of our separation from siemens,
erroneously received assets or liabilities attributable to siemens group. conversely, assets or
liabilities attributable to siemens energy may have remained with siemens. if such erroneous
transfers of assets or liabilities or failures to transfer assets or liabilities are established, we may
berequiredtotransferassetstoorassumeliabilitiesfromsiemens.
3.5.8 as we build our it environment and transition our data to our own systems, we
couldincursubstantialadditionalcostsandmaysuffertemporarilyreducedqualityof
itservicesorbusinessinterruptions.
after spin-off completion, a large part of our it environment, including infrastructure, systems,
applications and related support and development functions will continue to be highly
integrated and embedded in siemens group’s it environment. siemens group will therefore
continue to provide certain it services to us, including infrastructure services, license services,
systems and application services. however, we will also continue to install and implement our
own it environment to support our critical business functions. in particular, we will transition or
newly introduce the it systems for the group including financial consolidation and reporting
systems, treasury, guarantee as well as insurance administration systems, central customer
relationship solutions, compliance, export control, customs and tax systems. we may incur
temporary interruptions in business operations and financing services if we cannot transition
effectively from siemens group’s existing transactional and operational systems and data centers
and the services that support these functions as we replace these systems with our own. we may
not be successful in effectively and efficiently implementing our new systems and transitioning
our data and we may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently
anticipated. any interruptions as we implement the new systems and replace parts of the
siemensgroup’sitservices,orourfailuretoimplementthenewsystemsandreplacethesiemens
group’s services effectively and efficiently, could disrupt our business and expose us to liability
towards third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations. in addition, we may incur proportionally higher costs than
planned for our it, as central or corporate it systems and services are provided to a smaller base
(e.g., the costs for software licenses as well as support and maintenance contracts proportionally
increases, as we cease to benefit from lower prices currently available due to larger volume
purchasingaspartofsiemensgroup).
3.5.9 asastand-aloneentity,ourgasandpowersegmentand,toalesserextent,oursgre
segment may be unable to continue benefiting from joint purchasing and
procurementtermswithsiemensaginthefuture.
our gas and power segment has until recently been an integral part of siemens and thus
benefited significantly from siemens’ purchasing and bargaining power in procuring goods,
technology, financing (including guarantees, hedges, letters of credit and other bank services),
logistics and other services (including insurance, pension plans, legal and audit and it services).
following the spin-off completion, we will be a smaller and less diversified company than
siemens. as a separate, stand-alone company, we may be unable to obtain goods, technology
andservices atprices andontermsasfavorableasthoseavailabletoourgasandpowersegment
and, to a lesser extent, our sgre segment prior to the separation from the siemens group. in
order to continue to benefit from joint purchasing and procurement terms, siemens energy and
siemens ag entered into joint pooling agreements regarding our gas and power and our sgre
segment, respectively. under these agreements, siemens ag acts for siemens energy on the
procurement markets in respect of certain materials. after expiry or termination of the joint
pooling agreements, we may fail to enter into individual agreements on similar or other
favorable terms in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financialpositionandresultsofoperations.

localmarkets,establishedfacilities,researchanddevelopmentresourcesmayhavean
adverse impact on our business prospects and operations. in addition, contractual
agreements may require us to purchase the local business after termination of the
contract,whichmayresultinsignificantcashoutflows.
following the spin-off completion, siemens will retain parts of the siemens gas and power
business in algeria, greece, india, indonesia and pakistan. in these countries and certain adjacent
sales territories, business activities of our gas and power segment will be carried out by local
siemens companies under agency and distributorship agreements under which the local siemens
companies are mostly appointed as sole selling agents with exclusive selling rights for certain gas
and power products. not being able to conduct our own sales activities in the relevant sales
territories may adversely impact our business prospects and results of operations. furthermore,
for algeria, greece, indonesia and pakistan, under framework agreements, we are required to
purchase the business from the local siemens companies if the framework agreement is
terminated, which could result in significant cash outflows. this risk is further exacerbated
because siemens could terminate the respective framework agreement before we have set up

sales territories (“indian energy business”) will be carried out under an agency and
distributorship agreement by siemens india, which is a listed company in which siemens holds
51% and we hold 24% of the shares (as of june 30, 2020). furthermore, we have negotiated a
shareholders’ agreement regulating the exercise of voting rights in siemens india and the
separation of the siemens and siemens energy business activities in certain cases. the

3.5.11 under certain conditions, we may lose the right to use the “siemens energy” or
“siemens gamesa” brands, which could leave us without a consistent brand across
our business activities or entirely without an established brand. furthermore,
siemens could intensify competition with us, in particular under the “siemens”
brand,oritcouldallowourcompetitorstodosousingthe“siemens”brand.
under a trademark and name use (sub-)license agreements (“se tla”) entered into on
march 31, 2020, between siemens ag as licensor and se global gmbh & co. kg as licensee, with
effect as of spin-off completion, siemens ag granted siemens energy (excluding sgre) the
exclusive right to, among other things, use the combined designation “siemens energy” within
our company name, internet and e-mail domains and the trademark “siemens energy” as
corporate mark and as product mark (the “se mark”) as well as the non-exclusive right to use
certain“si-”productmarks(the“selicenseddesignations”).
under the se tla, this right to use the se licensed designations is generally limited to business
fields in which the siemens segment gas and power was active as of october 1, 2019 or which
were defined in the business mandate of this segment at that time (including certain products
and services that were the subject of research and development activities ongoing at that time)
(the “se current field”). if we enter business fields outside the se current field, we can request
siemens ag to expand the scope, the consent to such request shall not be unreasonably
withheld. however, if such request is denied, we must enter business fields outside the se
current field through a separate legal entity that does not have the right to use the se licensed
designations.
the se tlahasaninitial term oftenyearsandextendsautomatically unless terminated byeither

se current field as our master brand. siemens ag has the right to terminate the se tla with
immediate effect subject to staggered transition periods in a number of instances, e.g., if
(i) siemens holds less than 25% of the shares and/or voting rights in the company (excluding
shares directly or indirectly held by siemens pension-trust e.v. or any other entity holding or
managing plan assets under or in connection with siemens group’s benefit plans), provided that
such termination may become effective earliest on september 25, 2023, (ii) a substantial
competitor of siemens group holds 15% or more of the shares and/or voting rights in the
company, (iii) another person holds 25% or more of the shares and/or voting rights in the
company, (iv) siemens has a legitimate reason to believe that the reputation of “siemens” is
materially adverselyaffected,evenwherethisisduetoasituationbeyondourcontrol,(v)wefail
to establish and maintain certain best industry practices as defined in the se tla, or (vi) we
materiallybreachthesetlaandsuchbreachisnotremedied.
sgre s.a. as licensee concluded a trademark and name use (sub-)license agreement with
siemens ag as licensor on may 20, 2020 (the “sgre tla”). under the sgre tla, siemens ag
continues to grant sgre the right to, among other things, exclusively use the combined
designation “siemens gamesa” as part of its company name, internet and e-mail domains, and
the trademark “siemens gamesa” for new products, as well as the “siemens” trademark for
existing products of the former siemens wind power business (the “sgre licensed
designations”). underthesgretla,therighttousethesgrelicenseddesignationsisgenerally
limited to business fields in which sgre was active prior to its formation in april 2017 but
61
excludes certain gamesa electric and gamesa energy transmission products and services (the
“sgre permitted activities”). if sgre enters into business fields outside of the sgre permitted
activities, it may request siemens ag to expand the scope, the consent to such request shall not
be unreasonably withheld. however, if such request is denied, sgre must enter business fields
outsidethesgrepermittedactivitiesthroughaseparatelegalentitythatdoesnothavetheright
tousethesgrelicenseddesignations.
the sgre tla has an initial term of ten years and extends automatically unless terminated by
either party. siemens ag has the right to terminate the sgre tla with immediate effect subject
to staggered transition periods in a number of instances, e.g., if (i) the se tla is terminated,
(ii) siemens energy loses control over sgre s.a., (iii) sgre s.a. stops using the designation
“siemens” as part of its company name, (iv) siemens has a legitimate reason to believe that the
reputation of “siemens” is materially adversely affected, even where this is due to a situation
beyond sgre’s control, (v) sgre fails to establish and maintain certain best industry practices
defined in the sgre tla, or (vi) sgre materially breaches the sgre tla and such breach is not
remedied.
any termination of the se tla and/or the sgre tla and, after thelapseofanytransition periods
under such agreements, as the case may be, the resulting loss of the right to use the se licensed
designations and/or the sgre licensed designations may leave our group with an inconsistent
branding across its business operations or may force us to operate under a new brand entirely.
these risks are further exacerbated by the fact that the se tla and the sgre tla require us to
use the “siemens” brand as our master brand which precludes us from establishing a brand
independentfrom“siemens”whileusingthelicensed“siemens”brands.
our right to use the se mark is exclusive for the se current field only for the combination of the
“siemens” mark with “energy”, but not for the standalone “siemens” mark. sgre’s right touse
the combined designation “siemens gamesa” is exclusive for the sgre permitted activities.
however, there are no “non-compete” undertakings by siemens in favor of siemens energy or
sgre. accordingly, we are already seeing competition by siemens which may intensify, including
in areas on which we place strategic emphasis. furthermore, siemens may compete or it could
allow our competitors to compete with us, in particular under the designation and trademark
“siemens” in the se current field or in the sgre permitted activities. any competition by
siemens or such competition by another licensee, in particular under the “siemens” brand, could
haveamaterialadverseeffectonourbusiness,financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
additionally, if the group is no longer able to use the se mark, se licensed designations, the
sgre mark, or sgre licensed designations, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business,financialpositionandresultsofoperations.
3.5.12 ourmarketperceptionmaybenegativelyinfluencedbysiemensgroup’simage.
we use the combined “siemens energy” and “siemens gamesa” as product marks, corporate
marks and as part of our company names, business designations and main domains to operate
our business. these designations clearly identify us with the siemens group, even though the
company will no longer be a consolidated subsidiary of siemens ag upon the spin-off
completion. our brand perception may be influenced by adverse developments in siemens
group. negative publicity or reputational damage of any kind or problems associated with
companies of the siemens group, even if unrelated to us and our business, could have a
detrimental effect on our reputation and brand and, as a result, a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position and results of operations. this risk is exacerbated by the fact that we

3.5.13 intheseparationfromsiemensgroupandinparticularinthespin-off,unutilizedtax

in germany, unutilized losses for corporate income tax, trade tax and interest carry forwards are
forfeitedinfullifwithinaperiodoffiveyearsmorethan50%ofacorporation’sregisteredshare
capital or voting rights are directly or indirectly transferred to an acquiring party, affiliated
individuals/entities or a group of acquirers with aligned interests, or a comparable change of
ownership in the corporation occurs (harmful acquisition – schädlicher beteiligungserwerb). the
foregoing forfeiture rules are, however, subject to certain exceptions, e.g., losses and interest
carry forwards may be preserved to the extent the losses and interest carry forwards do not
exceed the taxable hidden reserves in germany. unutilized losses for trade tax of a partnership
are in general forfeited to the extent a direct change of ownership occurs at the level of the
partnership.
in the course of the separation from siemens group, a harmful acquisition and/or change of
ownership could have occurred upon the spin-off of a limited partnership interest
(kommanditanteil) in se global gmbh & co. kg, representing 55% of the total fixed capital
(festkapital) of se global gmbh & co. kg, and 55% of the shares in siemens gas and power
management gmbh, the sole general partner of se global gmbh & co. kg, and the preceding
contribution of the remainder of the limited partnership interest (kommanditanteil) in se global
gmbh&co.kgandthesharesinsiemensgasandpowermanagementgmbhtosiemensenergy

german loss and interest carry forwards of se global gmbh & co. kg or any of its subsidiaries
couldhavebeenforfeited.
comparable rules providing for a limitation on the utilization of loss carry forwards and similar
tax attributes also exist in other jurisdictions (for instance, in the united states). therefore, the
separation also might have limited or excluded the utilization of such loss carry forwards or
similarattributesofanysiemensenergygroupcompanythathaspreviouslybeenavailable.
3.5.14 we have to consider governance rules and legal protections afforded to minority
shareholdersofsgreaswellasitsindependentfinancingactivities.
we hold approximately 67% of the shares in sgre s.a. and, following spin-off completion, will
fully consolidate the sgre results. in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, and in the
fiscal year ended september 30, 2019, our sgre segment contributed total revenue of
€ 6,615 million and € 10,227 million, respectively, to the total segments’ revenue of
€ 19,942 million and € 28,936 million, respectively. the segment further contributed € (631)
million and € 481 million to the total segments’ adjusted ebita of € (1,171) million and
€ 1,069 million in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, and in the fiscal year ended
september 30, 2019, respectively. our sgre segment thus makes a significant contribution to the
performance of the group. sgre s.a. is a publicly listed company with external shareholders. in
this context, governance rules as well as the legal protections afforded to minority shareholders
may cause delays and increase the level of complexity related to the administrative interaction
withoursgresegment.
our sgre segment finances itself independently from siemens energy. if its financial position
deteriorates, we may need to provide financial support to our sgre segment with the additional
riskthat,comparedtobankfinancingforsgre,ourclaimswouldbesubordinated.
3.6 risks related to our shareholder structure
3.6.1 siemens ag will retain a substantial shareholding in siemens energy ag following
completion of the spin-off and will be able to exercise a corresponding influence,
and the interests of siemens ag could come into conflict with the interests of other
investors.
upon spin-off completion, siemens ag, sbi and siemens pension-trust e.v. will directly and/or
indirectly hold 23.1%, 12.0% and 9.9%, respectively, of the shares, while the remaining 55% will
63
be held by the shareholders of siemens ag. in may 2020, the company and siemens ag and sbi
entered into a deconsolidation agreement (entherrschungsvertrag, the “deconsolidation
agreement”). in essence, under the deconsolidation agreement, siemens ag and sbi undertake
vis-à-vis the company to a level of self-restraint regarding the use of their voting rights in the
company in order to ensure that they will not be able to carry a vote on their own in respect of
certain essential matters. such matters include the appointment and removal of the members of
the company’s supervisory board (the “supervisory board”), certain management matters
(geschäftsführungsmaßnahmen) brought before the shareholders’ meeting of the company,
discharge (entlastung) of the members of the executive board and supervisory board, votes of
non-confidence (vertrauensentzug), board compensation matters and adoption (feststellung) of
annual accounts if the shareholders’ meeting resolves on such approval. further, siemens
undertakes vis-à-vis the company that there will be a maximum of three supervisory board
members who are depending on siemens, e.g., members of the executive board (vorstand) of
siemens ag. members of the supervisory board (aufsichtsrat) of siemens ag are not considered
closely affiliated with siemens for purposes of this threshold. the deconsolidation agreement
shall commence on the day of the spin-off completion and shall be effective at least until the
end of the fifth general shareholders’ meeting following the general shareholders’ meeting at
which the post-spin-off supervisory board is appointed. during this period, the deconsolidation
agreementcanonlybeterminatedforgoodcause.
on matters not covered by the deconsolidation agreement or if the deconsolidation agreement
is terminated, siemens ag may, depending on the shareholder presence at the general
shareholders’ meeting of the company, be in a position to control the resolutions passed by the
general shareholders’ meeting of the company with a simple majority of the votes cast or the
represented share capital. matters not covered by the deconsolidation agreement include
resolutions concerning the distribution of dividends. due to the expected attendance levels,
siemens will likely be able to control the resolutions on the distribution of dividends as long as it
does not significantly reduce its post-spin-off shareholding in the company. in addition, as long
as siemens ag holds more than 25% of the shares represented at the general shareholders’
meeting, siemens ag will be able to prevent resolutions from being adopted at the general
shareholders’meetingofthecompanywhichrequireaqualifiedmajorityofthevotescastand/or
therepresentedsharecapital.thismayinclude,interalia,capitalincreasestofinanceacquisitions
or for other purposes, structural measures (e.g., approval of enterprise, merger, spin-off or other

dr. andrea fehrmann, mr. jürgen kerner and mr. hagen reimer are expected to remain
members of the supervisory board of siemens ag following spin-off completion. since the
interests of siemens ag and the company will not necessarily always coincide or be aligned, the

3.7 risks related to the shares and the listing
3.7.1 substantialsalesofthecompany’ssharesmayoccurinconnectionwiththespin-off,
which could cause the price of the shares to decline; such sales may also occur at a
later stage. furthermore, siemens intends to significantly reduce its shareholding in
thecompanywithintwelveto18monthsafterthespin-off.
upon spin-off completion and after the listing of the shares on the frankfurt stock exchange, it
is likely that a number of shareholders receiving shares in connection with the spin-off will sell
shares, and thus that the price of the company’s shares may initially decline significantly. some
of the reasons for such afall in theshareprice couldbethatshareholderssell thesharesbecause
they do not wish to invest in the activities which have been spun off and new investors do not
buy the shares to the same extent, one reason being that no experience has yet been gained
with siemens energy ag on a stand-alone basis. in particular, unlike the shares of siemens ag,
the shares of siemens energy ag are likely not to be immediately listed in the dax; this means
that all existing investors who are required (due to their own investment guidelines, investment
risk profiles or for other reasons) to invest in stocks of dax companies would have to sell the
shares they receive under the spin-off. there are no explicit lock-up agreements of shareholders
of which we are aware, including in respect of the shareholding held by siemens following
spin-offcompletion.furthermore,siemensintendstosignificantlyreduceitsshareholdinginthe
company within twelve to 18 months after the spin-off, which could negatively affect the price
of the company’s shares. moreover, siemens pension-trust e.v. will initially hold a shareholding
of 9.9% in the company following spin-off completion. in view of the investment guidelines of
siemens pension-trust e.v. and applicable asset diversification requirements, we cannot exclude
that siemens pension-trust e.v. will reduce its shareholding, which could result in additional
selling pressure and could therefor negatively affect the price of the company’s shares. in
addition, new shares attributable to the shares of siemens ag which are traded in the form of
american depositary receipts (adr) in the u.s. will be sold by a representative of the depositary
once the spin-off becomes effective and the proceeds (net of costs) will be paid to the adr
holders. therefore, it is not unlikely that considerable selling pressure will develop immediately
after the shares are admitted to trading. in addition, there is no assurance that an active and
liquid market for the shares will develop and if at any time siemens ag or one or more other
shareholders of the company were to sell a substantial number of the shares they hold, directly
or indirectly, in the company, or if rumors arise in the market that such a sale may be imminent,
thesharepriceofthecompany’ssharesmaydecline.
3.7.2 the market price and trading volume of the company’s shares may fluctuate
significantly and could decline following spin-off completion for a variety of
reasons, and investors could lose some or all of their investment. similarly, a decline
of the share price and trading volume of sgre s.a. could negatively affect the
company’sshareprice.
the trading volume and price of the company’s shares may fluctuate significantly. the share
price is determined by the supply of and demand for the shares and may not necessarily reflect
thefair valueofthecompany.someofthefactorsthatcouldnegativelyaffectthesharepriceor
result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of the shares include, for example, ad hoc
developments(e.g.,managementchanges),changesinprofitestimates,fluctuationsinouractual
or projected operating results, changes in our projected net sales, variations in quarterly results,
failure to meet securities analysts’ expectations, the contents ofpublishedresearchreports about
the company or the industry segments or securities analysts failing or ceasing to cover the
company, actions by institutional shareholders, conflicts with anchor shareholders (in particular
siemens) and general market conditions or special factors influencing companies in the industry
ingeneral.forexample,anincreasingnumberofinvestorsfollowinvestmentguidelinesaimedat
furthering causes such as sustainability. if our product portfolio, which is still largely related to
fossil power generation, is ineligible under such investment guidelines, investors may sell or
refrain from investing in shares. furthermore, we cannot rule out that even certain products,
e.g., products for military applications or conventional components for nuclear energy
65
applications, could result in such ineligibility or have a negative connotation in the public
opinion with a material negative impact on our reputation. fluctuations in the equity markets
could also cause the share price to decline, though such general fluctuations may not necessarily
be related to our business or short to mid-term prospects. in addition, the share price could also
decline should rating agencies downgrade their rating of the company or of its subsidiary sgre
s.a. in addition, if siemens energy or sgre were to revise previously communicated targets or
guidance downwards, this could directly or indirectly negatively affect the share price of the
company’s shares. similarly, a decline of the share price and trading volume of sgre s.a. could
negatively affect the company’s share price. if the share price of the company’s shares declines,
which may be due to a variety of reasons, investors may be unable to resell their shares at or
abovetheirpurchasepriceandmaylosesomeoralloftheirinvestmentinthecompany’sshares.
3.7.3 the combined value of the company’s shares and the shares of siemens ag
following the spin-off may not equal or exceed the value of the siemens ag shares
priortothespin-off.
following the spin-off, the shares of siemens ag will continue to be listed and will be traded on
the trading day following the day of the spin-off completion taking such spin-off into account
(ex spin-off trading). we cannot assure that the combined trading prices of the siemens ag
sharesandthecompany’ssharesasallocatedtosiemensagshareholdersinaccordancewiththe
allotment ratio will be equal to or greater than the trading price of siemens ag shares prior to
the spin-off completion. until the market has fully evaluated the business of the siemens group

which the company’s shares, and to a lesser extent siemens ag shares, trade may be subject to

3.7.4 following spin-off completion, the company will be a holding company with no
material business operations of its own and will rely on operating subsidiaries to
provide the company with the funds required to meet its financial obligations and
make dividend payments. further, in casethecompanyhastorecognizeasignificant

following spin-off completion, the company will be a holding company with no material
business operations of its own. the principal assets of the company will be its direct interests in
se global gmbh & co. kg and indirect interests in its operating subsidiaries. as a result, the
company will be dependent on these subsidiaries in order to generate the funds required to
meetthecompany’sfinancialobligationsandmakedividendpayments,ifany.
the ability of the company’s subsidiaries to make distributions and other payments to the
company will depend on the subsidiaries’ earnings and is subject to various contractual and
statutory limitations. the amount and timing of such distributions depend on the laws of the

dividend payments of the company and the company would have to draw on its distributable

further, in case the company has to recognize a significant impairment on its interests in se
global gmbh & co. kg, its ability to make dividend payments would be dependent on any
resulting losses being compensated by distributable reserves and other profits such as
distributions from subsidiaries. an obligation to recognize such impairment may arise, among
other things, if the market capitalization of the company is permanently below the book value
of approximately € 13 billion at which the interests in se global gmbh & co. kg are expected to
be recognized in thefinancial statements ofsiemens energyagpreparedin accordancewith the
german commercial code (handelsgesetzbuch). further, there can be no guarantee that any

4.4 forward-looking statements
this prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements. these include statements on future
profitability, plans and expectations regarding the group’s business and management, the
group’sgrowthandearningcapacity,andgeneraleconomicandregulatoryconditionsandother
factors that may affect the group. statements made using the following or similar wording may
be forward-looking statements: “is likely”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “predicts”,
“assumes”, “estimates”, “plans” or “intends”. they can be found in several sections in the
prospectus, for example in the sections “3 risk factors”, “9 management’s discussion and
analysis of net assets, financial position and results of operations”, “10 profit forecast” and
“22recentdevelopmentsandoutlook”.
theforward-looking statements containedin theprospectus arebasedonthecompany’scurrent
estimates and assessments and made to the best of the company’s knowledge. these forward-
looking statements are based on numerous assumptions and are subject to risks, uncertainties
and other factors, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which could cause actual circumstances,
including with regard to the assets, business, financial position and results of operations as well
as profitability of the group, to differ materially from or fail to meet the expectations expressed
or implied in the forward-looking statements. even if future results ofthesiemens energygroup
meet the expectations expressed herein, they may not be indicative of the results or
developmentsinanysubsequentperiods.
siemensenergy’sbusinessisalsosubjecttoanumberofrisksanduncertaintiesthatcouldcausea
forward-looking statement, estimate or prediction in the prospectus to become inaccurate.
accordingly, investors are strongly advised to consider the prospectus as a whole and particularly
ensure that they have read the following sections of the prospectus: “3 risk factors”,
“9 management’s discussion and analysis of net assets, financial position and results of
operations”,“11industryoverview”,“12business”and“22recentdevelopmentsandoutlook”,
which include more detailed descriptions of factors that might influence siemens energy’s
business performance and the markets in which it operates. the following factors and others
describedunderothersectionsoftheprospectusshouldnotbeconstruedasexhaustive.
in light of the assumptions as well as risks, uncertainties and other factors, it is also possible that
the future events mentioned in the prospectus may not occur or may differ materially from
actual events. in addition, the forward-looking estimates and forecasts reproduced in the
prospectus from third-party sources could prove to be inaccurate. for more information on third-
party sources see “4.5 sources of market data and other information from third parties”. these
factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause the company’s actual
results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. other
unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results. the
foregoingmaypreventthecompanyfromachievingitsfinancialandstrategicobjectives.

4.5 sources of market data and other information from third parties
the prospectus contains industry and customer-related data as well as calculations sourced from
industry reports published by third parties, market research reports, publicly available
information and commercial publications of third parties. these publications generally state that
the information they contain has originated from sources assumed to be reliable, but that the
accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and that the calculations
contained therein are based on assumptions. such information has not been independently
verified bythecompanyandthecompanyassumes noresponsibility for theaccuracy ofanysuch

4.7.4 certaindefinitions
certain individual line items in the combined statements of income of siemens energy prepared
in accordance with ifrs are described under “9.6 definition and discussion of certain financial
measures”. in addition, in this prospectus, we use certain financial information neither defined
under ifrs nor, in siemens energy’s view, qualifying as alternative performance measures (see
“4.8alternativeperformancemeasures”):
where we refer to “orders” we use the following definition: orders are determined principally
as estimated revenue of accepted purchase orders for which enforceable rights and obligations
exist as well as subsequent order value changes and adjustments, excluding letters of intent. to
determine orders, siemens energy considers termination rights and customer’s creditworthiness.
we present orders on group, reportable segment and division level. orders are also presented
for our service business and new unit business (calculated as orders less orders from service
business).
we disclose total revenue for our service business and our new unit business (calculated as total
revenue less total revenue from service business) on group, reportable segment and division
level.
we refer to “book-to-bill ratio” as the ratio of orders to revenue, regarded as an economic
indicator for overall trends in siemens energy’s markets and siemens energy’s ability to
76
sustainably generate business with customers (see also “9.4.4 high revenue visibility from order
backlog”). we define book-to-bill ratio as the ratio of orders to total revenue for a specified
period, generally a quarter, a year-to-date period or a fiscal year. book-to-bill ratio is presented
on group, reportable segment and division level, and for our new unit business and service
business.
we disclose “order backlog” in order to provide information about the remaining performance
obligations in our existing contracts. order backlog is calculated by adding the orders of the
current reporting periodtothebalanceoftheorderbacklogasoftheendofthepriorreporting
period and then subtracting the revenue recognized in the current reporting period.
furthermore, direct order value adjustments such as modifications or cancellations of orders,
currency translation and portfolio effects are taken into account. we determine order backlog
ongroup,reportablesegmentanddivisionlevel.wealsopresentorderbacklogbasedonorders
and revenue from our service business and new unit business (calculated as order backlog less
orderbacklogfromservicebusiness).
wedefine“backlog-to-revenueratio”astheratiooforderbacklogasoftheendofafiscalyear
to total revenue for that fiscal year. backlog-to-revenue ratio is presented on group and
reportablesegmentlevel,andforournewunitbusinessandservicebusiness.
wedisclosethe“orderbacklogreach”forthefollowingfiscalyear,inordertoinformaboutthe
amount and timing of revenue that we expect to recognize from the remaining performance
obligations in our existing contracts. order backlog reach is determined by siemens energy in
three time intervals: within the current fiscal year, within the following fiscal year and after the
following fiscal year. we present order backlog reach on group and on reportable segment
level.
we define “revenue growth rate” as the percentage change year-over-year which is calculated
by dividing the absolute revenue difference between a base year and the previous period by the
previousperiodrevenue.
weuse“specialitems”whenwerefertothefollowingitems:
(cid:129) restructuring and integration costs –restructuring costs refer topersonnelmeasures leading
to severance charges, in the past mainly related to the gas and power segment. integration
costs refer to the sgre segment only and are related mainly to the merger of gamesa and
siemens wind power into sgre s.a. and, to a lesser extent, to the acquisition of assets from
senvion.
(cid:129) stand-alone costs – stand-alone costs relate to the preparation of our separation from
siemens group and the formation of siemens energy as an independent enterprise. they
relate to the carve-out and spin-off of siemens energy and include, amongst others, costs
forinformationtechnology(“it”)applications,externalserviceproviders,costsrelatedtothe
listing, andpersonnelrelatedcosts.forfuturereportingperiods,especiallypersonnel-related
costswillbeincurredforretentionandacceleratedvestingofshare-basedcompensation.
(cid:129) strategic portfolio decisions – major asset impairments and write-downs related to siemens
energy group strategic portfolio decisions. for example, such strategic portfolio decisions
included in the past our strategic portfolio decision to streamline our offering of aero-
derivative gas turbines. while we will continue to service all types of our aero-derivative gas
turbines and still deliver all aero-derivative gas turbines that have already been ordered, we
will over time no longer actively market our larger sized aero-derivative gas turbines. for
moreinformation,see12.3.3.1.2(2)aero-derivativegasturbines.
in the opinion of siemens energy’s management, these special items affect adjusted ebita on a
recurring or non-recurring basis. these special items are not a recognized term under ifrs.
special items are subject to certain discretion in the allocation of various income and expenses
andtheapplicationofdiscretionmaydifferfromcompanytocompany.specialitemsalsoinclude
expenses that will recur in future accounting periods. specifically, we expect further significant
personnel-related restructuring costs and to a limited extent stand-alone costs in the coming
77
fiscal years. for a break-down of special items incurred in thefiscal years2019,2018and2017,as
wellasinthenine-monthperiodsendedjune30,2020and2019,see“9.4.10.3specialitems”.
geographically, we divide our business into three reporting regions – europe, commonwealth of
independent states, the middle east and africa (“emea”), canada, the united states as well as
middle and south america (the “americas”) and the other countries of the asian continent as
well as australia and new zealand (“asia, australia”). when we discuss orders and revenue for
our reporting regions in this prospectus, orders and revenue are measured by location of
customers.

4.8.2 overviewandreconciliation
the following sections provide an overview of the apms defined above and presented by
siemens energy on the group, the reportable segment and/or division level as well as
reconciliations to siemens energy’s combined financial statements. siemens energy presents
these apms as (i) supplemental information for the specific reasons outlined above with respect
to each apm, (ii) measures of operating performance or as an auxiliary control profitability
parameterusedbyits management,including in presentationstothemembersofthecompany’s
executive board, and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting, and (iii) they represent
measures that the group believes are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and
otherpartiesassupplementalmeasuresofoperatingandfinancialperformance.theseapmsmay
enhance management’s and investors’ understanding of the company’s financial performanceby
excluding items that are not classified as part of the company’s ongoing operations, such as
interestpaymentsonloansandincomeandnon-cashexpenses.
forexample, siemens energyconsidersadjustedebitatobewidelyusedbyinvestorstomeasure
thecompany’soperatingperformance.
however, these apms are not defined by ifrs or any other internationally accepted accounting
principles, and such items should not be considered as an alternative to the historical financial
results or other indicators of siemens energy’s results of operations and financial position based
on ifrs measures. in particular, they should not be considered as alternatives to the group’s net
income/loss as an indicator of the group’s performance and profitability, or as alternatives to
cashflowsfromoperatingactivities asanindicatorofitsfinancialstrength.theapms,asdefined
by siemens energy, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as presented by other
companies due to differences in the way siemens energy’s apms are calculated. even though the
apms are used by management to assess ongoing operating performance and indebtedness, and
though these types of measures arecommonly usedbyinvestors, theyhaveimportant limitations
as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of
siemensenergy’sresults,cashflowsorassetsandliabilitiesasreportedunderifrs.

5 carve-out, spin-off and listing
5.1 overview and timetable
in preparation of the spin-off, siemens bundled its energy business under siemens gas and
power gmbh & co. kg (to be renamed siemens energy global gmbh & co. kg, “se global
gmbh & co. kg”) (the “carve-out”). following the carve-out, siemens transferred 45% of its
interest in se global gmbh & co. kg1) to the company against issuance of new shares in the
company. as part of the spin-off, siemens will transfer its remaining 55% interest in se global
gmbh&co.kg1)tothecompanyagainstissuanceofthenewshareswhichwillbetransferredto

5.2 the carve-out and the capital increases against contribution in kind
prior to the carve-out, siemens energy group’s business essentially corresponded to the business
which siemens reported as its segments “gas and power” and “siemens gamesa renewable
energy” for the three-month period ended 31 december 2019. the aim of the carve-out was,
subject to certain exceptions, to separate siemens energy’s group’s business (including the
material assets and liabilities and employees attributed to these segments) from the other
operations assets, liabilities and employees of siemens group and to have it held by a separate
sub-group with the ultimate parent se global gmbh & co. kg. for illustration purposes only, the
carve-out can be summarized by splitting it into two main parts: the transfer of the gas and
power operations in germany (“germany carve-out”) and in the rest of the world (“rest of
world carve-out”). as of the date of the prospectus, essentially all transfers to se global
gmbh & co. kg have been completed while certain follow-up measures may be necessary, such
astheregistrationofbranches,tomakethelocalbusinessfullyoperational.
after the carve-out but prior to spin-off completion, siemens transferred limited partnership
interests (kommanditanteil) representing 45% of the total fixed capital (festkapital) in se global
gmbh & co. kg and a corresponding percentage of its direct and indirect shareholding in se
global gmbh & co. kg’s sole general partner to the company (see “5.2.3 the capital increases
againstcontributioninkind”)againstissuanceoftheexistingshares.
5.2.1 germanycarve-out
pursuant to a contribution agreement entered into between siemens ag and se global gmbh &
co. kg (for more details see “18.1.1.1.1(8) german contribution agreement”) on december 20,
2019,siemensagtransferredtoseglobalgmbh&co.kgdomesticandforeignassets,including
movable assets, intellectual property (“ip”), lease agreements, legal entities, employees and
contracts, liabilities and other transferable rights and obligations directly held by siemens ag
and attributable to siemens’ “gas and power” business as well as a shareholding of
approximately 30% in sgre s.a. and certain newly created central departments for siemens
energy. the transfers became effective on january 1, 2020. however, the actual legal transfer of
certain rights, title in assets and contracts may be subject to the prior completion of registration
processes and/or the receipt of third-party consents. in most of these cases, the german
contributionagreementprovidesforaneconomictransferofsuchrights,titleinassets,contracts
and the like, i.e., the parties of the german contribution agreement agreed in most of the cases
to put each other into the same economic position as if the legal transfer had occurred. as
considerationforthiscontribution,theinterestofsiemensaginthefixedcapital(festkapital)of
seglobalgmbh&co.kgwasincreased.
after completion of the germany carve-out, approximately 29% of the shares in sgre s.a.,
initially held by siemens’ subsidiary siemens beteiligungen inland gmbh (“sbi gmbh”), were
contributed to se global gmbh & co. kg, raising its shareholding in sgre s.a. to approximately
59%.
5.2.2 restofworldcarve-out
in most other countries in which the respective local siemens energy business was, prior to the
carve-out, not conducted in a separate legal entity, the relevant local siemens energy business
was separated from the other siemens business in general before march 31, 2020 (the “local
carve-outs”). the separations were largely implemented through the formation of new local
legal entities, or, acquisitions of empty shell companies, into which the local siemens energy
business was transferred either through corporate or transformation law measures under local
law(e.g.,throughspin-offs) orbasedonpurchaseorcontributionagreements.insomecountries,
the local siemens energy business was transferred into an already existing local legal entity that
was attributed to the future siemens energy group. in a limited number of countries, the
separation was implemented by means of a reverse carve-out. in such cases, the existing siemens
business was carved out of local siemens group entities into newly formed siemens group
entities, with the siemens energy business remaining in the existing local siemens group entity.
89
although the respective agreements for the local carve-outs were in general entered into
before march 31, 2020, the actual legal transfer of certain rights, title in assets and contracts is
pending the completion of registration processes and/or the receipt of third-party consents in
some countries. to the extent legally permissible, the respective agreements for the local carve-
outs provide in general for an economic transfer of such rights, title in assets, contracts and the
like, i.e., the parties of such local carve-out agreements agreed in principle to put each other
into the same economic position as if the legal transfer had already occurred in the period
between the date on which the transfer of the respective right, title in asset and contract should
haveoccurredandthedateonwhichthetransferactuallyoccurred.
to a certain extent our business is operated through branches, representation offices or
permanent establishments of a local energy business in another country. new branches,
representation offices or permanent establishments may have to be registered to make the local
business fully operational. in a few countries, including iraq, taiwan and the united arabic
emirates, the registration is pending completion for various reasons, such as local lockdowns due
to covid-19, newly enacted local legal requirements or lengthy local registration procedures.
the respective agreements for the local carve-outs provide in principle for an economic transfer
of affected rights, title in assets, contracts, liabilities and the like, i.e., the parties of such local
carve-out agreements agreed to put each other into the same economic position as if the legal
transfer had already occurred in the period between the date on which the transfer of the
respective right, title in asset, contract and liability should have occurred and the date on which
the transfer actually occurred. with regard to new projects, i.e., agreements that are to be
entered into after the date on which the respective local carve-out should have occurred,
siemens and siemens energy agreed on a defined process under which on a case-by-case basis
siemens and siemens energy will evaluate whether a workaround, such as project execution by
the respective local siemens entity for the benefit of siemens energy against a respective
consideration,willbefeasible.
in a second step, the shares in the local siemens energy entities, which, following the execution
of the separations, are aimed to exclusively hold the respective local siemens energy business,
were, to the extent such shares were not already held by siemens gas and power holding b.v. or
any of its subsidiaries, generally transferred to siemens gas and power holding b.v. in other
cases, certain local siemens energy businesses, especially the local siemens energy business in the
u.s., were not separated by way of a local carve-out and transferred to siemens gas and power
holding b.v.; instead, shares in the already existing local siemens energy entities were directly
contributed or transferred to siemens gas and power holding b.v. or se global gmbh & co. kg.
in bangladesh, the reverse carve-out transfer is still pending and expected to become effective in
december 2020, due to lengthy local registration procedures. in a few countries, including,
kuwait, ghana, egypt and united arab emirates, the local registration procedures for giving
effect to the share transfers have not been completed yet. in these countries the local share
transfer agreements provide that the respective share sellers and the respective share purchasers
shall, from the respective date on which the agreement for the transfer of shares became
effective until the date on which the title in the shares has been legally transferred, put each
otherintothesameeconomicpositionasifthelegaltransferhadoccurred.
furthermore, in some countries, no local carve-outs took place. instead, siemens and siemens
energy have concluded agency agreements under which siemens group entities carry out
siemens energy businesses for siemens energy (see “18.1.1.1.1(5) agreements with regard to
siemens energy’s gas and power business in algeria, greece, indonesia and pakistan” and
“18.1.1.1.1(6) agreements related to the conduct ofsiemens energy’s gasandpowerbusiness in
india”).forrisksrelatedtocarve-outmeasures,see“3.5risksrelatedtoourseparationfromthe
siemensgroup”.
for joint ventures relating to the siemens energy business, siemens has obtained consents from
the joint venture partners for the purchase by or transfer of joint venture participations to
siemens energy with certain exceptions, most notably including the joint venture shanghai
electric power generation equipment co., ltd., shanghai, china (the “shanghai electric jv”).
90
siemens holds a participation of 40% in the shanghai electric jv and has agreed with siemens
energy that siemens energy shall acquire this participation following spin-off completion,
subject to the consent of the joint venture partner. upona request to grant its consent, siemens’
joint venture partner has a pre-emption purchase right, which could be exercised. the purchase
price to be paid by siemens energy for the participation in the shanghai electric jv will be
determined by an external valuation firm. the expected purchase price for the participation was
contributed in advance to the group in cash. should the actual purchase price as determined by
the external valuation firm differ from the expected purchase price, siemens energy will need to
paytosiemens therespective difference andvice versa. shouldthejoint venturepartnerexercise
its pre-emption purchase right, the group would retain the contribution already made by
siemens up to the amount of the purchase price to be paid by the joint venture partner. the
purchasepriceitselfwouldaccruetosiemensforlocallegalreasons.
pursuant to a contribution agreement entered into between siemens ag and se global gmbh &
co. kg on march 30, 2020, siemens ag transferred to se global gmbh & co. kgwith effect asof
march 31, 2020 (i) its shares in siemens gas and power holding b.v., holding most of the shares
in siemens energy’s global operations, (ii) its shares in siemens energy inc., holding the shares in
siemens energy’s us operations, (iii) its shares in siemens gas and power s.a. and (iv) its
meanwhile acquired, approximately 8.1%, shares in sgre s.a. further, siemens contributed
approximately € 6.2 billion via clearing accounts to capitalize siemens energy. subsequently,
siemens provided another approximately € 0.1 billion in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in
approximately € 6.4 billion as of june 30, 2020, that were provided to siemens energy. this
figure includes approximately € 3 billion to satisfy the purchase price obligations of siemens
energy for asset transfers by siemens that were not carved out until march 31, 2020. as
consideration for this contribution, siemens ag’s partnership interest (kommanditanteil) in se
globalgmbh&co.kgwasincreased.
thereafter, until the capital increases against contribution in kind, siemens and sbi gmbh held
partnership interests (kommanditanteile) representing 87.98% and 12.02% of the total fixed
capital (festkapital) of se global gmbh & co. kg, respectively, and corresponding share
percentagesinseglobalgmbh&co.kg’ssolegeneralpartnersemgmbh.

12.02% of its share capital. as consideration for these contributions, siemens ag received
239,582,401 new shares in the company (the “siemens new se shares”), thereby increasing the

5.3.1 spin-offprocedure
on may 22, 2020, the company and siemens ag entered into the spin-off and transfer
agreement. the effectiveness of this agreement was, inter alia, subject to the approval by a 75%
majority of the company’s and siemens ag’s general shareholders’ meetings. these approvals
were obtained on may 22 and july 9, 2020 respectively. pursuant to the spin-off and transfer
agreement, siemens committed to transfer the partnership interest (kommanditanteil) it
currently holds in se global gmbh & co. kg (representing 55% of se global gmbh & co. kg’s
total fixed capital (festkapital)) and the shares it currently holds in its sole general partner, sem
gmbh (representing 55% of the share capital of sem gmbh) to siemens energy ag by way of a
spin-off for absorption (abspaltung zur aufnahme). in return, the shareholders of siemens ag
shall receive the new shares created by way of the spin-off capital increase which will represent
55% of the shares following completion of the spin-off. the spin-off and transfer agreement

5.4.6 informationtodistributors
each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment with respect to
the shares and determining appropriate distribution channels. solely for the purposes of the
product governance requirements contained within: (a) directive 2014/65/eu of may 15, 2014 on
markets in financial instruments, as amended (“mifid ii”); (b) articles 9 and 10 of commission
delegated directive (eu) 2017/593 supplementing mifid ii; and (c) local implementing measures
(together, the “mifid ii product governance requirements”), and disclaiming all and any
liability, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, which any “manufacturers” (for the
purposes of the mifid ii product governance requirements) may otherwise have with respect
thereto, the shares have been subject to a product approval process by the banks. as a result, it
has been determined that such shares are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail
investors and investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties,
each as defined in mifid ii; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution channels as
arepermitted bymifid ii (the “targetmarketassessment”). notwithstandingthetargetmarket
assessment, any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the shares (a
“distributor” for the purpose of the mifid ii product governance requirements) should note
that: the price of the shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment;
the shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the
shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital
protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser)
are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient
resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. the target market assessment
is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling and
transfer restrictions in relation to any subsequent offering or resale of the shares and does not
constitute (i) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of mifid ii or (ii) a
recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, purchase, or take any other
actionwhatsoeverwithrespectto,theshares.
in addition, other restrictions may apply in other jurisdictions in relation to any subsequent
offering, transfer or resale of the shares. potential investors or distributors should make their
own assessment on the suitability, appropriateness and lawfulness of any such offering, transfer
orresaleandastotheirowninvestmentdecisionand,ifappropriate,seekprofessionaladvicefor
the relevant jurisdiction or jurisdictions. in particular, it may be unlawful in certain jurisdictions,
including malaysia and the people’s republic of china, to make shares available to others,
including through a resale, allotment, delivery or transfer, without a registration or the
publication of a disclosure document approved or otherwise endorsed by the competent
authorityinsuchjurisdictionsunlessanexemptionorwaiverapplies.

6 reasons for the spin-off and listing and costs
of spin-off and listing
6.1 reasons for the spin-off and listing
as a part of its strategy program, referred to as “vision 2020+”, siemens decided to implement
the spin-off thereby giving siemens energy its independence and entrepreneurial freedom to
pursue its own strategy, resource allocation, strengthen the focus on its customers, technologies,
risks and markets and adapt quicker to the rapidly changing market conditions. in particular,
siemens energy expects to benefit from the ability to independently decide on the allocation of
financialandotherresourcestosuccessfullynavigatetherapidlychangingmarketconditions.
the company intends to list its entire share capital on the regulated market (regulierter markt)
of the frankfurt stock exchange (frankfurter wertpapierbörse) and, simultaneously, on the
sub-segment with additional post admission obligations (prime standard) of the frankfurt stock
exchange(frankfurterwertpapierbörse)togainaccesstothecapitalmarkets.
6.2 costs of spin-off and listing

7 dividend policy
7.1 general rules on allocation of profits and dividend payments
the shareholders’ share of profits is determined based on their respective interests in the
company’s share capital. in a german stock corporation (aktiengesellschaft), resolutions
concerning the distribution of dividends for a given fiscal year, and the amount thereof, are
adoptedbythegeneralshareholders’meeting(hauptversammlung)ofthesubsequentfiscal year
upon a joint proposal by the executive board and the supervisory board. dividends may only be
distributed from the distributable profit (bilanzgewinn) of the company. the distributable profit
is calculated based on the company’s unconsolidated financial statements prepared in
accordance with the accounting principles of the german commercial code (handelsgesetzbuch)
and the german stock corporation act (aktiengesetz). accounting principles set forth in the
germancommercialcode(handelsgesetzbuch)differfromifrsinmaterialrespects.
when determining the distributable profit, the net income (loss) for the year must be adjusted
for profit/loss carry-forwards from the prior fiscal year and release of or allocations to reserves.
certain reserves are required to be set up by law and respective allocations must be deducted
when calculating the net income (loss) before profit distribution. certain additional limitations
apply if self-created intangible assets or deferred tax assets have been capitalized or certain plan
assets that exceed corresponding pension liabilities have been capitalized. the executive board
must prepare the annual financial statements (balance sheet, income statement and notes to the
financial statements) and the management report for the previous fiscal year by the statutory
deadline, and present these to the supervisory board and the auditors immediately after
preparation. at the same time, the executive board must present to the supervisory board a
proposal for the allocation of the company’s distributable profit. the supervisory board must
review the annual financial statements, the executive board’s management report and the
proposal for the allocation of the distributable profit, and report to the general shareholders’
meeting in writing on the results. the supervisory board must submit its report to the executive
board within one month after the documents were received. if the supervisory board approves
the annual financial statements after its review, these are deemed adopted unless the executive
boardandsupervisoryboardresolvetoassignadoptionoftheannualfinancialstatementstothe
general shareholders’ meeting. if the executive board and supervisory board choose to allow the
general shareholders’ meeting to adopt the annual financial statements, or if the supervisory
board does not approve the annual financial statements, the executive board must convene a
generalshareholders’meetingwithoutdelay.
the general shareholders’ meeting’s resolution on the allocation of the distributable profit must
be passed with a simple majority of votes. if the executive board and supervisory board adopt
the annual financial statements, they can allocate an amount of up to half of the company’s net
income for the year to other surplus reserves. additions to the legal reserves and loss carry-
forwards must be deducted in advance when calculating the amount of net income for the year
to be allocated to other surplus reserves. pursuant to section 20 paragraph 4 of the articles of
association the general shareholders’ meeting may decide that the distributable profits be
appropriated by means of a distribution in kind, instead of, or in addition to, a cash dividend. in
the resolution on the appropriation of the net profit, the general shareholders’ meeting may
allocate amounts to reserves or carry them forward as profit. dividends resolved by the general
shareholders’ meeting are due and payable on the third business day (geschäftstag) following
the day of the relevant general shareholders’ meeting, unless a later due date is provided in the
dividend resolution, in compliance with the rules of the respective clearing system. generally,
withholding tax is withheld from the dividends paid. for more information on the taxation of
dividends,see“19.2taxationofdividends”.
dividend payment claims are subject to a three-year standard limitation period. if dividend
payment claims expire, then the company becomes the beneficiary of the dividends. details
concerning any dividends resolved by the general shareholders’ meeting and the paying agents
namedbythecompanyineachcasewillbepublishedinthefederalgazette(bundesanzeiger).

7.2 dividend policy
siemens energy ag did not pay any dividends in the past. subject to a statutory minimum
dividend of up to approximately € 29 million in case sufficient distributable profit is reported in
the company’s audited unconsolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2020 prepared in
accordance with the requirements of german commercial law applicable to corporations,
siemens energy ag will not make a dividend payment for the fiscal year 2020. with respect to
thefollowing fiscal years, thecompanyintendstoproposeadividendwhosedistribution volume
is 40% to 60% of the group’s net income attributable to shareholders of siemens energy ag as
shownintheconsolidatedfinancialstatementsofthecompanypreparedinaccordancewithifrs
of the respective prior fiscal year. for this purpose, this net income may be adjusted for
extraordinary non-cash effects. generally, it is intended to fund the dividend payout from
available free cash flow taking into account dividend payments received from sgre s.a., which
intendstoproposeadividendinadistributionvolumeofnolessthan25%ofitsnetincome.
however, the company’s ability to pay dividends in future years will depend on the amount of
distributable profit based on the company’s audited unconsolidated financial statements
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles of the german commercial code
(handelsgesetzbuch). in this context, it should be noted that the company will be a holding
company with no material business operations of its own. as a result, it will be dependent on its
subsidiaries in order to generate and transfer the funds required to make dividend payments, if
any. further, in case the company has to recognize a significant impairment on its interests in se
global gmbh & co. kg, its ability to make dividend payments could be limited. accordingly, no
assurance regarding the amounts of future distributable profits, if any, can be provided.
consequently,wecanprovidenoassurancethatwewillpaydividendsinfutureyears.
due to expected attendance levels, siemens will likely be able to control the resolutions on the
distribution of dividends as long as it does not significantly reduce its post-spin-off shareholding
inthecompany.

9 management’s discussion and analysis of net
assets, financial position and results of
operations
investors should read the following discussion and analysis of our net assets, financial position
and results of operations in conjunction with the sections “3 risk factors”, “4.4 forward-looking
statements”, “4.7 note regarding the presentation of financial information”, “4.8 alternative
performance measures” and “12 business”, the audited combined financial statements, the
unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements and the audited unconsolidated
financial statements, which are included in this prospectus. for further information on the
financialstatements,seealsopagesf-1etseq.
the audited combined financial statements were prepared in accordance with ifrs and have
been audited in accordance with section 317 of the german commercial code
(handelsgesetzbuch – “hgb”) and in compliance with german generally accepted standards for
financial statement audits promulgated by the institute of public auditors in germany (institut
der wirtschaftsprüfer – “idw”), by ey, who issued an unqualified independent auditor’s report
thereon.theauditedunconsolidatedfinancialstatementswerepreparedinaccordancewiththe
requirements of german commercial law applicable to business corporations and have been
audited by ey in accordance with section 317 hgb and in compliance with german generally
accepted standards for financial statement audits promulgated by the idw, who issued an
unqualified independent auditor’s report thereon. the unaudited condensed combined interim
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with ifrs on interim financial reporting
(ias34).
in contrast to the preparation of consolidated financial statements, the preparation of the
combined financial statements requires additional significant management (as defined below)
judgments when determining the respective combination rules, which affect the recognition and
amount of assets and liabilities, income and expenses andcontingentliabilities. in suchcases, the
actual results may differ from our assumptions or estimates. in addition, the combined financial
statements include companies that were held by siemens group during the relevant reporting
periods. therefore, the combined financial statements do not claim to represent the net assets,
financial position and results of operations or cash flows that would have resulted had the
siemens energy group existed in its current form since october 1, 2016, nor can the net assets,
financial position and results of operations or cash flows as shown in the above-mentioned
financial statements be extrapolated for future periods or a future reporting date. see “9.3 basis
ofpreparation”below.
where financial data in the following tables is presented as “audited”, this means that it was
taken from the audited combined financial statements or the audited unconsolidated financial
statements. wherefinancial dataispresentedinthefollowing tablesas“unaudited”,itindicates
that the financial data has not been taken from the audited combined financial statements or
the audited unconsolidated financial statements but has been taken either from the unaudited
condensed combined interim financial statements mentioned above or from siemens energy’s
accounting records or internal management reporting system or has been calculated based on
figuresfromtheabove-mentionedsources.
certain tables in this section also include certain apms. however, these apms are not defined by
ifrs or any other internationally accepted accounting principles, and such items should not be
considered as an alternative to the historical financial results or other indicators of siemens
energy’s results of operations and financial position based on ifrs measures. in particular, they
should not be considered as alternatives to the group’s net income/loss as an indicator of the
group’s performance and profitability, or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities
as an indicator of its financial strength. the apms, as defined by siemens energy, may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures as presented by other companies due to differences in
the way siemens energy’s apms are calculated. even though the apms are used by management
106
to assess ongoing operating performance and indebtedness, and though these types of measures
are commonly used by investors, they have important limitations as analytical tools, and you
should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of siemens energy’s results,
cashflowsorassetsandliabilitiesasreportedunderifrs.
financial information presented in parentheses or preceded by a “minus” sign in the prospectus
denote a negative amount. certain numerical data, financial information and market data in the
prospectus have been rounded in accordance with commercial rounding. unless otherwise
indicated, all financial data presented in the text and tables in this section of this prospectus is
shown in millions of euros (€ million), commercially rounded to the nearest million. percentage
changes and ratios in the text and tables of the prospectus are calculated based on the
underlying numbers as presented in this prospectus, i.e., after rounding of such underlying
numbers, and then commercially rounded to a whole percentage or to one digit after the
decimal point. insomeinstances,suchroundedfiguresandpercentagesmaynotaddupto100%

9.3 basis of preparation
9.3.1 separationfromsiemens
on may 7, 2019, siemens ag announced its plans to publicly list the siemens energy business on
the stock exchange in the form of a spin-off, by issuing siemens energy shares to the
shareholders of siemens ag. following spin-off completion, 55.0% of the siemens energy ag
shareswillbetransferredtotheshareholdersofsiemensag.subsequently,thesharesinsiemens
energyagwillbelistedonthestockexchange(see“5carve-out,spin-offandlisting”).siemens
will retain a shareholding of initially 45.0% but conditional upon spin-off completion
transferred 9.9% of the shares to siemens pension-trust e.v. (see “5.3.4 corporate structure
after the spin-off”). for information regarding the establishment of the company, see
“14.1formation,incorporation,commercialregister,name”.
in order to combine the siemens energy business within the group, certain carve-out and
reorganization measures have been undertaken and implemented in the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year 2019 and the first three quarters of the fiscal year 2020 (for more details, see “5.2 the
carve-out and the capital increases against contribution in kind”). the separation of the
108
siemens energy business from siemens will be mostly completed with the spin-off (see “5.3 the
spin-off”).
as of the spin-off completion, siemens energy ag, munich, germany, will be the parent

9.3.2 preparationandscopeofthecombinedfinancialstatements
9.3.2.1 preparationofthecombinedfinancialstatements
the audited combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with ifrs as
adopted by the eu. the unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements were
preparedinaccordancewithifrsoninterimfinancialreporting(ias34).
since ifrs provides no guidelines for the preparation of combined financial statements, rules
given in ias 8.12 have been used. ias 8.12 requires the consideration of the most recent
pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial requirements and recognized
industry practices. following ias 8.12, the predecessor accounting approach was applied in the
combined financial statements of siemens energy. the same accounting policies and
measurementprinciples wereappliedinpreparingthecombinedfinancialstatementsasusedby
the siemens energy entities and operations in preparing their financial information for inclusion
in the consolidated financial statements of siemens ag, which are prepared in accordance with
ifrs, for the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 (“siemens ag ifrs consolidated financial
statements”). accounting estimates originally used in the siemens ag ifrs consolidated
financial statements have not been adjusted to reflect potential new knowledge before being
includedinthecombinedfinancialstatements.
the audited combined financial statements of siemens energy reflect the following businesses
as included in the siemens ag consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2019,
adjustedforlegalentitieswherenolegaltransfertosiemensenergyisplanned,namely:
(i) thesiemenssegment“gasandpower”;
(ii) thesiemenssegment“sgre”;and
(iii) the following siemens’ businesses that fall within the scope of siemens energy’s gas and
power segment: process solutions business, excluding the minerals business; subsea business;
distribution transformer business; the hydrogen solution unit and research activities within
the technology field “power-to-x” and storage; at-equity investments in voith hydro
holding gmbh & co. kg and ethosenergy group limited; and the 24% minority
shareholding (as of june 30, 2020) in siemens ltd., india (“siemens india”) acquired under a
share transfer agreement dated march 30, 2020, which is fully consolidated at siemens ag.
there is an exclusive agency and distributorship agreement in place, regulating thatsiemens
india will continue to execute the gas and power business. for more information on the
conduct of the gas and power segment’s business in india, see “12.3.4.2.3 shareholding in
siemens india” and “18.1.1.1.1(6) agreements related to the conduct of siemens energy’s
gas and power business in india”). in some other countries (including algeria, greece,
indonesia and pakistan) the local gas and power business was not transferred to siemens
energy due to, e.g., limited size or regulatory reasons. instead, siemens group companies
will continue to execute the gas and power business on the basis of agency and
distributorship agreements entered into with siemens energy for their own account (see
“18.1.1.1.1(5) agreements with regard to siemens energy’s gas and power business in
algeria,greece,indonesiaandpakistan”).
the financial information for the segments gas and power and sgre included in the unaudited
condensed combined interim financial statements is derived from the segment reporting of
siemens group, before applying the presentation and measurement principles of ifrs 5 for
discontinued operations. the segment reporting included certain cost allocations for centrally
managedfunctions prior tothelegalseparation.thefinancialinformationfortheminoritystake
insiemensindiaisderivedfromthesiemensagifrsreportingpackageofthisentity.
109
in order to reflect the assets, liabilities, income and expenses that fall within the scope of
siemens energy, certain combination rules as set out in note 1 to the audited combined
financial statement have been applied. the managing board and supervisory board of siemens
ag, the executive board of siemens energy and the board of directors and remaining senior
management staff (who are not members of the board of directors) of sgre s.a. (together, the
“management”) used significant judgment in determining these combination rules for the
preparation of the audited combined financial statements and the unaudited condensed
combined interim financial statements, respectively. thus, the combined financial statements
presented in this prospectus do not necessarily reflect the net assets, financial position, results of
operations or cash flows that would have resulted if siemens energy had existed as a separate
groupintheperiodspresented.
9.3.2.2 scopeofcombination
the scope of combination for the combined financial statements was determined on the
principles of the legal reorganization approach. this approach is based on the fact that the
economic activities that form the new group were not managed centrally in the past, but that
the entities are legally bound together within a reorganization process. during the reporting
periods of the combined financial statements, the assets and liabilities forming the combination
scopewereundercommoncontrolofsiemensag.
the scope of combination includes companies and businesses that will be directly or indirectly
and fully or partially owned by siemens energy ag after the legal reorganization and the
spin-off of the siemens energy group has been completed. this includes entities that were
controlled by siemens ag or its subsidiaries during the reporting periods of the combined
financial statements and for which a legal transfer to siemens energy ag is planned prior to the
spin-off. accordingly, the 40% participation siemens group holds in the joint venture shanghai
electric power generation equipment co., ltd., china, the transfer of which shall occur in the
fiscal year 2021 (see “12.3.2.1.1(3) shanghai electric power generation equipment co., ltd.”),
does not fall within the scope of combination. businesses in accordance with ifrs 3 under
common control that were transferred to siemens energy during the legal reorganization are
included with their respective assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses in the
combinedfinancialstatementsforallperiodsduringwhichsiemensagcontrolledtheseentities.
for legal entities transferring to siemens energy that had already been fully dedicated to the
siemens energy business and for which no carve-out has been required, the combined financial
statementsalsoincludeallnon-businessassets,liabilities,incomeandexpensesofthelegalentity
(mainly financing activities and real estate). for legal entities that required a legal separation,
certain assets and liabilities or obligations transferred to siemens energy that historically have
not been part of the siemens energy business are recognized in the combined financial
statements at the time of the transfer as further detailed in note 1 to the audited combined
financialstatements.
9.4 principal factors affecting the results of operations
9.4.1 trendsintheenergysector
ourresultsofoperationsareaffectedbycertaintrendsintheenergysector.amongothers,these
trends include global energy demand, which is projected to increase in the mid- to long-term, in
particular a projected rising demand for electricity and an increasing electrification of large
sectors of the economy, the trend towards decarbonization, including sector coupling and the
increasing use of hydrogen (in particular “green” hydrogen) as well as the trend towards
digitalization in the energy markets. for more information on these industry trends, see
“11industryoverview”,inparticular“11.1.3generaltrendsintheenergysector”.
9.4.1.1 trendsimpactingthegasandpowersegment
in general, the markets of our gas and power segment are strongly affected by changes in
energy demand, national energy regulations (such as support of renewable energy), security of
110
supply through capacity markets or strategic reserve capacity, carbon pricing and climate change
targets, and modernization of energy and electricity markets (on these trends, see
“11.1.3generaltrendsintheenergysector”).
the transmission division of our gas and power segment benefits from these structural trends in
the energy sector. decarbonization is shifting the focus of both centralized and distributed
power generation from conventional to renewables. this shift increases demand for offshore
connectivity and grid stability, requiring environmentally friendly products and systems. the
integration of wind power, photovoltaic (“pv”), biomass and other intermittent or distributed
energy resources as well as of energy storage into efficient and reliable power networks
increases grid complexity. expanding economies and rising demand for power, mainly in
developing countries from the asian markets (excluding china), are fueling the demand for
power transmission networks. many developed countries, including the united states and
european countries, are also investing in improving their aging power infrastructure with new
and advanced technologies, and we expect that countries in the asia, pacific region will invest in
replacing and refurbishing their existing grid infrastructure as well. growth in demand for
transmission technologies is driven by large-scale sector coupling, for instance the increase of
green hydrogen production in countries with cheap electricity from renewable sources. the
increase of efficiencies of existing grid assets and their performance through digitalization is
becoming more important. furthermore, the integration of renewables into the power grid also
requires the adoption of new technologies because of increased complexity, not only for
transmitting power, owing to their intermittent power generation, but also for energy storage.
with substantial renewable energy mandates in place, several european countries, the united
states and china are currently heavily investing in grid-scale energy storage projects.
digitalization involves increased product and system connectivity and providing intelligent
solutions for the management of complex energy networks. connected assets provide value
potential for additional services and enhanced asset operation. these structural trends are to a
significant degree driven by energy policy relating to power generation and grid infrastructure,
including tax incentives in the u.s. and regulatory frameworks in the european union, which
affect our customers’ spending behavior and consequently, the demand for our offerings. on
trends specifically affecting our transmission division, see further “11.2.2 market size,
developmentandtrends”.
for our generation division, the effects of the aforementioned structural trends in the energy
sector vary, as some countries focus on base load generation from conventional energy sources
while other countries focus on decarbonization and shift to renewable sources. in general, the
power generation industry has started an energy transition moving from conventional power
generation to renewable sources, with a significant decrease on the relevance of coal. the
ongoing strong growth in demand for power from renewable sources, which come with
associated short-term fluctuations in power generation levels, is however shifting market
demand, in particular in europe, latin america and asia, from fossil fuel baseload generation to
more flexible, highly efficient and affordable gas power plants with low emissions. in the fiscal
years2017and2018,themarketsforlargesteamturbinesandgasturbinesforcentralizedpower
generation continued to shrink due to an ongoing shift from coal-fired to gas-fired and
renewable power generation, given their lower emissions. this shift was also driven by carbon
emission regulation. in the fiscal year 2019, the markets for industrial steam turbines and
medium gas turbines were stable. in the mid- to long-term, gas-fired generation is expected to
increase by nearly 50% until 2040, in part as a result of its role in providing flexibility to power
systems (see “11.3.2 market size, development and trends”). we expect central generation
services to remain stable. we believe that the stability of this business is supported by our large
(and regionally diversified) fleet, demand for modernizations of existing customer assets to meet
future decarbonization targets and digital solutions for further performance optimization. the
decentralization trend is positively impacting our generation division’s distributed generation
business, with industrial demand mostly coming from industrialized countries in europe and the
americas as well as emerging economies in asia. for trends specifically affecting our generation
division,seefurther“11.3.2marketsize,developmentandtrends”.
111
for our industrial applications division, the role of natural gas compared to other fossil fuels is
growing in the oil & gas industry in the mid- to long-term, facilitated by its lower carbon
footprint. furthermore, declining production due to maturing or depleting oil and gas fields,
requires improved recovery technologies necessitating continuous investments in additional
mechanical and electrical power. at the same time, oil & gas companies increasingly focus on
asset economics and emission footprint which requires products and solutions offering at high
level of asset productivity, safety and environmental performance. this trend drives, amongst
other things, the demand for efficiency-related modernizations and upgrades of existing/
brownfield equipment offered by the industrial applications division. for trends specifically
affecting our industrial applications division, see further “11.4.2 market size, development and
trends”.
9.4.1.2 trendsimpactingthesgresegment
demand for the offerings of our sgre segment is primarily affected by global energy demand
and the share of renewable energy in energy production. the share of renewable energy in the
global energy mix is widely expected to increase, in particular due to the continuing trend
towards decarbonization and more sustainable energy production (see “11.5.2 general market
characteristics, trends and drivers”). however, the trend towards evaluating competing power
sources using life cycle costs continues to put pressure on the prices offered by wind power
providers. market development also strongly depends on energy policy, including tax incentives
in the u.s. and regulatory frameworks in the european union. however, with continued
technological progress and cost reduction, dependency on subsidy schemes is expected to
continuetodecrease.
the introduction of auctions as a mechanism for allocating renewable energy capacity or
production in electricity markets has historically resulted in price pressure and an increase in
competition among wind turbine manufacturers (and with other energy sources with respect to
technology-neutral auctions). in addition, with the global transition from feed-in-tariffs to
auction mechanisms to procure renewables-based electricity at competitive prices largely
completed, the wind energy market has seen a stabilization of price levels in recent auctions, for
example in onshore auctions in several countries in 2019, after the introduction of auctions in
previous years had led to a sharp decline in prices (see “11.5.2.1 trends relating to market
mechanisms”). however, local and structural issues can still overlay this trend as, for example a
market downturn in india in 2020 has shown. a higher share of renewable energy in electrical
grids also increases the demand for predictability of the energy supply and increased capability
for integrating it into the overall energy mix. moreover, the attractive auction prices have in
return triggered discussions on a further increase of the national target volumes in several
countries,whichwouldactasapositivefactorforthesgresegment.
for more information on trends relevant to our sgre segment, see “11.5.2 general market
characteristics,trendsanddrivers”.
9.4.2 globaleconomicandgeopoliticalconditions
the global nature of our activities means that demand for our products, integrated systems,
solutions and services, and, therefore, our results of operations have, and will continue to be,
affected by global economic and geopolitical conditions. deteriorating economic conditions,
adverse geopolitical conditions and uncertainties about future conditions could cause our
customers to delay, cancel or refrain from placing orders with us. economic and geopolitical
conditions also affect, and are affected by, market prices for oil and gas. we believe that our
broad portfolio with offerings for almost the entire value chain in the energy industry and in
many process industries, as well as for other industrial applications adds resilience to our
business. the mix of products, systems and solutions we offer also includes execution of multi-
yearprojects,oftenwithhighvolumes.dependingonthetypeofproduct,systemorsolution,we
agree delivery terms or construction phases ranging up to multiple months or years with our
customers. generally, changes of global economic or geopolitical conditions, including their
112
effects on oil and gas prices, may therefore not always impact our results immediately, or to the
samerelativeextenttosuchchanges.
furthermore, our service business is affected by these changes to a lesser degree as we service a
large share of our installed fleet of units, often with long lifespans, and for which we in many
cases conclude multi-year service contracts. our service business in particular shows resilience to
adverse short- and mid-term changes in global economic conditions and oil and gas prices due to
the need of many of our customers to maintain mission-critical assets and increase efficiencies
(seealso“9.4.5.2recurringprofitablerevenuefromourservicebusiness”).
9.4.2.1 generaleffectsofchangesinoilandgasprices
demand for certain of our products, systems solutions and services, in particular for elements of
our gas and power segment and its generation and industrial applications divisions, is to a
certain degree affected by oil and gas prices. since oil and gas prices are set on a commodity
basis, spot market and futures market prices, their volatility, but also storage capacities impact
our customers’ business activities and their investment behavior. market prices for oil and gas
depend on a number of factors, including global or local supply and demand, inventory levels,
available infrastructure (including means of transportation) macroeconomic and geopolitical
conditions and certain trends in the oil & gas industry (see also “9.4.1.1 trendsimpacting thegas
and power segment”). the demand for oil and gas has in the past been highly correlated with
globaleconomicgrowth.
in the event of long-term low or volatile oil and gas prices or when such prices are expected to
belowoveralongerperiodinthefuture,customersincertainmarketsegmentsinwhichourgas
and power segment is active may reduce their capital expenditures. this is particularly applicable
in the upstream and midstream segment of the oil & gas market, served by the industrial
applications division. customers whose activities in the oil & gas industry primarily depend on
profitability, cash, and return on investment may decide to postpone or even cut capital
expenditures, affecting demand for certain elements of our portfolio such as compressors,
industrial gasturbines,subseaproductsorotherofferings.forexample,beginningin2012,crude
oil prices saw a steep decline up until 2016, falling from average monthly prices of over usd 100
per barrel (“bbl”) of crude oil (brent) to below average monthly usd 50/bbl of crude oil (source:
rystad, “servicedemandcube” database, retrieved in august 2020). this decline strongly
impacted market volumes mainly during the 2016-2017 period. according to rystad (source:
rystad, “how will low oil prices and covid-19 impact the energy supply chain”, april 8, 2020),
weighted average cost compression in the upstream market experienced a decline of around
37% between 2014 and 2017 due to such oil price changes. operating expenditure is less volatile
withrespecttooilpricevolatilitycomparedtocapitalexpenditure.
certain countries that are heavily dependenton income from oil and gasmaycurtail investments
in capital intensive oil & gas projects as well as power generation and transmission projects
during periods of long-term low or expected low demand for oil and gas due to insufficient
funds. this in turn could lead to less demand for certain of our gas and power segment’s
products, solutions and services, in particular for large projects in the transmission and the
generationdivisions.
generally, market environments characterized by long-term low oil and gas prices may prompt
some of our customers to shift their expenditure towards solutions and services that increase
operational efficiency. for example, during the oil price downturn of 2016, the oil & gas industry
experienced a strong push to higher operational efficiency and cost adjustment which enabled
market recovery. this may in turn increase demand for siemens energy’s industrial applications
offeringsaddressingsuchcustomerneeds.
fortheabovereasons(see “9.4.2 globaleconomicandgeopoliticalconditions”),webelievethat
our services business shows resilience against adverse changes in oil and gas prices. furthermore,
we are active in the downstream segment of the oil & gas industry and other process industries
suchasfiber, chemical, ormarineindustriesthatarelessaffectedorevenbenefitfromlowprices
113
for feedstock. in addition, services for the distributed and industrial power generation industries
arealsogenerallylessaffectedbylong-termlowoilandgasprices.
moreover, while long-term low or volatile oil and gas prices may put short-term pressure on
power generation from renewables, they have shifted spending in the overall energy market to
otherenergysources,inparticularrenewables,whichhasledtoincreasedordersfortheoffering
of our sgre segment or sustainable power generation offerings from our gas and power
segment and this trend may continue in the future during long periods of low or volatile oil and
gas prices. this is reflected in the positive order backlog development of sgre over the past
threeyears(see“9.4.4highrevenuevisibilityfromorderbacklog”).
9.4.2.2 effectsofthecovid-19pandemicandtheoilpricedropinearly2020
during the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, our business was adversely affected by
covid-19aswellasbyitsimpactontheeconomicenvironment,ourcustomersandsuppliers.the
impact of covid-19 on our business varied between countries, regions and even cities and
communities. primarily, we faced a decline in demand, shifted and cancelled order awards,
restricted access to customer sites, reduced capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities
duetolockdownsorotherformsofrestrictions,delayedprojectexecutionandservicesleadingto
additional costs, and challenges in certain segments of our supply chain. with regard to specific
segments of our supply chain, we experienced longer lead times. a significant challenge for our
supplychainwastheshortageoffreightservices,leadingtohigherfreightcosts.
impact from covid-19 was most pronounced in march and april of 2020. during these months,
government lockdowns and quarantines imposed on parts of our gas and power segment’s
workforcemainlyaffectedourmanufacturingfacilities andalsorepairworkshops,e.g.,infrance,
india and italy aswell astoalesser degreein canadaandcolombia. reducedcapacity utilization
resulted in significant underabsorption of fixed costs. to mitigate the impact of covid-19, we
implemented flexible working models, re-routed manufacturing to less impacted facilities and
also temporary increased loads in such facilities. the transmission division of our gas and power
segment was less affected by lockdown and mandatory closure of sites as some of its
manufacturing facilities were deemed system critical and thus exempted from measures imposed
by authorities to mitigate the effects from the covid-19 pandemic. however, the transmission
division experienced a high level of project shifts during march and april 2020, leading to a
declineinrevenueandunderabsorptionoffixedcosts.theprojectbusinessofourgasandpower
segment was particularly impacted by hindrances to send personnel on our customers’ sites. the
service business in particular of our generation division and, to a certain extent, of our industrial
applications division was adversely affected by travel bans hindering us to send our service
personnel on site, which led to a loss of productivity and revenue. furthermore, some customer
sites were partially or fully closed down. in addition, the service business of our industrial
applications division was negatively affected by the closures of service shops. at the same time,
we saw demand for technical risk assessments from customers whose equipment was operating
beyond recommended service intervals. we also switched to remote diagnostics services. in our
generation division, scheduled outages were shifted. as part of our mitigation efforts, we
switchedtoremotesupportserviceswhereverpossible.despitecovid-19,duringthenine-month
period ended june 30, 2020, only a limited number of scheduled outages were shifted or
cancelled.
from may 2020 onwards, the situation also improved in our gas and power segment. however,
while most of our impacted manufacturing facilities reopened and are running on high loads
again, a significant number of customer sites are still either closed or ramping up only slowly.
with regard to scheduled outages, the situation also improved, with less scheduled outages
beingshiftedtolaterperiods.
our sgre segment, mainly its onshore wind turbine business, was also impacted by temporary
government lockdowns of manufacturing facilities, e.g., in china, india and spain. the segment’s
supply chain was mainly impacted by shortages of supply of components and raw materials such
asbalsawood,whichtoobtainhadalreadybeenchallenginginthefirstquarterofthefiscalyear
114
2020. supply chain challenges also contributed to reduced capacity utilization of manufacturing
facilities and declines in productivity, which resulted in underabsorption of fixed costs. in the
onshore wind turbine business, the impact of covid-19 contributed to delays in the execution of
projects in northern europe and to the continuing slow-down of the indian market, contributing
to a decline in revenue from this business and resulting in additional costs. orders were shifted
into later periods, also attributable to delayed contract signings. delays in project execution led
to customer claims for damages. the offshore wind turbine business and the service business was
less impacted by covid-19. declines in orders and revenue in the offshore wind turbine business
were in line with pre-covid-19 expectations due to market-specific volatility after strong orders
inthefirstquarterofthefiscalyear2020.tomitigatetheimpactofcovid-19,thesgresegment
organized teams to ensure business continuity, partly by leveraging the group’s worldwide
footprinttorecoverlostmanufacturingcapacityandmitigatechallengesinspecificmarkets.
in our sgre segment, already at the end of the second quarter of the fiscal year 2020, the
segment’s chinese manufacturing facilities resumed normal operations, while manufacturing
facilities in spain resumed their operations in may 2020. in india, operations continued to be
impactedinthethirdquarterofthefiscalyear2020.
forinformationontheeffectsofcovid-19andassociatedrisksseealso“3.1.3ourindustriesand
business operations are subject to various risks relating to global or local outbreaks of infectious
diseases and other public health crises. in particular, we are affected from the fallout of the
outbreakoftherecentcoronaviruspandemic.”.
moreover, in early 2020, oil prices dropped sharply due to demand contraction caused by the
impact of the covid-19 pandemic and simultaneous high oversupply volumes. this resulted in
adverse effects on our business, in particular on the industrial applications division’s oil & gas
industry business. oil companies announced significant cuts to their capital expenditures, which,
together with covid-19, affected demand particularly for the offering of our industrial
applications division, in particular in the upstream and midstream segment of the oil & gas
industry.
in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, covid-19, among other factors, contributed to a
decrease of total revenue in the sgre segment while total revenue of the gas and power
segmentremainednearlyflat whencomparedwith total revenuein thesameperiodofthefiscal
year 2019. in the gas and power segment, the transmission division was affected the most,
mainly due to project shifts and cancellations but could level total revenue with the prior year
period. the generation division’s revenue slightly declined from the level of the nine-month
period ended june 30, 2019, also impacted by covid-19. the industrial applications division saw
moderatelyincreasingtotalrevenueperiod-over-periodduetoastrongnewunitbusiness,driven
by high orders in the previous periods, while the division’s revenue from service was stable. in
our sgre segment, covid-19 exacerbated the slow-down of the indian market and contributed
to the delay of certain projects in northern europe, leading, among others, to a decline of
revenue of the segment’s onshore business. the sgre segment’s revenue from the offshore
business saw substantial decrease in revenue in line with project execution planning. growth of
the segment’s service business was partly driven by the acquisition of senvion assets (see
“9.4.8.4acquisitionofsenviongroupassets”).
we believe that, for the reasons described under “9.4.2 global economic and geopolitical
conditions”, in particular the strong contribution of the service business of our gas and power
segment’s generation and industrial applications divisions to revenue and profitability (see
“9.4.4highrevenuevisibilityfromorderbacklog”and“9.4.5.2recurringprofitablerevenuefrom
our service business”), and additional reasons primarily relating to the specific offerings of our
segments, divisions and specific characteristics of their markets, our business shows resilience
against the short- to mid-term effects of the covid-19 pandemic and the oil price drop in early
2020. for our expectations with regard to the effects of covid-19 and the oil price drop in early

9.4.2.3 geopoliticalconditions
with respect to geopolitical conditions, our results of operations may, among other factors, be
affected by the imposition of new trade barriers or sanctions which may prohibit us from doing
business in certain countries, including execution of our order backlog, as happened due to the
imposition of sanctions by the united states on iran in 2018. for further information on
geopolitical conditions affecting our results of operations, see “3.1.6 political instability,
international conflicts ornewtradebarriersmayhaveanegativeeffectonourbusiness,financial
positionandresultsofoperations.”.
9.4.3 competition
our results are also affected by competition in the markets in which we are active. the intensity
of competition we face and, consequently, the impact on our results of operations, differ among
therelevantmarkets.
in thetransmission division ofourgasandpowersegment, thecompetitor landscapeiscomplex.
apart from some large global players, there are many small companies typically specialized in
particular market segments and concentrated on specific regions. for certain parts of the
transmission solutions business, such as the large high-voltage direct current (“hvdc”) or grid
access projects within our solutions business, we face a limited number of strong global
competitors. however, as capacities for these projects in the industry have generally been
limited, the impact of competition on prices for large hvdc or grid access projects has been less
pronounced. in the future, we expect new competitors to emerge, specifically from the asia,
australia region which could lead to increasing price pressure in our large projects business as
well. in our transmission division’s service business, we face several smaller local independent
service providers with (in many cases) aggressive pricing strategies, multi-brand service offerings,
lean set-ups and low cost structures. for more information, see “11.2.3 competitive
environment”.
thegenerationdivision ofourgasandpowersegmentisfacingintensecompetitionfromstrong
establishedcompetitors,othercompaniesactiveinourindustriesandcompetitorsfromemerging
markets, which were previously active locally but are increasingly entering global markets. in the
relevant markets we also face competition from new industries, which may have more
competitive offerings, bothintermsofsophistication andcoststructure. pricingpressureexistsas
market participants often undertake pricing strategies that are specifically aimed at gaining or
protecting market share and increasing the utilization of production capacity. competition is
particularly intense in times of declining demand or overcapacities in the market as competitors,
in order to retain or increase utilization of production capacity, are tempted to support their
sales volumes by lowering prices (or refrain from adjusting their prices to increased cost of sales).
for example, especially the large gas turbine market experienced years of continuous price
decline due to intense competition and overcapacities among original equipment manufacturers
(“oem”) and engineering, procurement and construction (“epc”) contractors, resulting in strong
price pressure. overcapacity among oems and epc contractors has led to market consolidation in
recent years, which also affected the intensity of competition. competing in such market
environments may lead to lower revenues or depress margins. for more information, see
“11.3.3competitiveenvironment”.
the competitor landscape in our industrial applications division’s markets is complex. most
companies typically specialize in particular market segments, but there are only a few companies
that are present across several value chain segments. in the service business, we compete mainly
with independent service providers as well as with other regional and local players. for several
products, we also face competition regarding service activities from other oems. for more
information,see“11.4.3competitiveenvironment”.
due to the system-critical nature of many of our products and solutions it is of major importance
to our customers, particularly in the generation and industrial applications division of our gas
and power segment, that their equipment be reliable. oems such as siemens energy are
generally in a better position to service their own branded equipment and this expertise enables
116
us to service a large share of our installed fleet, even when customers have their own
maintenance personnel (see also “9.4.5.2 recurring profitable revenue from our service
business” below). although we also experience competition from other oem and non-oem
service providers in our service business, especially in the generation and industrial applications
divisions, we are able to mitigate the impact by productivity measures taking effect during the
lifetimeofourlong-termservicecontracts.
the competitive situation for our sgre segment differs in the three market segments, onshore,
offshore and service. the sgre segment competes with international oems, chinese oems and
other regional oems, with chinese oems and other regional oems primarily focused on their
local markets. the market for onshore wind turbines is more fragmented although consolidation
in the segment has increased concentration of market shares outside china. in the offshore wind
energy market there is a lower number of competitors due to the relatively high entry barriers
but competition with regard to wind turbine prices is also strong and influenced by the
introduction of auction mechanisms. consolidation is moving forward in both on- and offshore
markets and is driven by market players striving for scale to address technological challenges,
which increase development costs, and market accessibility challenges. however, major
international oems have communicated a pricing stabilization during recent quarters. it is to be
expected that the trend towards increasing nameplate (i.e., nominal) capacity as well as blade
size andrelatedcompetition will also continuein thecoming years, furtherresultinginincreased
challenges relating to the manufacturing and logistics. the service business of the wind energy
market is mainly served by oems, however also by independent service providers and an
increasing share of customers are insourcing operation & maintenance (“o&m”) activities. these
are mainly large utilities with a significant installed fleet size. in the rapidly changing market
environment of the wind energy industry, most owners expand their fleets beyond a single
turbinemanufacturer, either duetoeconomic orperformance-relatedconsiderations,orthrough
theintegration offleets resulting from mergers &acquisitions activities. this results inchallenges
for service providers such as sgre (and for owners as well). for more information, see
“11.5.4competitiveenvironment”.
9.4.4 highrevenuevisibilityfromorderbacklog
our ability to generate revenues depends on orders for our products, solutions and services. our
large order backlog gives us high visibility of future revenues as many of our orders relate to a
multi-year project business, ofteninvolving highvolumes, andservicebusinesswithstretchedout
revenuerecognition (onourservice business, seealso “9.4.5.2 recurring profitablerevenuefrom
our service business”). due to multi-year projects in our solutions business, we have a high level
of visibility on future revenues. in our service business, existing long-lasting service contracts and

orderbacklogasofjune30,2019.
over the fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, order backlog of siemens energy increased at a
compound annual growth rate (“cagr”) of 4.9%. we believe our high volume of orders over
the periods presented (for detailed discussions, see “9.7.2.1 orders”, “9.7.3.1 orders” and
“9.7.4.1 orders”)leadingtoourorderbacklogof€82billionasofjune30,2020,givesusasolid
basis for future sustainable revenue generation. in the fiscal years 2019 and 2018, we were able
to record a robust book-to-bill ratio of above 1, with 1.2 in the fiscal year 2019 and 1.1 in the
fiscal year 2018. the book-to-bill ratio above 1 from 2018 onwards demonstrates that we were
able to increase orders ahead of revenue and thus our order backlog. in the fiscal year 2019,
especially large orders of our transmission and generation divisions in our gas and power
segment contributed to this development (see “9.7.3.1 orders”). in the fiscal year 2018, the
book-to-bill ratio above 1 was largely attributable to our sgre segment, where portfolio effects
of the merger had a stronger impact on orders than on revenue. moreover, our sgre segment’s
orders in the fiscal year 2018 included a contract for an offshore wind power plant, including
service,intheunitedkingdomworthabout€1.3billion(see“9.7.4.1orders”).
our orders and order backlog form the basis of future sustainable revenue generation.
therefore,thenumberoflargeordersweareabletowindirectlyaffectstheshort-andmid-term
reliability and solidity of our revenue levels. in any given reporting period, orders for large
projects may depend on our own abilities to successfully bid for projects and project-specific
factors such as the granting of permits required for a specific project and availability of funding.
certain large projects have however induced volatility to our orders or revenue levels and may
continuetodosointhefuture.forexample,thegasandpowersegmentrecognizedcomparably
high revenue in the fiscal year 2017 from the execution of the project in egypt (see
“9.4.5.1 project business”). with regard to orders, a significant increase in orders of the sgre
segment in the fiscal year 2019 and the nine-month period endedjune 30, 2020 was attributable
to orders in connection with the construction of an offshore wind power nacelle assembly in
taiwan. the latter will also include testing, warehousing and office facilities. production start is
planned for 2021, supporting specifically ørsted’s 900 mw “greater changhua” 1 & 2a project,
119
for which the sg 8.0–167 dd turbine will be used, as well as the increasing business in the asia,
australia region. the order volume of the “greater changhua” project is € 1.2 billion, including
€50millionservicevolume.
while orders for large projects may lead to volatility in total orders from reporting period to
reporting period, revenue is generally less affected from such volatility due to the fact that large
projects in particular typically have longer development and construction phases and service
ordersoftenrelatetolong-termservicecontractsthatthereforeleadtorevenuerecognitionover
severalreportingperiods.
the backlog-to-revenue ratio of siemens energy was 2.7, 2.5 and 2.3 as of september 30, 2019,
2018 and 2017, respectively. in the gas and power segment, the backlog-to-revenue ratio was
2.8, 2.5 and 2.2 as of september 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and in the sgre segment
2.5,2.5and2.7,respectively.
as of june 30, 2020, we expect to convert approximately € 21 billion (or 26%) of the order
backlog into revenue within the fiscal year2021(thereof gasandpowersegment: approximately
€ 12 billion; sgre segment: approximately € 8 billion). as of september 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017
we expected to convert approximately € 23 billion (or 30%), approximately € 22 billion (or 31%)
and approximately € 21 billion (or 30%), respectively, of the order backlog into revenue within
oneyear(thereofgasandpowersegment:approximately€13billion,approximately€13billion
and approximately € 14 billion, respectively; sgre segment: approximately € 9 billion,
approximately € 9 billion and € 7 billion, respectively). this stable level of order backlog reach
demonstrates that the major part of revenue recognition of the following year was expected to
begeneratedfromorderbacklogandledtoasteadyrevenuedevelopment.
9.4.5 productportfolioandbusinessmix
during any given period, our results of operations are affected by the mix of products, solutions
andservicessoldineachsegment.
we believe that our activities as a supplier of technology along almost the entire energy value
chain in both conventional and renewable energy generation, energy transmission, oil & gas and
other process industries together with the broad products, solutions and services portfolio add
resiliencetoourbusiness.
because profitability levels differ significantly among our products, solutions or services, our
revenue and profit sources and levels depend on the business mix in a reporting period (for our
project business, see “9.4.5.1 project business”). with regard to revenue mix, from the fiscal year
2017 to the fiscal year 2019, total revenue of the gas and power segment declined at a cagr of
8.3% whereas total revenue of the sgre segment increased at a cagr of 13.6%. while the
decline of total revenue of the gas and power segment was also attributable to high revenue
recognized from the execution of the project in egypt (“9.4.5.1 project business”) in the fiscal
year2017andthesgresegmentprofitedfromthemergerthatledtotheformationofsgres.a.
in the fiscal year 2017 (see “9.4.8.1 merger of gamesa and siemens wind power into sgre and
acquisition of iberdrola’s 8.1% shareholding in sgre”), these developments shifted revenue
contribution of the gas and power segment and the sgre segment from 73.7% and 26.3% of
total revenue of total segments in the fiscal year 2017 to 64.7% and 35.3% in the fiscal year
2019,respectively.

for an overview of our service business, see “9.4.5.2 recurring profitable revenue from our
servicebusiness”below.
9.4.5.1 projectbusiness
in our project business, our ability to win orders may not only affect our revenue mix (see also
“9.4.4 high revenue visibility from order backlog”) but also our profitability as margins may
vary from market to market and from project to project. for example, in our sgre segment,
revenue mix and margins may vary depending on the mix of onshore and offshore projects. in
the fiscal year 2017, the onshore wind turbine market declined, leading to a decrease in revenue
from such market, while at the same time, revenue from the offshore wind turbine market
increased. in the fiscal year 2018, the onshore wind turbine market recovered, leading to higher
orders. at the same time, prices in the onshore wind turbine market declined, leading to a
contraction of margins. when compared to the onshore wind turbine business, in the case of
sgre, the offshore wind turbine business is generally characterized by higher margins. this was
evident in the fiscal year 2019, when, despite year-on-year revenue increase, adjusted ebita of
the sgre segment remained nearly at the level of the fiscal year 2018, among other factors due
toalessfavorableprojectmixbecauseofahighervolumeoflowermarginonshoreprojects.
the execution of large orders can also have substantial effects on the volatility of our revenue.
for example, in the fiscal year 2018, as part of siemens, we completed the construction of the
world’s three largest combined-cycle power plants (“ccpps”) in beni suef, el burullus and new
capital, egypt, in collaboration with the egyptian ministry of electricity and renewable energy
and consortium partners orascom construction and elsewedy electric. this project added an
aggregate power output of up to 14.4 gigawatt (“gw”) to egypt’s grid and involved the
installation of 24 h-class gas turbines, 12 steam turbines, 36 generators and three 500 kv
gas-insulated switchgears and six substations to transmit the electricity generated in egypt’s
transmission system. moreover, siemens energy signed long-term service contracts for all three
power plants and subsequent solution contracts in connection to the three power plants. this
project in egypt has been one of the largest contracts in the history of siemens energy’s business
with an initial order volume of about € 3.7 billion, excluding service and subsequent contracts.
construction began in 2015 and more than one-third of revenue for this project was recognized
inthefiscalyear2017,anamountwhichhalvedin2018andagainhalvedin2019.theamountof
service orders recognized for the project in egypt amounted to well above € 1 billion, mostly
recordedinthefiscalyear2016.
in both segments, the profitability of our project business also depends on timely project
execution according to plan. our project business also comprises projects with fixed prices.
deviations from budgeted costs can result in negative project margins if costs are not fully
covered by escalation clauses in our contracts or our project management is not able to mitigate
higher costs by change requests in the course of the project. conversely, we can also experience
margin upsides, for instance if actual costs turn out to be lower during project execution than
initially estimated in project budgeting or supplier contracts can be renegotiated. we are
addressing such topics with a continuous risk and opportunities management prior and during
project execution. the runtime of our projects can be several months or even years and we need
to cope with unforeseen events or changes in conditions, leading to cost overruns,
non-conformance costs or delays. these can have multiple reasons (which are partly beyond our
control) as we are depending on variables such as environmental conditions at our construction
122
sites or undisrupted supply chains (see also “3.1.9 extreme weather conditions due to climate
change may have a negative effect on our business.”). our contracts mayinclude penaltyclauses,
like for project delays or performance obligations, which can have a material adverse effect on
our project results, if materialization cannot be avoided. such risks may partially be covered by
risk contingencies or increases of planned costs, which are set up during the runtime of a project
with negative effect on project profitability (for information on provisions for order related
losses and risks, see also note 15 to the audited combined financial statements). in turn, the
release of these risk contingencies or if planned costs do not materialize lead to a positive
one-timeeffect.afterprojectfinalization,risksareusuallycoveredbywarrantyprovisions,setup
according to past experience. despite being targeted at straightening project revenues and
project profits over time, it is inherent to the percentage of completion (poc) accounting for our
large projects that positive or negative deviations from budgeted project results have an
influence in line with the stage of completion. this may lead to aperiodic, cumulative effects,
shown in the period the effect is recognized. such aperiodic effects impact the comparability of
our results of operations and financial position between the reporting periods. in addition,
declining demand for large projects may affect profitability if we are not able to utilize our
capacitiesandahigherproportionoffixedcostscannotbeabsorbedbyongoingprojects.
9.4.5.2 recurringprofitablerevenuefromourservicebusiness
our results of operations and margins depend to a significant degree on our ability to generate
revenue from servicing our large installed fleet as it becomes subject to wear and tear, in
particular for rotating equipment of the gas and power segment’s generation and industrial
applications divisions and of the sgre segment. overall, the share of total segments’ total
revenue from service of total segments’ total revenue was 33.0% in the fiscal year 2019 (fiscal
year 2018: 32.2%; fiscal year 2017: 29.6%). over the fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, total
segments’ total revenue from service increased at a cagr of 3.5%. our service business typically
has higher margins than the new units businesses. therefore, the share of our service business
withinourrevenuemixalsoaffectsouroverallprofitability.
since the equipment in our installed fleet often has a long lifespan, maintaining and expanding
our large installed fleet and securing orders for servicing contracts, in particular for long-term
service programs, enables us to generate recurring profitable revenue. long-term service
contracts typically stretch over approximately 12 and 9 years in our gas and power segment and
oursgresegment,respectively.
in our gas and power segment, the service business of our generation division comprises
transactional and contractual business models for servicing of gas turbines, steam turbines,
generators, i&c, auxiliaries, andall associated equipmentthroughoutpowerplants in centralized
power generation. the generation division had more than 11,000 service-relevant gas and steam
turbines, generators and engines as of june 30, 2020. the majority of its service business is based
onlong-termprogramsaswellaso&m,resultinginrecurringrevenuefromindividualcustomers.
the industrial applications division had a service-relevant oil & gas fleet of more than 79,000
units as of june 30, 2020, mostly comprised of gas turbines, steam turbines, compressors and
generators. while a large share of the industrial applications division’s service business is
transactional and covers spare parts, repairs, overhauls and field services, many customers sign
multi-year service contracts, which provide recurring revenue from individual customers.
compared to the more complex rotating equipment of the generation and industrial
applications divisions, the transmission division’s products are less service-intensive. we believe
that, across our divisions, our broad customer base across different market segments contributes
to the resilience of the gas and power segment’s service businesses. in total, the gas and power
segmenthadmorethan90,000service-relevantunitsasofjune30,2020initsinstalledfleet.
the gas and power segment had a service share of 41.7% of its total revenue in the nine-month
period ended june 30, 2020 and of 42.4% of its total revenue in the fiscal year 2019. the service
shareincreased overtheperiodspresented(fiscal year2018:40.2%; fiscal year: 2017:35.0%).the
share of the service business of the generation and industrial applications divisions was
123
approximately 51% and approximately 60% of their respective total new unit and service
revenue (including intercompany service business) in the fiscal year 2019, while the transmission
division showed a lower service share of approximately 8% of its total new unit and service
revenue.
as of june 30, 2020, the sgre segment had roughly 32,000 serviced turbines worldwide, with
more than 72 gw under maintenance. sgre offers a wide range of services from maintenance
and repair services over upgrades to extend the life of an asset and overhaul services, offshore
logistics services, blade services and remote diagnostics to asset management services. the sgre
segment had a service share of 18.5% of its total revenue in the nine-month period ended
june 30, 2020 and of 15.8% of its total revenue in the fiscal year 2019. the service share slightly

9) in fiscal year 2019, the division’s share of service revenue for transmission, generation and industrial applications was
approximately 8%, 51% and 60%, respectively. the shares include intercompany service business and are calculated by
dividingtherespectiveservicerevenue(totalrevenue)bydivisionbythetotaloftheservicerevenue(totalrevenue)andnew

thegasandpowersegment’s service business contributed 83.1%andthesgresegment’s service
business contributed 16.9% to total segments’ total revenue from service in the fiscal year 2019,
respectively.
total segments’ order backlog included a service share of 58.5% as of june 30, 2020 and of
61.0%,62.0%and60.0%asofseptember30,2019,2018and2017,respectively.thesegmentgas

ofseptember30,2019,2018and2017,respectively.
total segments’ backlog-to-revenue ratio from service was 4.9, 4.9 and 4.7 as of september 30,
2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. in the gas and power segment, the backlog-to-revenue ratio

because we service a large share of our installed fleet of often mission-critical units with
considerable lifespans, our service business generally shows high level of resilience towards
adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions (see “9.4.2 global economic and geopolitical
conditions”). we therefore believe that recurring revenue from our service business offers
strengthtoourbusiness.
9.4.6 technologicalinnovation,researchanddevelopment
our revenue is driven by our ability to provide innovative products, integrated systems, solutions
andservicesanddevelopdeeprelationshipswithcustomersandprojectpartners.webelievethat
sustainable economic value is created through continuous innovation and that investment in
researchanddevelopment(“r&d”)isfundamentaltooursuccess.
westeerallr&dactivitiesofthegasandpowersegmenttobestaddressthechallengesposedby
whatwebelievetobethemarket-definingmegatrends:growingenergyandelectricitydemand,
decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization. recent development highlights include
topsides 4.0, the hl-class turbines, switchgears without sulphur hexafluoride (“sf ”), increasing
6
hydrogenco-firingcapabilitiesofourturbinefleetandindustrial-scaleelectrolyzers.
r&d activities in our transmission division focus on developing products and solutions that help
to increase the transient and dynamic stability of electrical grids, while improving the overall
transmission capacity, quality, reliability, availability and environmental compatibility. r&d
activities in our generation division focus on the development of new products and the
improvement of existing products, such as the advanced air-cooled 9000hl gas turbine product
line with efficiencies over 63% in combined-cycle applications. in the fiscal year 2018, the
generation division also sold the first units of our largest gas turbine model sgt-9000hl,
126
including a large solution order worth about € 0.3 billion in the united kingdom (“uk”), that
reaches efficiencies beyond 63% in combined-cycle applications and is suitable for centralized,
large-scale power generation application. r&d activities in our industrial applications division
focus on developing technologies that support decarbonization. this includes addressing the
dimensions of our compression solutions, increasing efficiency in all our rotating equipment,
reducing emissions in our gas turbine product lines. further, our industrial applications division
develops novel compression applications for cleaner gases in order to drive the decarbonization
of various industries. r&d activities of the generation and industrial applications businesses
concentrate on developing products and solutions for enhancing efficiency and flexibility and
reducing ghg emissions, in particular by increasing the hydrogen co-firing capabilities of our gas
turbines. our gas and power segment is also intensifying r&d in innovative materials, advanced
manufacturing methods (3d printing) and plant optimization. innovations accordingly focus on
product digitalization, power electronics, software-driven power control, environmentally-
friendly products and systems, and grid stabilization. r&d activities in our new energy business
are aimed at supporting the transition towards a decarbonized world with electro-chemical
solutions, including optimization of “power-to-hydrogen” plans and “power to-x” solutions.
investments in the gas and power segment in the periods presented focused on enhancing the
generationandindustrial applications divisions’ productivity throughautomationandincreasing
customer proximity via strategic localization of capacity. investing activities mainly related to our
gas turbines and turbine components. for more information on the gas and power segment’s
r&dactivities,see“12.3.11r&d”.
together with various research partners, our sgre segment is developing new wind power
technologies with a view to increase both power and performance. furthermore, the segment
focuses on new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. the sgre
segment focused its investments on production equipment for new blade types and capacity
expansion in its factories. for more information on the sgre segment’s r&d activities, see
“12.4.4r&d”.
our r&d efforts not only affect our ability to generate future revenue but also our profitability.
in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, our research and development expenses
amounted to € 689 million (or 3.5% of our revenue) (nine-month period ended june 30, 2019:
€ 683 million (or 3.3% of our revenue)). our capitalized development expenses (additions to
internally generated technology) amounted to € 141 million in the nine-month period ended
june30,2020(nine-monthperiodendedjune30,2019:€124million).
in the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, our research and development expenses amounted to
€ 1,001 million (3.5% of our revenue), to € 1,069 million (3.8% of our revenue) and to
€ 1,111 million (3.7% of our revenue), respectively. in the fiscal year 2019, our capitalized
research and development expenses (shown as additions to internally generated technology in

9.4.7 geographicalmixofrevenue
our revenue is also affected by our geographic mix. the following table shows the revenue of
siemens energy by location of customer for the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, as well as for

over the periods presented, contributions by the emea, americas and asia, australia regions
remained largely stable. certain levels of variation in our geographical mix of revenue over time
are generally induced by, among other factors, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, the
product mix in any given period, e.g., execution of large orders in our project business for new
units may induce a certain level of volatility in our results in specific regions, and changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, which affect our customers spending decisions. in addition, we
generally sell our entire portfolio across all regions, resulting in a balanced geographic product
mix that further contributes to resiliency and also balanced pricing and margin variations by
region. for our geographical mix of revenue, foreign currency exchange rates, in particular
exchange rates of the relevant customer’s national currency against the u.s. dollar, play a major
role as they affect our customers’ capital expenditures decisions and therefore also demand for
ourofferingsfromtherelevantregions.
we believe that, on the group-level, our mix of revenue by geographic region helps mitigate
revenue volatility in specific regions. for example, in the fiscal year 2019, revenue in the emea
region and the americas increased by 5.9% and 5.5%, respectively, compensating a decrease of
revenue in the asia, australia region, where revenue fell by 9.9%. in addition, revenue
contributions of our two reportable segments in specific regions from time to time have been
subject to opposing trends, mitigating the overall effect on the group-level. for example, in the
128
fiscal year 2019, substantial revenue growth in the sgre segment more than offset a decline in
revenues of the gas and power segment in the emea region while in the americas region, an
increase in revenue in the gas and power segment offset a clear decline in revenue in the sgre
segment.
9.4.8 sgremerger;acquisitionsanddisposals
our results of operations are affected by acquisitions and disposals of certain businesses. in the
periodspresented,thefollowingmaterialacquisitionsanddisposalsoccurred:
9.4.8.1 merger of gamesa and siemens wind power into sgre and acquisition of iberdrola’s
8.1%shareholdinginsgre
in april 2017, siemens contributed its wind power business, including services, into the publicly
listed company gamesa corporación tecnológica, s. a., spain (“gamesa”). the consideration
transferred by siemens equaled 59% of gamesa’s market capitalization at closing of the merger
andamountedto€3,669million.inreturnforsuchconsideration,siemensreceivednewlyissued
shares corresponding to approximately 59% in the combined entity siemens gamesa renewable
energy, s. a., spain. as part of the merger, siemens paid € 999 million in cash which was
distributed to the gamesa shareholders (without siemens) following the completion of the
merger. the merger resulted in goodwill of € 2,857 million as of the acquisition date april 3,
2017, and comprised intangible assets that are not separable such as employee know-how and
expected synergy effects from highly complementary businesses entailing an enhanced market
position (including anticipated cost savings mainly in r&d, procurement and administration as
well as revenue synergies). sgre’s activities linked to the post-merger integration of gamesa and
siemens’ wind power business and operational improvement measures are still ongoing (see
“9.4.10integrationandoperationalimprovementmeasures;specialitems”).
following the merger, siemens as a majority shareholder held 59% of the shares in sgre s.a.
until siemens ag’s acquisition of the 8.1% non-controlling interest in sgre from iberdrola s.a.
for a purchase price of € 1.1 billion in february 2020. in the carve-out, siemens ag transferred
itsshareholdingstosiemensenergy,whichholdsapproximately67%ofthesharesinsgres.a.

equivalents. the sale resulted in a gain of € 86 million in the fiscal year 2018 which was
recognized in the line item other operating income and presented in the gas and power
segment.
9.4.8.3 disposalofpartsofthegovernmentbusinessandu.s.navyservicecenters
in april 2018, siemens energy sold part of its government business and u.s. navy service centers
for € 174 million in cash and cash equivalents. the sale resulted in a gain of € 79 million in the
fiscal year 2018 which was recognized in the line item other operating income and presented in
thegasandpowersegment.
9.4.8.4 acquisitionofsenviongroupassets
on october 20, 2019, senvion gmbh i.l. and siemens gamesa renewable energy eólica, s.l.u.
signed an agreement under which siemens gamesa renewable energy eólica, s.l.u. acquired on
january 9, 2020 all shares of senvion deutschland gmbh (senvion european onshore services),
which included the carved-out european onshore service business of senvion and certain
additional assets associated to the business, including certain related intellectual property of
senvion. based on this agreement, on april 30, 2020, siemens gamesa renewable energy, s.a.,
portugal signed an agreement with senvion indústria, s.a., and senvion gmbh i.l. by virtue of
which all the shares of ria blades, s.a., an entity which owns and operates the business of the
129
wind turbine blades production facility in vagos (portugal) and certain additional assets
associatedtosaidbusinesswereacquired.
this acquisition is in line with sgre’s strategy to grow its multibrand service business and its
production capacities and strengthens sgre’s competitive position in europe. theoverall price to
be paid in cash for the shares of senvion deutschland gmbh and ria blades, s.a. amounts to
€200million,subjecttoclosingaccountsconfirmationadjustments.
as of june 30, 2020, the preliminary estimate for the consideration to be transferred amounted
to € 190 million (€ 186 million net of cash acquired). until june 30, 2020, the consideration paid
in accordance with the milestones established in the acquisition agreement amounted to
€182million(€177millionnetofcashacquired).
for more information, see note 2 to the unaudited condensed combined interim financial
statements.
9.4.9 personnelcosts
our results are also affected by personnel costs. during the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017,
personnel costs remained relatively stable. personnel costs (consisting of wages and salaries,
statutory social welfare contributions and expenses for optional support as well as expenses
relating to post-employment benefits as shown in the audited combined financial statements)
amounted to € 7,525 million in the fiscal year 2019, € 7,785 million in the fiscal year 2018 and
€7,663millioninthefiscalyear2017.
9.4.10 integrationandoperationalimprovementmeasures;specialitems
9.4.10.1 restructuringandintegrationmeasuresinourgasandpowersegment
during the periods presented, we carried out restructuring and integration programs, some of
which are still ongoing and may lead to further measures, reflecting siemens energy’s endeavor
to adapt to a changing market environment to improve the competitiveness of our operations
and integrate siemens’ wind power business and gamesa after the merger that led to the
formationofsgres.a.
inourgasandpowersegment,thefollowingprogramswereinitiated(insuccessiontopreceding
measures,whichweresubstantiallycompleted):
(cid:129) in 2017, the gas and power segment initiated the program “pg 2020 efficiency” in order to
counter a negative market development and improve cost structures. it defined measures to
increase efficiency, including headcount measures, which are to date substantially
completed, i.e., by and large the respective severance agreements have been signed. the
respectiveemployeeshavelargelyleftthecompany.
(cid:129) the program “pg 2020 efficiency” was extended as “pg 2020” in 2018 in order to ensure a
sustainable improvement of competitiveness and included measures on the gas and power
segment’s global footprint, sourcing and production capacities, targeting a reduction of
employment positions worldwide. under the program and after consultations a headcount
reduction of globally approximately 6,400 is targeted, thereof approximately 2,300 in
germany. today, the targeted reduction has been substantially completed, i.e., by and large
the respective severance agreements have been signed. related savings are not fully
reflected in the development of personnel costs in the fiscal year 2019 since in parts, the
employees that agreed to an exit will leave siemens energy in the mid-term, depending on
the agreed exit dates, e.g., through early retirement agreements. also savings were partly
compensated by merit increases. the program mainly focused on the generation division of
the gas and power segment. the major part of restructuring costs for this program was
incurred in the fiscal years 2018 and 2019. as part of these measures, siemens energy also
130
sold certain parts of its business, including a site for packaging and service of rotating
equipment in hengelo, netherlands, which resulted in a loss of € 54 million in the fiscal year
2019,pertainingtothegasandpowersegment.
(cid:129) in 2019, the program “gp 2020+” was initiated, focusing on cost structure optimization and
re-sizing of production capacities. under the program and after consultations, a headcount
reduction of globally approximately 2,400 is targeted, thereof approximately 1,100 in
germany.today,thetargetedreductionhasbeenwellprogressedespeciallyingermany,i.e.,
the respective severance agreements have been signed by a large extent. a large part of
restructuring costs for this program were incurred in the fiscal year 2019. in the context of
the carve-out of our business, the focus of the re-sizing of support functions has now
broadened to include also corporate functions (i.e., in addition to business related support
functions), where potential future measures are still being evaluated and remain subject to
consultationwithemployeerepresentatives.
(cid:129) on september 1, 2020, we announced a restructuring of our gas and power segment’s
le havre facilities. the current plan foresees a headcount reduction of approximately 300,
the closure of production activities while keeping certain operations. we estimate to incur
personnel and non-personnel costs of € 70 million to € 100 million associated with the
transformation measures. the announced plan is still subject to change, especially following
theoutcomeofthejuststartednegotiationsasperstatutoryrequirements.
(cid:129) we made a strategic portfolio decision to streamline our offering of aero-derivative gas
turbines. while we will continue to service all types of our aero-derivative gas turbines and
still deliverallaero-derivativegasturbinesthathavealreadybeenordered,wewillovertime
no longer actively market our larger sized aero-derivative gas turbines. for more
information,see“12.3.3.1.2(2)aero-derivativegasturbines”.
as of june 30, 2020, the gas and power segment achieved annual gross cost savings of almost
€ 500 million as compared to the fiscal year 2018. in addition, the programs “pg 2020” and “gp
2020+” are expected to achieve further annual global gross cost savings of at least € 500 million
bytheendoffiscalyear2023ascomparedtothefiscalyear2018.
furthermore, in order to achieve our mid-term targets, our gas and power segment aims for
further global cost savings by the end of fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2018. for
informationonourmid-termtargets,see“22.2outlook”.
to achieve these targets, we are evaluating potential further restructuring and optimization
measures.aspartoftheongoingevaluationprocess,wearecloselyanalyzinghowsuchmeasures
could be designed and what consequences they would have for siemens energy, our customers
and our employees. while the evaluation process may further crystalize already in the near
future, no resolution has been made yet on future measures and these measures are subject to
consultation with employee representatives. also, the findings of this process will be discussed in
therelevantcommittees,whichwillsubsequentlytakeadecision.
if we were to implement a further restructuring and optimization program, we believe that it is
likelytofocusonfootprintoptimization,projectexecutionandfunctionoptimization:
(cid:129) footprint optimization and project execution – main levers are likely going to be (i) a
consolidation of our global footprint including a streamlining of our logistics operations and
an optimization of our factory network aimed at reducing complexity and overcapacities
(supply chain excellence), (ii) an operational improvement focusing on: project management
improvements aimed at significantly reducing non-conformance costs, the simplification of
decision processes and project selectivity, i.e., focusing on projects with attractive return
profiles(projectexcellence),(iii)thecompletionoftheintegrationofdresser-rand,aleading
provider of compressors, steam and gas turbines, acquired in 2015 and (iv) a streamlining of
our portfolio. related to footprint optimization and project execution forming part of the
accelerating impact phase (see “12.2.2 spin-off allows for a step change in operational
performance”), we aim for a minimum target of further annual global gross cost savings in
131
an amount of € 300 million together with the announced restructuring of our gas and
power segment’s le havre facilities by the end of the fiscal year 2023 as compared to the
fiscalyear2018.
(cid:129) function optimization – in the context of the carve-out of our business, the focus of the
re-sizing of support functions within the “gp 2020+” program has now broadened to also
consider corporate functions in addition to business related support functions, where
potential measures are still being evaluated and remain subject to consultation with
employee representatives. we aim for related global savings beyond our targets within our
“gp2020+”program.
in total, our restructuring and optimization programs and the potential further measures
outlined above aim at annual global gross cost savings of around € 700 million by the fiscal year
2021 and are expected to exceed the originally targeted annual global gross cost savings for the
fiscal year 2023 of around € 1 billion by at least € 300 million, compared to the fiscal year 2018.
on the basis of these programs and measures, we target additional annual global gross cost
savings in the low triple digit euro million range by the fiscal year 2025. we believe that the
restructuring costs associated therewith will amount cumulatively to a mid to high triple digit
euro million amount for the fiscal years 2020 to 2023. furthermore, at the time the evaluation
process with respect to the potential restructuring and optimization measures outlined above
crystalizes further, potentially already in the near future, this may lead to additional
restructuring and optimization measures associated with significantly higher expenses and
potentiallysavingsinexcessofourcurrentminimumtargetfortheglobalsavings.

expected to achieve a combined effect of productivity enhancements of more than € 2 billion
and significant working capital improvements by the end of the fiscal year 2020 as compared to
the fiscal year 2017. under the umbrella of “l3ad2020”, among others, the following
restructuringmeasureswereinitiated:
(cid:129) in november 2017, sgre announced a global restructuring plan targeting significant
headcountreductionsin31countries,mainlyspain,denmark,theu.s.andtheu.k.

highly competitive landscape characterized by price pressures affecting the production of
directdriveonshoreturbinesandtheonshorebladeproduction.
(cid:129) furthermore, in november 2019, sgre announced a reorganization program. over a term of
two years, the global white collar staff will be reduced, affecting the wind turbines business
and corporate areas. the implementation approach may vary by country, and shall depend on
the final discussions with employee representatives. so far, the process has been carried out
accordingtosgre’splans.
(cid:129) in the first half of 2020, sgre initiated a restructuring of its indian operations to take account
of the slower-than-expected recovery of the indian wind market and in order to adapt to new
marketprospectsanddynamics.
(cid:129) in june 2020, sgre decided to close the blade factory in aoiz, spain, due to competitiveness
considerations.
132
furthermore, in our sgre segment, we evaluate the implementation of further potential
restructuring and optimization programs. within its new “leap” program, our sgre segment
plans to maintain focus on productivity and asset management and also in operational
excellence. aspartofthat, oursgresegmentwill beconstantlyanalyzingfootprintoptimization

9.4.11 foreigncurrencyexchangerates
due to the global scale of our business and the high level of regionalization of many of our
businesses, our results of operations are affected to a significant extent by foreign currency
exchangeratemovements.therearetransactionalriskswhicharisewhenweandoursubsidiaries
execute transactions in a currency other than our or our subsidiary’s respective functional
currency. the largest project execution, engineering, production and r&d hubs for our business
arelocatedin germany,theu.s., theunitedkingdom,spain, denmarkandchinawhileoursales
are global. this means that while revenue is generated in various currencies, costs are mainly in
euro,u.s.dollar,britishpound,danishkroneandrenminbi.
foreign currency exposure is partly balanced by the purchase of goods, commodities and services
in the respective currencies as well as production and other contributions along the value chain
in local markets. we seek to manage transaction exposure resulting from contractual
commitments as well as planned transactions in foreign currencies so that at least 75% but no
more than 100% of the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged.if applicable, for suchhedging
transactions, hedge accounting is used to reduce earnings volatility. however, changes in
currency exchange rates cannot generally be predicted and cannot always be hedged on
economically reasonable terms, and there can be no assurance that our hedging and other risk
mitigation strategies will always be successful in mitigating currency risks. if we are unable to
match sales revenue generated in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, our
results of operations may be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. in case of
unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations, we may be able to offer our products only at
comparatively higher prices or lower profit margins. this currency-related competitive
disadvantagecanleadtoadeclineinrevenueoralowerprofitmarginatsiemensenergy.
we are also subject to translation exposure because we present our combined financial
statements in euro,butmanyofthecompany’ssubsidiaries arelocatedoutsidetheeurozone.as
a result, in the preparation of our combined financial statements, we must translate assets,
liabilities, revenue and costs of all of our operations with a functional currency other than the
euro into euro. consequently, fluctuations in the applicable foreign currency exchangerates may
increase or decrease the euro value of our non-euro assets, liabilities, revenue and costs, even if
their value has not changed in their local functional currency. we assume that investments in
non-euro operations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous. effects from foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net asset amounts into euro are
reflectedinourcombinedstatementsofchangesininvestedequity.

ifrs 9 – “financial instruments” was adopted as of october 1, 2018 but did not have a material
effect on our financial position. for more information on the effects of the adoption of ifrs 9 –
“financialinstruments”,seenote2totheauditedcombinedfinancialstatements.
as of october 1, 2019, siemens energy retrospectively adopted ifric 23 – “uncertainty over
income tax treatments”, which did not have a material effect on the group’s financial position,
performance or cash flows and is not expected to have any such effect in the future. for more
information on the application of ifric 23 – “uncertainty over income tax treatments”, see

in january 2016, the iasb issued ifrs 16 – “leases” (“ifrs 16”). ifrs 16 eliminates the current
classification model for lessee’s lease contracts as either operating or finance leases and, instead,
introduces a single lessee accounting model requiring lessees torecognizeright-of-use assets and
lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months. this brings the previous
off-balance leases on the balance sheet in a manner largely comparable to current finance lease
accounting.ifrs16iseffectiveforannualperiodsbeginningonorafterjanuary1,2019.siemens
energy adopted ifrs 16 by applying the modified retrospective approach (using practical and
transition-related expedients), i.e., comparative figures for the preceding year are not adjusted.
ifrs 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model requiring lessees to recognize right-of-use
assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months, unless the
underlying asset is of low value. as of september 30, 2019, finance leases totaled € 39 million
(thereof gas and power segment: € 37 million; sgre segment € 2 million). as of june 30, 2020,
lease liabilities amounted to € 1,204 million (october 1, 2019: € 896 million), thereof gas and
power segment € 598 million (october 1, 2019: € 311 million) and siemens gamesa renewable
energy€606million(october1,2019:€585million).
as of october 1, 2019, right-of-use assets of € 1,003 million were recognized in property, plant
and equipment, generally measured at the amount of the lease liability (in total € 896 million)
adjusted by any prepaid or accrued lease payments. most of the transition effect relates to real
estate leased by siemens energy. the difference between future payment obligations under
operating leases as of september 30, 2019 of € 1,559 million and the gross lease liability as of
october 1, 2019 of € 1,045 million mostly results from the application of transition-related
expedients. for leases between siemens real estate and siemens energy that were to be
transferredduringthefiscalyear2020,noright-of-useassetsandleaseliabilitieswererecognized
priortothetransfer.
135
the future lease payments from leases under the right-of-use model as of october 1, 2019 were
discounted using incremental borrowing rates (weighted average incremental borrowing rate as
ofoctober1,2019:1.7%).
in addition, beginning with the fiscal year 2020, straight-line operating lease expenses were
replaced by depreciation expenses on right-of-use assets and interest expenses on lease liabilities
resulting in an increase of ebitda. with regard to the adjusted (net cash) / net debt to ebitda
ratio, the positive effect on ebitda is more than offset by the increase in adjusted (net cash) /
net debt, resulting ceteris paribus in an increasing ratio. furthermore, applying ifrs 16 resulted
in a deterioration in cash flows from financing activities, an improvement in cash flows from
operatingactivitiesand,accordingly,ceterisparibusanincreaseinfreecashflow.
9.6 definition and discussion of certain financial measures
certain individual line items in the combined statements of income of siemens energy prepared
inaccordancewithifrsaredescribedbelow.
revenue – siemens energy recognizes revenue, when or as control over distinct goods or services
is transferred to the customer, i.e., when the customer is able to direct the use of the transferred
goodsorservicesandobtainssubstantiallyalloftheremainingbenefits,providedacontractwith
enforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst others collectability of consideration is
probable taking into account customer’s creditworthiness. revenue is the transaction price
siemens energy expects to be entitled to. variable consideration is included in the transaction
price if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur once associated
uncertainties are resolved. the amount of variable consideration is calculated by either using the
expected value or the most likely amount depending on which is expected to better predict the
amount of variable consideration. consideration is adjusted for the time value of money if the
period between the transfer of goods or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelve
months and there is a significant financing benefit either to the customer orsiemens energy.if a
contract contains more than one distinct good or service, the transaction price is allocated to
each performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling prices. if stand-alone selling
prices are not observable, siemens energy reasonably estimates those. revenue is recognized for
eachperformanceobligationeitheratapointintimeorovertime.
for sales from construction-type contracts, revenues are recognized over time under the
percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared
to total estimated costs. an expected loss on the contract is recognized as an expense
immediately. payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the
contractualterms.
the percentage-of-completion method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of
the extent of progress towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries
and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. these significant estimates
include total estimated costs, total estimated revenues, contract risks, including technical,
political and regulatory risks, and other judgments. under the percentage-of-completion
method, changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of revenue. in addition,
siemens energy needs to assess whether the contract is expected to continue or whether it is
terminated. in determining whether the continuation or termination of a contract is expected to
be the most likely scenario, all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the contract are
consideredonanindividualbasis.
revenues from services are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the performance
pattern is other than straight-line, as services are provided, i.e., under the
percentage-of-completion method as described above. payment terms are usually 30 days from
thedateofinvoiceissuedaccordingtothecontractualterms.
for the sale of goods, revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods
passes to the buyer, usually upon delivery of the goods. invoices are issued at that point in time
andareusuallypayablewithin30days.
136
cost of sales – our cost of sales mainly includes costs relating to manufacturing of products,
inventories sold as well as services rendered and consist of variable costs, fixed costs and
depreciation and amortization relating primarily to our property, plant and equipment,
internally developed intangible assets and other related costs. our variable cost of sales primarily
consists ofmaterial, labor, freight andcost ofservices purchased.our fixed cost ofsales primarily
consist of manufacturing overheads, salaries, maintenance costs, depreciation of property, plant
andequipmentandrentalandrelatedoverheadcosts.
grossprofit–grossprofitiscalculatedasrevenuelesscostofsales.
research and development expenses – costs of research activities are expensed as incurred. costs
of development activities are capitalized when the recognition criteria in ias 38 are met.
capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment
losseswithanamortizationperiodofgenerallythreetotenyears.
selling and general administrative expenses – selling expenses are expenses that do not increase
the value of manufactured products and services but that are necessary to support and ensure
the sales of these products and services. those expenses primarily consist of salaries paid to our
sales employees, sales commissions paid to our sales employees or third parties, marketing and
advertising costs, bad debt expense and depreciation relating to office equipment, software and
similar assets. general administrative expenses include headquarter functions which are not
allocable to other functions and primarily consist of lease expenses, salaries paid to senior
management, headquarters and other administrative staff as well as ordinary course expenses
payable in respect of auditing, tax, legal and other consulting services in connection with the
day-to-dayoperationofourbusiness.
other operating income and other operating expenses – represents other operating income,
which includes, among others, gains from the sale of businesses and disposal of assets, and other
operatingexpenses,which includes lossesondisposalofassets,transactioncostsandeffectsfrom
legalandregulatorymatters.
income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method, net – this item is used to
recognize the share of profit or loss in associated companies or joint ventures accounted for
using the equity method. other income realized and other expense incurred in connection with
investments accounted for using the equity method, such as gains and losses on the disposal of
suchinvestments,transactioncostsandimpairmentsarealsorecognizedunderthisitem.
financial result – represents the balance of (i) interest income, (ii) interest expenses, and
(iii) otherfinancialincome(expenses),net.thereinincludedareincomeorexpensesforfinancing
purposes, which primarily consist of interest expense on borrowings from siemens group (mainly
included in interest expenses) as well as interest income and expenses on pension-related assets
and liabilities, and income or expenses related to operating business (interest income related to
receivables from customers, from cash allocated to the segments, interest expenses on payables
tosuppliers).
income taxexpenses–taxpositions underrespective local taxlawsandtaxauthorities’ viewscan
be complex and subject to different interpretations of tax payers and local tax authorities.
different interpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax reforms or other tax
legislative procedures may result in additional tax payments for prior years and are taken into
account based on management’s considerations. under the liability method, deferred tax assets
andliabilitiesarerecognizedforfuturetaxconsequencesattributabletodifferencesbetweenthe
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future taxable profit is available, including
income from forecasted operating earnings, the reversal of existing taxable temporary
differences and established tax planning opportunities. as of each period-end, siemens energy
evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets, generally based on five-years projected future
taxable profits. based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future
taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, siemens energy
believes it is probablesiemens energywill realize thebenefits ofthesedeductibledifferences.as
137
future developments are uncertain and partly beyond siemens energy’s control, assumptions are
necessary toestimate futuretaxableprofits aswell astheperiodin which deferredtaxassetswill
recover. estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the
assumption. particularly for the purposes of the combined financial statements, in accordance
with ias 12 – “income taxes”, income taxes are determined using the separate tax return
approach under the assumption that the entities and operations of siemens energy constitute
separate taxable entities. this assumption implies that current and deferred taxes for all
companies and operations and tax groups within siemens energy are calculated separately. the
recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed on this basis. in the combined financial
statements, deferred tax assets were recognized to the extent it is probable that they can be
offset with future taxable income from the respective siemens energy entities. tax receivables
and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards of siemens energy entities and
operations that did not constitute a separate tax payer in previous periods were treated as
contributions or transfers from reserves by shareholders, and are not included in the combined
financial statements of siemens energy. management deems the approach as appropriate
though not necessarily indicative of the tax expenses or income that would result for siemens
energy as a separate group. for further details please also refer to note 6 of our audited
combinedfinancialstatements.

9.7.2.1 orders
during the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, order intake of certain businesses of
siemens energy was affected by the covid-19 pandemic as well as by the oil price development
(“9.4.2.2 effects of the covid-19 pandemic and the oil price drop in early 2020”). in the nine-
month period ended june 30, 2020, orders amounted to € 27,014 million, up by € 2,444 million
or 9.9%, from € 24,570 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2019. this increase was
attributable to the sgre segment, where orders were substantially up, driven by sharply
increased service and offshore orders, including a higher volume from large orders. in the gas
and power segment, orders slightly decreased. total segments’ orders from service clearly
increased in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020 to € 9,308 million, up by € 631 million,
or 7.3%, from € 8,677 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2019. this led to a share of
34.4% of total segments’ orders, slightly below the level of 35.1% in the nine-month period
endedjune30,2019.
based on such order intake, siemens energy reached a book-to-bill ratio in the nine-month

gas and power segment – orders of the gas and power segment decreased slightly from
€ 15,075 million in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2019 by € 178 million or 1.2%, to
€ 14,897 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020. the divisions transmission and

division,beingaffectedbycovid-19andtheoilpricedevelopmentthemost,postedasignificant
decrease of orders, mainly caused by the pandemic, with related order shifts, especially in the
service business, and to a minor extent also caused by cancelations. furthermore, orders of the
industrial applications division in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020 included a lower
volume from large orders when compared with the same period of the fiscal year 2019. overall,

clearly decreased in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020 to € 5,944 million by
140
€ 697 million, or 10.5%, from € 6,641 million in the same period of the preceding fiscal year,
which also was mainly attributable to a significant decrease of orders in the industrial
applications division. this led to a service share of 39.9% of the segment’s total orders in the
nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, clearly below the level of the same period of the
precedingfiscalyear.
orders in the emea region increased slightly, since, among others, the gas and power segment’s
generation division recorded an order for a turnkey ccpp of € 0.4 billion including service in
germany and successful bid for a turnkey construction project of a ccpp with a volume of more
than € 0.2 billion in russia. moreover, the transmission division was awarded orders for
substations worth € 0.2 billion in iraq as well as the first lot of about € 0.2 billion for a large
hvdc converter project in germany. the industrial applications division closed a contract for a
gas-storagesolutioninsaudiarabiainavolumeofabout€0.1billion.theregionasia,australia
was the only region showing significant growth during the nine-month period ended june 30,
2020, among others mainly due to a number of large orders for the generation division,
including two orders in the republic of korea totaling more than € 0.3 billion and an order of
about € 0.2 billion for its service business in taiwan. thus, order intake in the asia, australia
region partially compensated the development in the americas region which posted a significant
decline despite significant growth in the united states. in the americas region, the industrial
applications division in the prior year period recorded a higher volume from large orders in
brazilandfurthersmallerprojectsincanada.

sgre segment – orders of the sgre segment increased from € 9,674 million in the nine-month
period ended june 30, 2019 by € 2,498 million, or 25.8%, to € 12,172 million in the nine-month
period ended june 30, 2020. the impact of the covid-19 pandemic (see “9.4.2.2 effects of the
covid-19 pandemic and the oil price drop in early 2020”) mainly affected the onshore market.
the substantial increase in orders was mainly due to a higher volume from large orders, with
order intake for offshore wind power plant projects including service in taiwan, the united
kingdom, the netherlands, france and germany. despite a large order in brazil and the united
states, order volume for onshore projects was significantly below the prior year level, overall
reflecting the impact of covid-19. among others, this was attributable to delayed contract
signings in all three reporting regions, though mainly in the u.s. as well as in india, where the
marketgenerallysloweddown.overall,onageographicalbasis,orderssharplyroseintheemea

acquired senvion assets and also included the first contracts for senvion technology outside the
scope of the acquisition of senvion assets (see “9.4.8.4 acquisition of senvion group assets”),
namely two multi-year maintenance contracts for wind power plants in australia, as well as
maintenance contracts for two offshore projects in france. this led to a service shareof27.6%of
the segment’s total orders, substantially above 21.0% in the nine-month period ended june 30,
2019.
based on such order intake, the sgre segment reached a book-to-bill ratio in the nine-month
period ended june 30, 2020 of 1.8. as of june 30, 2020, the order backlog was € 32 billion,
benefitting from the acquisition of senvion assets (see “9.4.8.4 acquisition of senvion group
assets”). following the integration of service assets acquired from senvion in january 2020,

9.7.2.2 revenue
during the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, revenue development of siemens energy
was affected by the covid-19 pandemic (see “9.4.2.2 effects of the covid-19 pandemic and the
oil price drop in early 2020”). in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, siemens energy
recognized revenue of € 19,828 million. this was € 675 million, or 3.3%, lower than in the same
period in the fiscal year 2019, in which revenue amounted to € 20,503 million. the decrease was
driven by the sgre segment, while revenue in the gas and power segment was stable period-
over-period. total segments’ revenue from service was nearly stable in the nine-month period
ended june 30, 2020 to € 6,778 million compared to € 6,838 million in the same period of the
fiscal year 2019. this led to a share of 34.0% of total segments’ total revenue, slightly above the
level of the same period in the fiscal year 2019 of 33.2% (see also “9.4.5.2 recurring profitable
revenuefromourservicebusiness”).

gasandpowersegment–totalrevenueofthegasandpowersegmentinthenine-monthperiod
ended june 30, 2020 amounted to € 13,326 million, nearly level with € 13,315 million in the
same period of the fiscal year 2019. in a continuously disruptive and challenging market
environment (see “9.4.1.1 trends impacting the gas and power segment”), the covid-19
pandemic posed an additional considerable impact on the gas and power segment’s revenue
development (see “9.4.2.2 effects of the covid-19 pandemic and the oil price drop in early
2020”) and impacted all divisions. the industrial applications division saw, despite covid-19
effects,amoderaterevenueincreasemainlyduetoastrongproductbusinessdrivenbytheorder
intake of the fiscal year 2019. revenue from the division’s service business remained stable on
prior year’s level. the generation division’s revenue slightly declined from the level of the nine-
month period ended june 30, 2019, also impacted by covid-19. the highest influence from the
pandemic was seen in the transmission division due to delays or shifts of projects as well as
lockdowns or quarantines in factories, despite that, the transmission division’s revenue could
level with the prior year period. the gas and power segment’s service revenue slightly decreased
in the nine-month period endedjune30,2020by€119million, or2.1%, to€5,552million from
€ 5,671 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2019. this led to a service share of 41.7% of
the gas and power segment’s total revenue in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020,
slightlybelowthelevelof42.6%thesameperiodoftheprecedingfiscalyear.
sgre segment – total revenue of the sgre segment decreased from € 7,283 million in the nine-
month period ended june 30, 2019 by € 668 million, or 9.2% to € 6,615 million in the same
period of the fiscal year 2020. revenue development was considerably affected by the covid-19
pandemic (see “9.4.2.2 effects of the covid-19 pandemic and the oil price drop in early 2020”),
mainly in the onshore market. the overall decrease reflected a decline of revenue from both the
onshore and the offshore business, which was partly offset by growth of service revenue. while
the substantial decrease in revenue from the offshore business was in line with project execution
planning,thereductionofonshorerevenuewasduetodelaysintheexecutionofcertainprojects
in northern europe and thecontinuousslowdown in theindianmarket, bothexacerbatedbythe
covid-19 pandemic as well as due to trends in the prices of executed contracts, less volume of
143
installation work and the geographical mix of revenue with a substantially lower contribution
from the emea region. overall, on a geographical basis, the substantial decrease in the emea
region was only in part offset by substantial growth in the americas region and a moderate
increase in the asia, australia region. the sgre segment’s service revenue moderately increased
in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020 to € 1,226 million, up by € 59 million, or 5.1%,
from € 1,167 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2019. growth was driven by the
acquisition oftheservice assets from senvionin january2020(see “9.4.8.4 acquisition ofsenvion
group assets”) and by organic growth in maintenance revenue and spare part sales, offset by a
reduction in the sale of value-added solutions. this led to a service share of 18.5% of the sgre
segment’s total revenue in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, significantly above the
levelof16.0%thesameperiodofthefiscalyear2019.

in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, revenue in the emea region amounted to
€ 10,053 million, corresponding to a share of 50.7% of revenue of siemens energy. revenue in
this region was down from € 11,256 million in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2019 by
€ 1,203 million or 10.7%. a substantial decrease of revenue of the sgre segment due to the
reasons mentioned above, was slowed by a slight increase in revenue of the gas and power
segment,withgermanybalancinganegativedevelopmentinothercountriesoftheregion.
revenue in the americas amounted to € 6,247 million in the nine-month period ended june 30,
2020, corresponding to a share of 31.5% of revenue of siemens energy, up by € 318 million, or
5.4%, from € 5,929 million in the same period of the preceding fiscal year. the increase was
driven by substantially higher revenue in the sgre segment, as the u.s. were the main sourcefor
revenuefromtheonshorebusiness,whichmorethanoffsetamoderatedeclineofrevenueinthe

in the asia, australia region, revenues amounted to € 3,528 million in the nine-month period
ended june 30, 2020, corresponding to a share of 17.8% of revenue of siemens energy, up by
€ 210 million, or 6.3%, from € 3,318 million in the same period of the preceding fiscal year.
revenue moderately increased in the sgre segment and clearly in the gas and power segment,
including revenue driven by a technology collaboration in the field of heavy duty gas turbines in
china.
9.7.2.3 costofsales
cost of sales increased from € 17,420 million in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2019 by
€ 944 million, or 5.4%, to € 18,364 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020. the
moderate increase was due to noticeable impacts of the covid-19 pandemic (see “9.4.2.2 effects
ofthecovid-19pandemicandtheoil price dropin early 2020”), overall reflecting less fixed cost
absorption related to reduced capacity utilization caused by temporary disruptions in the supply
chainandplantclosures,aswellasprojectdelaysandclaimsfordamagesfromcustomers,aswell
144
as due to asset impairments and write-downs. the gas and power segment’s cost of sales did not
reflect the stable revenue pattern, but increased clearly compared to the prior year period, due
to inventory write-downs in the amount of € 225 million, in part associated with impairments of
intellectual property rights in relation to intangible assets acquired in business combinations in
the amount of € 318 million (see “9.7.2.13 adjusted ebita and adjusted ebita before special
items”), negative effects from project suspension and termination as well as a more unfavorable
product mix. moderately increased cost of sales in the sgre segment mainly resulted from
negative effects from project execution (especially in northern europe and india), which were
exacerbatedbycovid-19,combinedwithsharplyhigherintegrationcostsaswellasimpactsfrom
strategic portfolio decisions, mainly related to the resizing and restructuring plan for the indian
business and a plant closure in spain. amortization of intangible assets acquired in business
combinations included in cost of sales amounted to € 188 million and € 185 million in the nine-
monthperiodendedjune30,2020and2019,respectively.
9.7.2.4 grossprofit
gross profit sharply decreased from € 3,084 million in the nine-month period ended june 30,
2019 by € 1,621 million, or 52.6%, to € 1,463 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020,
reflecting decreased revenue and increased cost of sales at the same time during the nine-month
period ended june 30, 2020. the overall gross profit deterioration was primarily attributable to
the sgre segment posting a negative swing in gross profit. also, the gas and power segment
showed a substantially decreased gross profit due to, amongst others, cost of sales including
major non-recurring charges. the gross profit margin (calculated as the ratio of gross profit to
revenue) of siemens energy for the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020 of 7.4% decreased
sharply,comparedto15.0%inthesameperiodofthefiscalyear2019.

9.7.2.6 sellingandgeneraladministrativeexpenses
selling and general administrative expenses increased from € 1,945 million in the nine-month
period ended june 30, 2019 by € 378 million, or 19.4%, to € 2,323 million in the same period of
the fiscal year 2020. both segments showed a considerable increase in selling and general
administrative expenses, with the major part being caused by impairments of intellectual
property rights in relation to intangible assets acquired in business combinations in the amount
of € 170 million in the gas and power segment (“9.7.2.13 adjusted ebita and adjusted ebita
before special items”) as well as to the set-up of corporate functions in preparation for the
spin-off and listing of siemens energy. furthermore, included in selling expenses in the nine-
month period ended june 30, 2020 were royalties in an amount of € 40 million for the usage of
the combined designation “siemens energy” and the “siemens energy” trademark (see
“18.1.1.1.4 trademark and name use (sub-)license agreement with siemens energy”), such

period of fiscal year 2020. while the total of financial result and depreciation and amortization
was broadly stable compared to the same period of fiscal year 2019, the development of income
before income taxes was primarily determined by the patterns as discussed for adjusted ebita
(see“9.7.2.13adjustedebitaandadjustedebitabeforespecialitems”below).
9.7.2.11 incometax(expenses)/gains
in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, income tax gains of € 203 million were
recognized, compared to income tax expenses of € 67 million in the same period of the fiscal
year 2019. however, the effective tax rate of 12.1% (absolute value) for the nine-month period
ended june 30, 2020 was well below 24.8% for the same period in the fiscal year 2019, in
particularbecauseofthenon-recognitionofdeferredtaxassetsonlosscarryforwards.
9.7.2.12 netincome(loss)

9.7.2.13 adjustedebitaandadjustedebitabeforespecialitems
the development of adjusted ebita during the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020 was
impacted across all businesses by the covid-19 pandemic while the gas and power segment’s
industrial applications division in particular was also affected by the oil price development (see
“9.4.2.2 effects of the covid-19 pandemic and the oil price drop in early 2020”). adjusted ebita
of siemens energy fell from positive € 857 million in thenine-month periodendedjune30,2019
by € 2,068 million to a negative € 1,211 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020. the
sharp decline in adjusted ebita was due to the development in both segments. besides
considerable impacts due to covid-19 and the oil price development, gas and power recorded
impairments on intellectual property rights and in part associated with inventory write-downs
totaling € 713 million. furthermore the gas and power segment recorded a less favorable mix of
revenue and non-recurring carve-out-related expenses. adjusted ebita of the sgre segment
turned negative, mainly due to project delays, the slowdown in the indian market and covid-19
andsharplyhigherrestructuringandintegrationcosts.
special items within adjusted ebita of siemens energy in the nine-month period ended june 30,
2020 totaled € 1,124 million, compared to € 137 million in the same period of the fiscal year
2019, leading to an adjusted ebita before special items of siemens energy in the nine-month
period ended june 30, 2020 of negative € 87 million, compared to positive € 994 million in same
period a year earlier. the respective adjusted ebita margin before special items in the nine-
month period ended june 30, 2020 was negative 0.4%, compared to positive 4.8% in the same
periodofthefiscalyear2019.

gas and power segment – adjusted ebita of the gas and power segment decreased sharply from
positive € 506 million in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2019 by € 1,045 million to
negative € 539 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020. the decisive factors were
impairments on intellectual property rights in relation to intangible assets acquired in business
combinations in part combined with inventory write-downs of € 488 million and € 225 million,
respectively, both being associated with the divisions industrial applications and generation (see
also “9.4.10.3 special items”). the covid-19 pandemic noticeably impacted the gas and power
segment’s result due to project outages or shifts, underabsorption of fixed costs, shut downs of
productionandcustomer sites aswell asrelatedproject chargesandcost increasesmostlyrelated
to the divisions generation and transmission. a decrease of severance charges was more than
offset, as gas and power recognized additional expenses of € 19 million in connection with the
establishmentofsiemensenergyasanindependentcompany,whicharepartofthespecialitems
(see below). furthermore, related topics, e.g., royalties for the usage of the combined
designation “siemens energy” and the “siemens energy” trademark (see “18.1.1.1.4 trademark
and name use (sub-)license agreement with siemens energy”), which had no relevance in past
fiscal years, impacted adjusted ebita. adjusted ebita of the nine-month period ended june 30,
2019 was positively affected by a gain from the partial sale of an at-equity investment in the
amount of € 55 million, allocated to the transmission division. furthermore, the development of
the prior year period was influenced by a more favorable mix of revenues and positive effects
from the progress of projects. the adjusted ebita margin for the nine-month period ended

the same period of fiscal year 2019, including negative covid-19 effects (see “9.4.2.2 effects of
the covid-19 pandemic and the oil price drop in early 2020”) mainly concentrated on the
onshore business. the development of adjusted ebita reflects the execution of projects with
lower prices from the order backlog (onshore, offshore and service), which were offset by
improvements in productivity and fixed costs under the “l3ad2020” program (see
“9.4.10 integration and operational improvement measures; special items”). furthermore,
adjusted ebita was impacted by a less favorable business mix, with a lower contribution by the
emea region in the onshore business, and a lower contribution from the offshore business,
mainly due to lower revenue, which was in line with expectations. the service business delivered

faced project delays in northern europe and the slow-down of the indian market which was
further exacerbated by the effects of the covid-19 pandemic. this resulted in asset write-downs
and considerable cost increases, including charges related to two projects of € 183 million and
€ 95 million in northern europe and india, respectively. restructuring and integration costs
sharply increased to € 157 million accompanied by impacts of strategic portfolio decisions of
€ 195 million in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020 (see also “9.4.10.3 special items”),

defined measures resulted in inventory and fixed assets write-downs. in addition, due to the
deterioration of the indian market, the recoverability of the existing intangible assets has been
analyzed, and an impairment of intangible assets in the amount of € 82 million has been
recognized. the impacts mentioned were partially offset by the positive effect of the litigation

segments’ orders from service slightly decreased in the fiscal year 2019 by € 146 million, or1.2%
to € 11,630 million from € 11,776 million in the fiscal year 2018. this led to a share of 34.3% of

gas and power segment – orders of the gas and power segment increased from € 19,283 million
in the fiscal year 2018 by € 1,904 million, or 9.9%, to € 21,187 million in the fiscal year 2019.
while thedivisions transmission andindustrial applications contributed tothis development,the
generation division posted a moderate decrease. the overall increase on the reportable segment
level was driven by the new-unit businesses of all three divisions. volume from large orders
increased while service orders decreased in the fiscal year 2019 to € 8,893 million by
€ 430 million, or 4.6%, from € 9,323 million in the fiscal year 2018. this was mainly due to a
decrease in the generation division, which recorded higher volume from large service orders in
the emea region and the americas in the fiscal year 2018. this led to a service share of 42.0% of
thesegment’stotalorders,significantlybelowthelevelofthefiscalyear2018.
orders in the emea region decreased significantly, despite, among others, the gas and power
segment’s generationdivision successful bidfor alargecontract ofabout€0.4billionforaccpp
including service in france in the fiscal year 2019. moreover the transmission division was
awarded a hvdc order worth about € 0.4 billion in germany as well as an order of about
€ 0.3 billion for a large offshore grid connection project in the united kingdom, both being
postponed from the prior year. furthermore, the generation division secured an order of about
€ 0.3 billion for its solution business in brazil. the industrial applications division also recorded
large orders related to the product business and other power plants operated for external
customers in brazil and further smaller projects in canada and the united states, all supporting
thesubstantialgrowthintheamericas.

sgre segment – orders of the sgre segment increased from € 11,875 million in the fiscal year
2018 by € 874 million, or 7.4%, to € 12,749 million in the fiscal year 2019. effects from
acquisitions and disposals as well as foreign currency translation effects in total had nearly no
effect on order development. the order growth was driven by all businesses, in particular by a
151
higher volume from large orders. with service orders up by € 284 million, or 11.6%, service
orders amounted to € 2,737 million in the fiscal year 2019 after € 2,453 million in the fiscal year
2018. growth was driven by two offshore contracts signed in taiwan (as described below), both
of which included maintenance. this led to a share of 21.5% of the segment’s total orders,
moderatelyabove20.7%inthefiscalyear2018.
sharp order growth in asia, australia was supported by the recovery of the indian onshore
market since june 2019 and included two large orders for offshore wind power plants including
service in taiwan, totaling about € 2.3 billion. the sgre segment also recorded sharply higher
orders in the americas region, driven by several large orders in the onshore business mainly in
the united states, benefitting from the strength of the united states market in the fiscal year
2019. in contrast, orders came in substantially lower in the emea region, which in the fiscal year
2018 had included an order for an offshore wind power plant, including service, in the united
kingdomworthabout€1.3billion.
based on such order intake, sgre reached a book-to-bill ratio in the fiscal year 2019 of 1.2. the

revenue increased from € 28,023 million in the fiscal year 2018 by € 774 million, or 2.8%, to
€ 28,797 million in the fiscal year 2019. the increase was driven by significant revenue growth in
the sgre segment, with both new unit and service business significantly up. revenue of the gas
andpowersegmentslightly decreasedcomparedtothefiscalyear2018.primarily,revenueofthe
new-unit business of the generation division declined as a result of the weak order intake in
prior fiscal years. total segments’ revenue from service moderately increased in the fiscal year

in prior years in the generation and industrial applications divisions as well as a lower revenue
contribution from the projects in egypt. this project mainly impacted the generation division
(see “9.4.5.1 project business”), as related revenue in the fiscal year 2019 halved when compared
to the fiscal year 2018. a moderate increase in service revenue, also predominantly driven by the
generation division, could not offset the overall decline in the segment’s total revenue. on a
geographical basis, revenue decreased in the regions emea, due to lower contribution from the
projects in egypt, and asia, australia, partly offset by growth in the americas. the segment gas
and power’s service revenue moderately increased in the fiscal year 2019 by € 302 million, or
4.0%, to€7,931million from €7,629million in thefiscal year2018.thisledtoaserviceshareof

year 2018 by € 1,105 million, or 12.1% to € 10,227 million in the fiscal year 2019. the revenue
increase included significant growth in the offshore and service businesses and clear growth in
the onshore business. growth in the offshore business was in line with the activity that had been
planned for the fiscal year 2019, based on orders received in past periods. the increase in the
onshore business was mainly due to greater installation activity, with emea making a larger
contribution. on a geographical basis, revenue rose substantially in the emea region, while it
declined clearly in the americas and asia, australia. the sgre segment’s service revenue
significantly increased in the fiscal year 2019 to € 1,617 million by € 190 million, or 13.3%, from
€1,427millioninthefiscalyear2018.growthwasdrivenbyasignificantexpansioninthesaleof

share of 28.6% of revenue of siemens energy in the fiscal year 2019, up by € 426 million, or
5.5%, from € 7,796 million in the fiscal year 2018. the increase was driven by an increase in
revenue in the gas and power segment, which more than offset a clear decline of revenue in the
sgre segment. revenues in americas were mainly driven by a significant revenue increase in the
u.s.,whichcompensatedsubstantialdecreasesincanada.
increases in revenue in the emea region and the americas were partly offset by decreases of
revenue in the asia, australia region, which amounted to € 4,819 million in the fiscal year 2019,

in this region declined from € 5,346 million in the fiscal year 2018 by € 527 million, or 9.9%.
revenues in asia, australia decreased mainly due to a strong decline in thailand. with regard to
china and taiwan, the gas and power segment’s slight decline and the sgre segment’s
substantial decrease of revenue in china were more than compensated by the positive

9.7.3.3 costofsales
cost of sales increased from € 23,876 million in the fiscal year 2018 by € 739 million, or 3.1%, to
€ 24,615 million in the fiscal year 2019. in the fiscal year 2019, the sgre segment posted
significant higher cost of sales mainly due to project mix effects, negative impacts from project
execution (especially in northern europe and india) and a higher impact from restructuring and
integration costs as well as costs related to strategic portfolio decisions. this was partly offset by
a slight decrease in cost of sales in the gas and power segment compared to the fiscal year 2018.
positive effects from project execution and completion, less project-related quality issues as well
as substantially lower severance charges improved the generation division’s cost of sales. in
addition, in the fiscal year 2019, the generation division could realize sharply higher cost savings
from the“pg2020”program, whencomparedtotheprior fiscal year.theoverallpositiveeffects
from decreasing costs was limited by severance charges in connection with the “gp2020+”
program in the transmission division (see “9.4.10 integration and operational improvement
measures; special items”) as well as by reduced capacity utilization. cost of sales before

selling and general administrative expenses decreased from € 2,739 million in the fiscal year
2018 by € 92 million, or 3.4%, to € 2,647 million in the fiscal year 2019. in the fiscal year 2019,
selling and general administrative expenses were down in both segments compared to the fiscal
year 2018. while the extent of decline in the gas and power segment was in line with the
revenue development and in part due to lower severance charges, the sgre segment posted a
clear decrease in selling and general administrative expenses, mainly due to improvements in
productivity and fix costs under its “l3ad2020” program (see “9.4.10 integration and
operational improvement measures; special items”). selling expenses before € 152 million of
amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments in
the gas and power segment in the fiscal year 2019 amounted to € 1,657 million and accounted
for 83.1% of the segment’s selling and general administrative expenses before amortization of
intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments totaling
€ 1,993 million. selling and general administrative expenses before amortization of intangible
assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments amounted to € 2,402 million
(thereof € 1,993 million in the gas and power segment, € 405 million in the sgre segment and

operating income fell from € 231 million in the fiscal year 2018 by € 170 million, or 73.6%, to
€ 61 million in the fiscal year 2019, primarily as the fiscal year 2018 included gains totaling

industrial applications division (see “9.4.8.2 disposal of the single-stage and wastewater
compressorandsmallsteamturbinesbusiness”and“9.4.8.3disposalofpartsofthegovernment

of € 85 million in the fiscal year 2018 by € 196 million to an income of € 111 million in the fiscal
year 2019. this increase resulted primarily from an impairment in the amount of € 154 million in
the fiscal year 2018 relating to an at-equity investment in a provider of rotating equipment
services allocated to other operations in the gas and power segment, whereas the fiscal year
2019 included a € 55 million gain from a partial sale of an at-equity investment presented in the

to € 317 million in the fiscal year 2019. since the total of financial result and depreciation and
amortization remained at a stable level in the fiscal years 2018 and 2019, the development of
income before income taxes was primarily determined by the patterns as discussed for adjusted
ebita(see“9.7.3.13adjustedebitaandadjustedebitabeforespecialitems”below).

adjusted ebita of siemens energy increased from € 905 million in the fiscal year 2018 by
€ 159 million, or 17.6%, to € 1,064 million in the fiscal year 2019. the gas and power segment
157
reported an improved adjusted ebita despite declining sales. in total, negative impacts in the
fiscal year 2018 resulting from capacity adjustments in connection with personnel restructuring
were not recurring to the same extent in the fiscal year 2019. the adjusted ebita of the sgre
segment was largely at the prior year level, mainly as positive effects from productivity
improvements were offset by price declines, a less favorable project mix and higher impact from
restructuring and integration costs combined with costs related to strategic portfolio decisions.
reconciliation items remained largely stable in the fiscal year 2019 when compared with the
fiscal year 2018. the adjusted ebita margin of siemens energy group was 3.7% in thefiscal year
2019,after3.2%inthefiscalyear2018.
special items (see “9.4.10 integration and operational improvement measures; special items”) at
siemens energy in the fiscal year 2019 were € 453 million compared to € 551 million in the fiscal
year 2018, leading to adjusted ebita before special items in the fiscal year 2019 of
€ 1,517 million compared to € 1,456 million in the fiscal year 2018. the respective adjusted
ebita margin before special items in the fiscal year 2019 was 5.3%, nearly unchanged to the

gas and power segment – as adjusted ebita decreases in the industrial applications and the
transmission divisions were more than offset by an increase in the generation division, adjusted
ebita of the gas and power segment increased from € 440 million in the fiscal year 2018 by
€ 149 million, or 33.9%, to € 589 million in the fiscal year 2019. negative effects from lower
revenue and reduced capacity utilization were counterbalanced by a continuing strong
contribution from the service business as well as positive effects from project execution and
completion. further, adjusted ebita benefited from lower severance charges totaling
€ 247 million in the fiscal year 2019, mainly related to the transmission division and only to a
lesser extent to the generation division. in the fiscal year 2018, severance charges of
€ 375 million were related mainly to division generation under the “pg 2020” program (see also
“9.4.10 integration and operational improvement measures; special items”). in the fiscal year
2019, adjusted ebita benefited from the partial sale of an at-equity investment, which resulted
in a gain of € 55 million, allocated to the transmission division, almost compensated by a loss of
€ 54 million from the sale of a site for packaging and service of rotating equipment in hengelo,
netherlands, of the industrial applications division. in the fiscal year 2018, in contrast, the
industrial applications division benefited from gains totaling € 165 million from the disposal of
two businesses (see “9.4.8.2 disposal of the single-stage and wastewater compressor and small
steam turbines business” and “9.4.8.3 disposal of parts of the government business and u.s.
navyservicecenters”).
in total, thegasandpowersegment’s adjustedebitamarginincreasedto3.1%inthefiscal year

special items in thegasandpowersegmentin thefiscal year2019were €247million, compared
to € 375 million in the fiscal year 2018, leading to adjusted ebita before special items in the
fiscalyear2019of€836million,comparedto€815millioninthefiscalyear2018.therespective
adjusted ebita margin before special items in the fiscal year 2019 was 4.5%, moderately
increasedfrom4.3%inthefiscalyear2018.
sgre segment – adjusted ebita of the sgre segment remained nearly stable at € 481 million in
thefiscalyear2019,upby€3million,or0.6%,from€478millioninthefiscalyear2018.positive
effects from productivity improvements that were partially related to the “l3ad2020” program
(see “9.4.10 integration and operational improvement measures; special items”) and higher
revenue were offset by price declines, a less favorable project mix due to a higher volume of
lower margin onshore projects and in total higher impacts from restructuring and integration
costs of € 141 million together with costs related to strategic portfolio decisions of € 65 million
in the fiscal year 2019 compared to only restructuring and integration costs of € 176 million in
the fiscal year 2018. while severance charges, in particular related to capacity adjustments,
decreased to € 32 million in the fiscal year 2019 from € 86 million in the fiscal year 2018,
integration costs increased to € 109 million in the fiscal year 2019 from € 90 million in the fiscal
159
2018, primarily related to the acceleration of the product portfolio simplification. the adjusted

special items in the sgre segment in the fiscal year 2019 were € 206 million compared to
€ 176 million in the fiscal year 2018, leading to adjusted ebita before special items in the fiscal
year 2019 of € 687 million, compared to € 654 million in the fiscal year 2018. the respective
adjusted ebita margin before special items in the fiscal year 2019 was 6.7%, clearly decreased

gas and power segment – orders of the gas and power segment decreased clearly from
€ 21,029 million in the fiscal year 2017 by € 1,746 million, or 8.3%, to € 19,283 million in the
fiscal year 2018. this was mainly due to a substantially lower volume from large orders in the
solutions business of the transmission division, resulting from delays of tenders for large projects
bycustomers.thegasandpowersegment’sserviceordersmoderatelyincreasedinthefiscalyear
2018 to € 9,323 million by € 341 million, or 3.8%, from € 8,982 million in the fiscal year 2017,
driven by the generation division, which were related to the projects in egypt. this led to a
service orders share of 48.3% of the segment’s orders in the fiscal year 2018, significantly above
thelevelof42.7%thefiscalyear2017.
orders for the divisions generation and industrial applications developed positively, with the
major contribution from the generation division’s service business. large orders of both these
divisions were up in the emea region, while orders declined in the other two reporting regions,
the americas and asia, australia. in the fiscal year 2017, the generation division had contracted
several orders for ccpps in thailand, hong kong and pakistan. in contrast, the transmission
division showed a weak intake of large orders in the emea region, where in the fiscal year 2017
it recorded an order totaling about € 0.8 billion for an offshore grid connection project in
germany, an order totaling about € 0.6 billion for substations in qatar and further three hvdc

substantially fromthemergerinthefiscal year2017(see“9.4.8.1mergerofgamesaandsiemens
161
wind power into sgre and acquisition of iberdrola’s 8.1% shareholding in sgre”). the recovery
in the onshore market was the first lever driving growth in the sgre segment’s order intake,
benefitting from the reactivation of major wind markets such as brazil, spain, india and south
africa. in addition, the segment’s strong competitive position, which was reinforced by the
merger and the launch of the new product portfolio, played a significant role in order growth.
service orders increased in the fiscal year 2018 to € 2,453 million by € 381 million, or 18.4%,
from € 2,072 million in the fiscal year 2017. this led to a service orders share of 20.7% of the

9.7.4.2 revenue
revenue of siemens energy decreased from € 30,086 million in the fiscal year 2017 by
€ 2,063 million, or 6.9%, to € 28,023 million in the fiscal year 2018. the fiscal year 2017
represented an unusually high basis of comparison, as the fiscal year 2017 had included a major
share of revenue from the execution of the project in egypt (see “9.4.5.1 project business”). the
share of revenue of this project more than halved in the fiscal year 2018. as a result, the gas and
power segment posted a significant revenue decrease. this decrease was partly offset by
significant revenue growth year-over-year in the sgre segment, benefiting from the merger
leading to the formation of sgre s.a. in the fiscal year 2017. total segments’ revenue from
service in the fiscal year 2018 reached € 9,056 million and was with € 146 million, or 1.6%,

in the fiscal year 2017 by € 3,246 million, or 14.6%, to € 18,982 million in the fiscal year 2018. in
contracting gas and power markets caused by trends impacting the segment’s markets (see
“9.4.1.1 trends impacting the gas and power segment”), the overall decrease was driven by the
solutionsbusinessofthegenerationdivision.thegenerationdivisionand,toalimitedextentthe
transmission division, had recorded significant revenue from the execution of large orders
relatedtotheprojectsinegyptinthefiscalyear2017(see“9.4.5.1projectbusiness”),whichmore
than halved in the fiscal year 2018. the contribution of revenue from large orders decreased
generally driven by weaker order intake in prior years, particularly in the fiscal year 2017, as the
power generation market had declined significantly since the fiscal year 2016, leading to lower
orders and revenue in the following years. moreover, the transmission division’s business was
impacted by market cycles of turnkey substations. the gas and power segment’s revenue from
service slightly decreased in the fiscal year 2018 to € 7,629 million by € 147 million, or 1.9%,
from € 7,776 million in the fiscal year 2017, mainly attributable by the generation division’s
lower revenue contribution following lower order intake in the fiscal year 2017. this led to a
service revenue share of 40.2% of the segment’s total revenue, significantly above the level of
35.0%inthefiscalyear2017.
sgre segment – total revenue of the sgre segment increased from € 7,922 million in the fiscal
year2017by€1,200million,or15.1%,to€9,122millioninthefiscalyear2018.revenuegrowth
in the fiscal year 2018 benefited significantly from the merger in the fiscal year 2017 that led to
the formation of sgre s.a. (see “9.4.8.1 merger of gamesa and siemens wind power into sgre
and acquisition of iberdrola’s 8.1% shareholding in sgre”). the reported increase of total
revenueinthefiscal year2018wasdrivenbystronggrowthintheonshorebusiness,whichoffset
a price decline. in addition, strong project execution in the offshore business, as well as higher
revenue of value-added solutions from the service business, driven by growth of the fleet under
maintenance, supported the revenue increase. on a geographical basis, growth was mainly
163
coming from the region asia, australia, in particular from india where the market in the prior
year was impacted by the introduction of an auction system for wind power plant tenders (see
“9.4.1.2 trends impacting the sgre segment”). excluding effects from acquisitions and disposals,
revenue would have decreased clearly year-over-year, negatively affected by currency translation
effects, the project mix, a slower pace of onshore installations and a smaller offshore scope
compared to the fiscal year 2017. our sgre segment’s service revenue substantially increased in
the fiscal year 2018 to € 1,427 million by € 293 million, or 25.8%, from € 1,134 million in the
fiscal year 2017, including extraordinary effects from acquisitions and disposals. this led to a
service revenue share of 15.6% of the segment’s total revenue, clearly above the level of 14.3%
inthefiscalyear2017.

to a share of 53.1% of total revenue of siemens energy. revenue in this region was down from
€ 16,471 million in the fiscal year 2017 by € 1,590 million or 9.7%, as less revenue from the
projects in egypt could not be compensated by other projects. substantial growth in the sgre
segment, mainly due to the merger that led to the formation of sgre s.a. (see “9.4.8.1 merger
of gamesa and siemens wind power into sgre and acquisition of iberdrola’s 8.1% shareholding
in sgre”), was more than offset by a decrease of revenues in the gas and power segment in the
emearegion.
the americas contributed € 7,796 million, corresponding to a share of 27.8%, to revenue of
siemens energy in the fiscal year 2018, down by € 1,316 million, or 14.4%, from € 9,112 million
in the fiscal year 2017. revenue development in this region followed the segment pattern of the
emea region, as the decrease in the gas and power segment more than offset a substantial
increase in the sgre segment. the decline in the region was mainly related to significantly
reducedrevenueintheu.s.
decreases in revenue in the emea region and the americas were partly offset by increases of
revenue in the asia, australia region, which amounted to € 5,346 million in the fiscal year 2018,
corresponding to a share of 19.1% of revenue of siemens energy in the fiscal year 2018. while
revenue in china and taiwan was nearly level, compared to the prior fiscal year, total revenue in
asia, australia increased from € 4,503 million in the fiscal year 2017 by € 843 million, or 18.7%.
the revenue growth was primarily driven by the sgre segment, in particular from india where
the market in the prior year was impacted by the introduction of an auction system for wind
power plant tenders. revenue of the gas and power segment was down year-over-year in the
asia,australiaregion.

postedaclearcostreductionondecliningrevenue.however,thecostreductionwasheldbackby
factors predominantly effective in the generation division, including sharply higher severance
charges and reduced capacity utilization, as well as impacts from project-related quality issues
and negative effects related to project execution. the sgre segment recorded significant higher
cost of sales broadly in line with the revenue development in the fiscal year 2018. savings,
including synergies, from the transformation program within sgre’s “l3ad2020” strategy
program (see “9.4.10 integration and operational improvement measures; special items”) partly
offset integration and restructuring costs. cost of sales before amortization of intangible assets
acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments amounted to € 23,627 million

€ 311 million (therein gas and power segment: € 218 million; sgre segment € 93 million) in the
fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. special items within cost of sales amounted to
€ 399 million (thereof gas and power segment: € 290 million; sgre segment: € 109 million) and
€ 28 million (thereof gas and power segment: € 28 million) in the fiscal years 2018 and 2017,
respectively. cost of sales before amortization of intangible assets acquired in business

€ 7,036 million; reconciliation € (66) million) in the fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. this
resulted in cost of sales before amortization of intangible assets acquired in business
combinations and goodwill impairments and special items as a percentage of total revenue of
82.9%(81.2%inthegasandpowersegmentand86.6%inthesgresegment)and81.4%(78.8%

respectively.
9.7.4.4 grossprofit
gross profit fell from € 5,254 million in the fiscal year 2017 by € 1,107 million, or 21.1%, to
€ 4,147 million in the fiscal year 2018. this decrease was mainly driven by the gas and power
segment and its generation division with a substantial reduction of its gross profit on lower
revenue and price declines combined with a less favorable cost position and due to sharply
higher severance charges. the sgre segment posted a significantly improved gross profit on
increased revenue with a higher share from the service business, combined with an under-
proportional increase in cost of sales. the gross profit margin (calculated as the ratio of gross
profit to revenue) of siemens energy for the fiscal year 2018 of 14.8% decreased significantly,
comparedto17.5%inthefiscalyear2017.
9.7.4.5 researchanddevelopmentexpenses
research and development expenses decreased from € 1,111 million in the fiscal year 2017 by
€ 42 million, or 3.8%, to € 1,069 million in the fiscal year 2018. research and development

amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments
and special items as a percentage of total revenue of 3.6% (4.6% in the gas and power segment
and 1.6% in the sgre segment) and 3.7% (4.1% in the gas and power segment and 2.4% in the
sgresegment)inthefiscalyears2018and2017,respectively.
9.7.4.6 sellingandgeneraladministrativeexpenses
selling andgeneraladministrative expensesincreased from€2,631million inthefiscal year2017
by € 108 million, or 4.1%, to € 2,739 million in the fiscal year 2018. the increase was mainly
driven by additional expenses in relation to the gas and powers segment’s measures to improve
its competitiveness, as well as integration and restructuring measures in the sgre segment.
selling and general administrative expenses before expenses before amortization of intangible
assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments amounted to € 2,449 million
(thereof € 2,015 million in the gas and power segment, € 426 million in the sgre segment and
reconciliation of € 8 million) and € 2,436 million (thereof € 2,086 million in the gas and power
segment, € 343 million in the sgre segment and reconciliation of € 7 million) in the fiscal years
2018 and 2017, respectively. amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations
included in selling and general administrative expenses amounted to € 290 million (thereof gas
and power: € 154 million; sgre segment: € 136 million) and € 195 million (thereof gas and
power segment: € 47 million, sgre segment: € 148 million) in the fiscal years 2018 and 2017,
respectively. special items within selling and general administrative expenses amounted to
€ 96 million (thereof gas and power segment: € 53 million; sgre segment: € 43 million) and
€ 34 million (thereof gas and power segment: € 12 million; sgre segment: € 22 million) in the
fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. selling and general administrative expenses before
amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments
and special items amounted to €2,353million (thereof gasandpowersegment: €1,962million;
sgre segment: € 383 million; reconciliation € 8 million) and € 2,402 million (thereof
€ 2,074 million in the gas and power segment and € 321 million in the sgre segment;
reconciliation € 7 million) in the fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. this resulted in selling

business combinations and goodwill impairments and special items as a percentage of total
revenueof8.4%(10.3%inthegasandpowersegmentand4.2%inthesgresegment)and8.0%

9.7.4.8 income(loss)frominvestmentsaccountedforusingtheequitymethod,net
income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method, net decreased from an
income of € 65 million in the fiscal year 2017 by € 150 million to a loss of € 85 million in the
fiscal year 2018. this swing was mainly due to an impairment loss of € 154 million related to an
at-equity investment in a provider of rotating equipment services allocated to other operations
in the gas and power segment. the impairment based on the continuing adverse market
environment.
9.7.4.9 financialresult
negative financial result increased from € 181 million in the fiscal year 2017 by € 38 million, or
21.0%, to € 219 million in the fiscal year 2018. interest income slightly decreased from
€ 111 million in the fiscal year 2017 by € 2 million, or 1.8%, to € 109 million in the fiscal year
2018. interest expenses increased from € 298 million in the fiscal year 2017 by € 26 million, or
8.7%, to € 324 million in the fiscal year 2018. this increase was primarily related to higher
interest paid to banks and interest related expenses, mainly in the sgre segment and primarily
related to the merger that led to the formation of sgre s.a. other financial income (expenses),
net decreased from income of € 5 million in the fiscal year 2017 by € 9 million to expenses of
€4millioninthefiscalyear2018.
9.7.4.10 incomebeforeincometaxes
income before income taxes fell from € 1,309 million in the fiscal year2017by€1,158million to
€ 151 million in the fiscal year 2018. since the total of financial result and depreciation and
amortization remained broadly stable in the fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the development of
income before income taxes is determined by the patterns as discussed for adjusted ebita (see
“9.7.4.13adjustedebitaandadjustedebitabeforespecialitems”below).
9.7.4.11 incometax(expenses)/gains
in the fiscal year 2018, income tax gains of € 493 million were recognized while income tax
expenses in the fiscal year 2017 amounted to € 349 million. the change was attributable to the
development of current tax expenses, which decreased from € 536 million in the fiscal year 2017
by € 376 million to € 160 million in the fiscal year 2018, and deferred tax benefits, which
increased from € 188 million in the fiscal year 2017 by € 465 million to € 653 million in thefiscal
year 2018. the current tax expenses in the fiscal year 2018 were influenced from reassessment of
tax positions in different tax jurisdictions in the fiscal year 2018, which ledtoataxnetbenefitof
€ 325 million, compared to adjustments recognized for current taxes of prior years resulting in
income tax expenses of € 39 million in the fiscal year 2017. the deferred tax net benefits in the
fiscal year 2018 were primarily influenced by the revaluation of deferred taxes in an amount of
€ 264 million caused by the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (see “9.4.12 taxation”) and the
accompanyingreductionofthecorporateincometaxonthefederallevelfrom35%to21%.
9.7.4.12 netincome
as a result of the factors discussed above, net income fell from € 960 million in the fiscal year
2017by€315million,or32.8%,to€645millioninthefiscalyear2018.
9.7.4.13 adjustedebitaandadjustedebitabeforespecialitems
adjusted ebita of siemens energy sharply fell from € 2,028 million in the fiscal year 2017 by
€ 1,123 million to € 905 million in the fiscal year 2018. this drop was mainly attributable to the
gas and power segment’s decline in adjusted ebita, which primarily resulted from the decrease
of gross profit and sharply increased severance charges across all functional costs, as well as a
major impairment. this decrease was only partially offset by the increase of the sgre segment’s
167
adjusted ebita driven by higher revenues, a more favorable business mix and operational
improvementsduringthefiscalyear2018aswellaslowerassetwrite-downs.reconciliationitems
remained largely stable in the fiscal year 2018 when compared with the fiscal year 2017. the
adjusted ebita margin of siemens energy for the fiscal year 2018 of 3.2% decreased sharply,
comparedto6.7%inthefiscalyear2017.
special items (see “9.4.10 integration and operational improvement measures; special items”) of
siemens energy in the fiscal year 2018 were € 551 million compared to € 146 million in the fiscal
year 2017, leading to adjusted ebita before special items in the fiscal year 2018 of
€ 1,456 million, compared to € 2,174 million in the fiscal year 2017. the respective adjusted
ebita margin before special items in the fiscal year 2018 was 5.2% and substantially decreased
from7.2%inthefiscalyear2017.

gas and power segment – despite a continuing strong contribution from the services business,
adjusted ebita of the gas and power segment sharply fell from € 1,703 million in the fiscal year
2017by€1,263million, or74.2%,to€440millioninthefiscalyear2018.thiswasmainlydueto
the contribution of the generation division and to a lesser extent of the industrial applications
division, while the transmission division posted an improvement. the drop in the gas and power
segment’s adjusted ebita was primarily due to reduced capacity utilization, lower revenue, price
declines andnegativeeffects from project-related quality issues, cost increases aswell ascontract
penalties. furthermore, the segment’s adjusted ebita was impacted by the impairment of an
at-equity investment in a provider of rotating equipment services of € 154 million allocated to
other operations in the gas and power segment as well as restructuring costs related to
measures to improve the segment’s competitiveness. the segment’s burdens from severance
charges increased sharply from € 43 million in the fiscal year 2017 to € 375 million in the fiscal
year 2018, and were predominantly related to the generation division (see also
“9.4.10 integration and operational improvement measures; special items”). these negative
effects were partly offset bygainstotaling €165million fromthedisposaloftwobusinesses(see
“9.4.8.2 disposal of the single-stage and wastewater compressor and small steam turbines
business” and “9.4.8.3 disposal of parts of the government business and u.s. navy service
centers”) of the industrial applications division. the adjusted ebita margin of the gas and
power segment for the fiscal year 2018 of 2.3% decreased sharply from 7.7% in the fiscal year
2017.

adjustedebitamarginbeforespecialitemsofthegasandpowersegmentinthefiscalyear2018
was4.3%,sharplydecreasedfrom7.9%inthefiscalyear2017.
sgre segment – adjusted ebita of the sgre segment increased from € 330 million in the fiscal
year 2017 by € 148 million, or 44.8%, to € 478 million in the fiscal year 2018, was primarily
driven by the revenue increase, a higher services revenue, and operational improvements. these
factors were partially offset byprice declines,especiallyintheonshoremarkets.intheprioryear,
adjusted ebita was burdened by expenses totaling € 134 million primarily from inventory write-
downs. both years were impacted by significant restructuring and integration costs totaling
€ 176 million and € 103 million in the fiscal year 2018 and the fiscal year 2017, respectively, and
mainly related to post-merger integration after the formation of sgre s.a. (see “9.4.8.1 merger
of gamesa and siemens wind power into sgre and acquisition of iberdrola’s 8.1% shareholding
in sgre” and also “9.4.10 integration and operational improvement measures; special items”).
restructuring and integration costs in the fiscal years 2017 and 2018 were targeted at bringing
forward synergy delivery with a focus on reduction of employment positions and product
169
portfolio adaptions. the sgre segment’s adjusted ebita margin for the fiscal year 2018 of 5.2%
increasedsubstantiallyfrom4.2%inthefiscalyear2017.
special items of the sgre segment in the fiscal year 2018 were € 176 million, compared to
€ 103 million in the fiscal year 2017, leading to adjusted ebita before special items of the sgre
segment in the fiscal year 2018 of € 654 million, compared to € 433 million in the fiscal year
2017. the respective adjusted ebita margin before special items of the sgre segment in the
fiscalyear2018was7.2%,substantiallyincreasedfrom5.5%inthefiscalyear2017.

9.8.2 assets
9.8.2.1 comparisonasofjune30,2020andseptember30,2019
siemens energy applied ifrs 16 for the first time from october 1, 2019. first time application
affected the assets of siemens energy as set out under “9.5 key factors affecting comparability”
above. since siemens energy applied the “modified retrospective approach”, there is limited
comparabilityoftheassetsasofseptember30,2019andjune30,2020.
total assets increased from € 45,041 million as of september 30, 2019 by € 383 million, or 0.9%,
to € 45,424 million as of june 30, 2020. this development was mainly due to financing-related
topics and the first-time adoption of ifrs 16 as carve-out-related activities resulted in increased
financing-related balances with siemens group and the application of ifrs 16 led to the initial
recognition of right-of-use assets. these increases were partly offset by decreases due to changes
intheoperatingnetworkingcapitalandcertainindividualtopics.
totalcurrentassetsof€24,917millionasofseptember30,2019remainedbroadlyunchangedat
€ 24,491 million as of june 30, 2020. receivables from siemens group, mostly comprising
financing related balances, rose from € 3,402 million as of september 30, 2019 by € 492 million,
or 14.5%, to € 3,894 million as of june 30, 2020, mainly related to carve-out-related activities
during the first nine months of the fiscal year 2020 (see “9.9.6.1 financial liabilities”). cash and
cash equivalents, mostly comprising cash and cash equivalents from the sgre segment, increased
from € 1,871 million as of september 30, 2019 by € 481 million, or 25.7%, to € 2,352 million as
of june 30, 2020. these increases were largely offset by a decrease in components of operating
networkingcapital(foradiscussion,see“9.9.3operatingnetworkingcapital”below).
total non-current assets increased from € 20,124 million as of september 30, 2019 by
€ 809 million, or 4.0%, to € 20,933 million as of june 30, 2020. this change primarily resulted
171
from an increase in property, plant and equipment from € 3,275 million as of september 30,
2019by€1,515million,or46.3%,to€4,790millionasofjune30,2020,mainlyasaresultofthe
initial recognition of right-of-use assets with regard to the adoption of ifrs 16, the transfer of
real estate assets previously leased from siemens real estate to siemens energy and other
carve-out-related asset transfers, and to a minor extent related to the acquisition of the
european service business of senvion in the sgre segment (see “9.4.8.4 acquisition of senvion

€ 742 million as of september 30, 2019 by € 310 million, or 41.8%, to € 1,052 million as of june
30, 2020, due to carve-out-related tax benefits, e.g., the early termination and repayment of the
last outstandingloanofthedresser-randloans,andtaxlosscarryforwards. theseincreaseswere
partly offset by decreases in goodwill and other intangible assets from together € 14,558 million
as of september 30, 2019 by € 949 million, or 6.5%, to € 13,609 million as of june 30, 2020. the
decrease of goodwill was mainly due to currency translation differences, partly offset by
goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the european service business of senvion and
carve-out-related asset transfers. other intangible assets declined as a result of regular
amortizations and impairments of intellectual property rights in relation to intangible assets
acquired in business combinations in the gas and power segment in an amount of € 476 million,
less additions with regard to internally generated technology as well as customer relationships
and the order backlog related to the acquisition of the european service business of senvion,

total assets decreased from € 45,763 million as of september 30, 2018 by € 722 million, or 1.6%,
to € 45,041 million as of september 30, 2019. the main drivers for this development were
financing related topics and the change in operating net working capital. reduced financing
related balances with siemens group, and the sgresegmentoptimizing its cashposition ledtoa
decrease in total assets, while an overall increase of assets within operating net working capital
partlyoffsetthisreduction.
totalcurrentassetsdecreasedfrom€26,006million asofseptember30,2018by€1,089million,
or 4.2%, to € 24,917 million as of september 30, 2019. this decrease resulted, among others,
from a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, mostly comprising cash and cash equivalents from
the sgre segment, from € 2,544 million as of september 30, 2018 by € 673 million, or 26.5%, to

by €1,736million, or33.8%, to€3,402million asofseptember30,2019,partially relatedtothe
partial early termination and repayment of dresser-rand loans. these decreases were partially
offset by increases in components of operating net working capital (for a discussion, see
“9.9.3 operating net working capital” below). other current financial assets increased from
€ 454 million as of september 30, 2018 by € 276 million, or 60.8%, to € 730 million as of
september 30, 2019, mostly driven by changes in fair value of embedded and currency
derivatives. other current assets increased from € 833 million as of september 30, 2018 by
€ 260 million, or 31.2%, to € 1,093 million as of september 30, 2019, mainly driven by an

total non-current assets increased from € 19,757 million as of september 30, 2018 by
€ 367 million, or 1.9%, to € 20,124 million as of september 30, 2019. this change primarily
resulted from an increase in goodwill from € 9,462 million as of september 30, 2018 by
€ 353 million or 3.7%, to € 9,815 million as of september 30, 2019, mostly due to currency
translation differences. in addition, property, plant and equipment increased from €

other intangible assets from € 4,967 million as of september 30, 2018 by € 224 million, or 4.5%,
to € 4,743 million as of september 30, 2019, primarily due to regular amortizations of assets, the
effect of which were less pronounced when compared to the fiscal year 2018 due to

9.8.2.3 comparisonasofseptember30,2018andseptember30,2017
total assets decreased from € 47,290 million as of september 30, 2017 by € 1,527 million, or
3.2%, to € 45,763 million as of september 30, 2018. the decline in total assets was mainly due to
a reduced level of financing related balances with siemens group and the regular ongoing
business, including amortization of other intangible assets and the impairment of an at-equity
investment.
total current assets decreased from € 26,470 million as of september 30, 2017 by € 464 million,
or 1.8%, to € 26,006 million as of september 30, 2018. that mainly resulted from a decrease in
receivables from siemens group, mostly comprising financing related balances, which fell from
€ 6,324 million as of september 30, 2017 by € 1,186 million, or 18.8%, to € 5,138 million as of
september 30, 2018. this decrease was partially offset by increases in components of operating
net working capital (for a discussion, see “9.9.3 operating net working capital” below) and an
increase in cash and cash equivalents from € 1,850 million as of september 30, 2017 by
€ 694 million, or 37.5%, to €2,544million asofseptember30,2018,comprising mostly cashand
cash equivalents from the sgre segment, which was largely driven by sgre drawing from a new
multi-currency revolving credit facility as reflected in the increase in short-term debt and current
maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt (as described under “9.8.3.3 comparison as of
september30,2018andseptember30,2017”below).
total non-current assets decreased from € 20,821 million as of september 30, 2017 by
€ 1,064 million, or 5.1%, to € 19,757 million as of september 30, 2018. that was mainly due to a
decrease in other intangible assets, which decreased from € 5,449 million as of september 30,
2017 by € 482 million, or 8.8% to € 4,967 million september 30, 2018 due to regular
amortization charges and a decrease in investments accounted for using the equity method from
€ 933 million as of september 30, 2017, by € 149 million, or 16.0%, to € 784 million as of
september 30, 2018, mainly related to an impairment loss of € 154 million with regard to an
at-equity investment in a provider of rotating services allocated to other operations in the gas
andpowersegment.
9.8.3 liabilities
9.8.3.1 comparisonasofjune30,2020andseptember30,2019
siemens energy applied ifrs 16 for the first time from october 1, 2019. first time application
affected the liabilities of siemens energy as set out under “9.5 key factors affecting
comparability” above. since siemens energy applied the “modified retrospective approach”,

reasonsasforthedevelopmentoftotalassets,inparticularregardingcarve-out-relatedactivities
(see “9.9.6.1 financial liabilities”) and the first-time adoption of ifrs 16, which led to the initial
recognition of lease liabilities within short- and long-term debt. carve-out related activities lead
to a reduction in financing related balances with siemens group and a decline in pension
liabilities, partly offset by the effects of ifrs 16 and changes in the operating net working
capital.
total current liabilities decreased from € 23,487 million as of september 30, 2019 by
€ 1,055 million, or 4.5%, to € 22,432 million as of june 30, 2020. short-term debt and current
maturities of long-term debt increased from € 359 million as of september 30, 2019 by
€ 428 million, or 119.2%, to € 787 million as of june 30, 2020 primarily due to recognized lease
liabilities with regard to the adoption of ifrs 16 and an increase mainly in the sgre segment
173
which is related to increased cash and cash equivalents of the sgre segment (see
“9.8.2.1 comparison as of june 30, 2020 and september 30, 2019”). furthermore, increases in
componentsofoperatingnetworkingcapital(foradiscussion,see“9.9.3operatingnetworking

€ 1,981 million, or 66.9%, to € 979 million as of june 30, 2020, and reduced other current
liabilities, which decreased from € 3,267 million as of september 30, 2019 by € 263 million, or
8.1%, to € 3,004 million as of june 30, 2020, mainly due to declined liabilities to personnel and
salestaxliabilities.
total non-current liabilities decreased from € 8,465 million as of september 30, 2019 by
€ 1,724 million, or 20.4%, to € 6,741 million as of june 30, 2020. this was mainly due to a
decreaseinotherliabilities tosiemensgroup,mostlycomprisingfinancingrelatedbalances,from
€ 1,608 million as of september 30, 2019 to zero as of june 30, 2020. the decrease was due to
the early termination and repayment of the last outstanding loan of the dresser-rand loans (see
“9.9.6.1 financial liabilities”). provisions for pensions and similar obligations decreased from
€ 1,960 million as of september 30, 2019 by € 865 million, or 44.1%, to € 1,095 million as of
june 30, 2020 mainly due a funding of the pension obligations of german group companies by
approximately € 915 million (see “9.9.6.2 pensions and similar obligations”). in addition,
deferred tax liabilities decreased from € 1,102 million as of september30,2019by€516million,
or 46.8%, to € 586 million as of june 30, 2020, due to, amongst others, impairments of

€1,143million to€1,690million asofjune30,2020,primarily duetorecognizedleaseliabilities
with regard to the adoption of ifrs 16 and an increase mainly in the sgre segment, which is
related to increased cash and cash equivalents of the sgre segment (see “9.8.2.1 comparison as

8.9%, to € 31,952 million as of september 30, 2019. the change in total liabilities mirrored the
developmentoftotalassetsregardingfinancingrelatedtopicsandoperatingnetworkingcapital
mentioned above. this was reflected in a decrease in the sgre segment’s debt and reduced
financing related balances with siemens group, partly offset by increased liabilities within the
operatingnetworkingcapital.
total current liabilities slightly increased from € 23,418 million as of september 30, 2018 by
€ 69 million, or 0.3%, to € 23,487 million as of september 30, 2019. short-term debt and current

€ 1,000 million as of september 30, 2018 by € 641 million, or 64.1%, to € 359 million as of
september 30, 2019, as sgre reduced its use of its credit lines to optimize available cash, as
reflected in the reduction of cash and cash equivalents (as described under “9.8.2.2 comparison
as of september 30, 2019 and september 30, 2018” above). payables to siemens group, mostly
comprising financing related balances, decreased from € 3,958 million as of september 30, 2018
by € 998 million, or 25.2%, to € 2,960 million as of september 30, 2019. these decreases were

€ 4,576 million as of september 30, 2018, by € 2,968 million, or 64.9%, to € 1,608 million as of
september 30, 2019. this decrease was mainly driven by the partial early termination and
repayment of dresser-rand loans. long-term debt, which mainly relates to the sgre segment,
decreased from € 877 million as of september 30, 2018 by € 330 million, or 37.6%, to
174
€ 547 million as of september 30, 2019 as sgre reduced the use of its credit lines, as also
reflected in the reduction of cash and cash equivalents (as described under “9.8.2.2 comparison

€ 2,400 million as of september 30, 2018 by € 328 million, or 13.7%, to € 2,072 million as of
september 30, 2019, mostly driven by provisions for order-related losses and risks. these
decreases were partially offset by the increase in provisions for pensions and similar obligations,
which increased from € 1,622 million as of september 30, 2018 by € 338 million, or 20.8%, to
€ 1,960 million as of september 30, 2019 due to a lower discount rate partially offset by positive

2017 by € 709 million, or 37.2%, to € 1,195 million as of september 30, 2018, mainly driven by
the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities caused by the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (see also

combination rules described in note 1 to the unaudited condensed combined interim financial
statements. these effects resulted in a net increase of total equity of € 5,521 million and were
mainly related to transactions in the course of the formation of the group, in particular (i) the
funding of the pension obligations of the german group entities (see “9.9.6.2 pensions and
similar obligations”), (ii) carve-out-related asset transfers and (iii) transactions for the purpose

reflectedbytotalcomprehensiveincomeof€479millioninthefiscalyear2019,theincreasewas
mainly due to effects from applying the combination rules described in note 1 to the audited

requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and intercompany
financing from siemens group. until spin-off completion, it will continue to participate in
siemens group’s intercompany funding program, which includes certain intercompany loans and
deposits, cash management and cash pooling arrangements as well as indirect financing via local
banks backed by global letters of support issued by siemens. the cash management system
provides, among others, a siemens group-wide system for clearing and settlement of payables
and receivables between siemens energy group and siemens group. in addition, such cash
management system is, for example, used for the group’s payment and receipt of funds to and
fromexternalparties.
siemens energy’s payablestothesiemens groupfrom financingactivities slightly decreasedfrom
€ 8,519 million as of september 30, 2017 by € 25 million, or 0.3%, to € 8,494 million as of
september 30, 2018 and decreased by € 3,959 million to € 4,535 million as of september 30,
2019. the decrease as of september 30, 2019 compared to september 30, 2018 was mainly
attributable to the partial early termination and repayment of dresser-rand loans. the
remaining outstanding loan in an amount of € 1,571 million was terminated in february 2020
and has been repaid without impact on the combined statements of income. with this and
associated with certain capitalization measures during the nine-month period ended june 30,
2020 (see “9.9.6.1 financial liabilities”), payables to siemens group from financing activities to
thesiemensgroupfurtherdecreasedasofjune30,2020to€862million.
siemens energy also had short-term receivables from siemens group amounting to € 322 million
as of september 30, 2019 (september 30, 2018: € 2,220 million; september 30, 2017: € 2,678
million). the decrease in the fiscal year 2019 related mainly to the partial early termination and
repayment of dresser-rand loans. in february 2020, the last outstanding loan of the dresser-

9.9.1.1.2 financingstructurefollowingtothespin-off
in connectionwith thespin-off, theprevious intercompany financing programofsiemensgroup
will be replaced by a similar intercompany financing program operated by siemens energy that
willprovidecashmanagementandpoolingarrangements,clearingandsettlementofintra-group
and external payables and receivables, financing and liquidity investment opportunities to
participating siemens energy group companies (excluding sgre). in july 2020,seglobalgmbh&
co. kg and siemens energy finance b.v. as initial borrowers and a syndicate of international
banks as lenders have concluded a facility agreement including a € 3.0 billion revolving credit
facility to be used for general corporate purposes. the facility may be drawn in different
currencies, including euro, british pound or u.s. dollar. the facility agreement has an initial term
of three years, with two extension options for one year each, which are however at the
discretion of the lenders. siemens energy ag is required to accede to the facility agreement
shortly after spin-off completion. as of the date of this prospectus, no amounts have been
drawn under the facility agreement. for further information on the facility agreement, see
“12.9.1siemensenergyfacilityagreement”.
for an overview of siemens energy’s financial liabilities as of june 30, 2020, see “9.9.6.1 financial

9.9.1.2 financingstructureofthesgresegment
the sgre segment did not participate in siemens group’s intercompany funding program
mentioned above, especially with regard to cash pooling arrangements. the sgre segment is
financed at the level of sgre. the short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt as
well as long-term debt as presented in the combined statements of financial position as of
september 30, 2019 and september 30, 2018 mainly relate to a multi-currency revolving credit
facility and a loan signed as of may 30, 2018 by sgre, amounting both to a total of
€ 2,500 million, which replaced a € 750 million credit facility from 2017. the facility was
renegotiated in december 2019 with extended maturity dates and includes a term loan tranche
of € 500 million maturing in 2022 (previously maturing in 2021) and a revolving credit line
tranche of € 2,000 million maturing in 2024 (previously maturing in 2023) with two one-year
extension options. as of june 30, 2020, € 500 million (september 30, 2019: € 500 million;
september 30, 2018: € 700 million) have been drawn. the facility may be used for general
corporatepurposesandtorefinanceoutstandingdebt.
in january 2020, sgre signed two new loans amounting to € 240 million, both with maturity in
2023. additionally, in may 2020, two new bilateral short-term credit lines amounting to
€125millionweresigned,whichwillmaturein2021.
in march and may 2019, sgre signed new bilateral credit lines amounting to € 512 million, of
which € 412 million mature in 2020 and € 100 million are extendable by tacit agreement until
2022, accruing an average interest rate of 0.33%. during the nine-month period ended june 30,
2020, the € 412 million credit lines were extended until 2021. as of june 30, 2020, sgre has not

as of september 30, 2019, sgre has bilateral credit lines in india with annual maturities for an
amount of € 304 million. as of june 30, 2020, these credit lines amounted to € 414 million, of
which€386millionweredrawn.
as of september 30, 2019, sgre units had been granted loans and had drawn from credit
facilities that accounted for 23% of the total financing granted to them maturing between 2019
and 2029 (september 30, 2018: 46% granted; maturing between 2018 and 2026, september 30,
2017:48%granted;maturingbetween2017and2026).
as of september 30, 2017, sgre was using loan agreements amounting to € 424 million with
certain obligations as the compliance with financial ratios throughout the life of the agreement
relating to the capacity to generate resources in the operations, to the debt level and financial
duties. also, these arrangements established certain limits to the arrangement of additional
borrowings and to the distribution of dividends, as well as other conditions. not meeting these
177
contractual conditions would have enabled the banks to demand early repayment. as of
september 30, 2017, the established financial ratios were met. as of september 30, 2019 and

since cashflowsfromfinancingactivities ofthegasandpowersegmentweremainlydetermined
by inter-company financing from siemens group, we believe that cash flows from financing
activities shown in the table above and discussed below are not indicative for siemens energy’s
futurecashflowsfromfinancingactivitiesfromastand-aloneperspective.
9.9.2.1 comparisonofcashflowsinthenine-monthperiodsendedjune30,2020and2019
9.9.2.1.1 cashflowsfromoperatingactivities
cash flows from operating activities of negative € 585 million in the nine-month period ended
june 30, 2019 swung to positive cash flows from operating activities of € 561 million in the same
period of the fiscal year 2020. this was mainly duetoapositive changein operatingnetworking
capitalanddespitethenegativeprofitdevelopment.theimprovementofoperatingnetworking
capital was across all its components and particularly due to the development of inventories and
contract liabilities. in total, the change in operating net working capital resulted in net cash
inflows in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020 of € 879 million compared to net cash
outflowsof€875millioninthesameperiodoffiscalyear2019.furthermore,cashoutflowsfrom
the change in other assets and liabilities improved sharply to € 296 million in the nine-month
periodendedjune30,2020from€953million inthesameperiodofthefiscalyear2019,related
to miscellaneous topics, amongst others, due to the change in provisions for order related losses
and risks as well as in value added and sales tax receivables. this was partially offset from cash
outflows from income taxes paid of € 254 million, sharply increased compared to outflows of
€147million in thenine-month periodendedjune30,2019sincethelowercashoutflowsofthe
prior year period were primarily attributable to a refund of income taxes from the tax group
withsiemensindustrialintheu.s.
9.9.2.1.2 cashflowsfrominvestingactivities
cash flows from investing activities substantially decreased to cash outflows of € 653 million in
the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, compared to cash outflows of € 503 million in the
sameperiodoffiscal year2019.this decreaseresulted mainly from acquisitions ofbusinesses,net
of cash acquired, as sgre acquired selected european assets of senvion group during the nine-
month period endedjune30,2020(see “9.4.8.4 acquisition ofsenviongroupassets”), which led
tocashoutflowsof€177million.furthermore,additionstointangibleassetsandproperty,plant
and equipment moderately increased from € 515 million in the nine-month period ended
june30,2019by€28millionto€543millioninthesameperiodofthefiscalyear2020.thiswas
partly offset by cash inflows from disposal of businesses, net of cash disposed, which swung from
cash outflows of € 58 million in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2019 to cash inflows of

9.9.2.1.3 cashflowsfromfinancingactivities
cashflowsfromfinancingactivities amountedtocashinflowsof€674millioninthenine-month
period ended june 30, 2020, which corresponded to an increase of € 1,069 million from cash
outflows from financing activities of € 395 million in the same period of fiscal year 2019. cash
flow improved due to the change in debt and other financing activities, mostly related to
financingactivitiesofthesgresegment.
9.9.2.1.4 freecashflow
free cash flow (the balance of cash flows from operating activities and additions to intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment) in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020
improved sharply by € 1,117 million to positive € 18 million from negative € 1,099 million in the
same period of the fiscal year 2019. this change is primarily a result of the positive swing from
cash outflows from operating activities in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2019 to cash
inflows in the same period of the fiscal year 2020 (as described above). from a reportable
segment point of view, this was due to a sharp improvement in both reportable segments, each
posting a positive swing with cash inflows in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, after
cash outflows in the same period of fiscal year2019,mainly duetocashinflows from areduction
ofoperatingnetworkingcapital.

9.9.2.2.1 cashflowsfromoperatingactivities
cashflowsfromoperatingactivitiesincreasedfromcashinflowsof€844millioninthefiscalyear
2018 by € 850 million to cash inflows of € 1,694 million in the fiscal year 2019. this increase was
mainlyattributabletothechangeinoperatingnetworkingcapitalwhichresultedincashinflows
in the fiscal year 2019 totaling € 938 million compared to cash outflows of € 245 million in the
fiscal year 2018, and lower cash outflows from income taxes paid (primarily attributable to a
refund of income taxes in the fiscal year 2019 from the tax group with siemens industrial in the
u.s.). within operating net working capital, the improvements primarily resulted from asset
management initiatives of the gas and power segment. in total, € 1,174 million of the higher
cash inflows year-over-year are attributable to the changes in contract assets and contract
liabilities, which were in part offset by increased cash outflows from change in other assets and
liabilities due to cash outflows related to restructuring measures. cash inflows from change in
other components of operating net working capital in total remained nearly unchanged when
compared with the fiscal year 2018, as higher cash outflows from inventories in the fiscal year
2019 were offset by increased cash inflows from trade and other receivables as well as trade
payables.
9.9.2.2.2 cashflowsfrominvestingactivities
cash flows from investing activities amounted to cash outflows of € 797 million in the fiscal year
2019, which corresponded to an increase in cash outflows of € 368 million, or 85.8%, from cash
outflows of € 429 million in the fiscal year 2018. this increase in cash outflows from investing
activities resulted mainly from changes in cash flows from the disposal of businesses, net of cash
disposed, which fell from a net cash inflow of € 350 million in the fiscal year 2018 by
€ 400 million to a net cash outflow of € 50 million in the fiscal year 2019. in the fiscal year 2018,
cash flows from the disposal of businesses, net of cash disposed were unusually high, as siemens
energy sold its single-stage and wastewater compressor business and its small steam turbine
business, both including service, for € 193 million, increasing cash and cash equivalents,
respectively (see “9.4.8.2 disposal of the single-stage and wastewater compressor and small
steam turbines business”), and parts of its government business and u.s. navy service centers for
€ 174 million in cash and cash equivalents (see “9.4.8.3 disposal of parts of the government
business and u.s. navy service centers”). both of these disposals contributed to cash flows from
thedisposalofbusinesses,netofcashdisposedinthefiscalyear2018.

9.9.2.2.3 cashflowsfromfinancingactivities
cash flows from financing activities amounted to cash outflows of € 1,597 million in the fiscal
year 2019 compared to cash inflows from financing activities of € 330 million in the fiscal year
2018. this decrease resulted mainly from a decrease in change in debt and other financing
activities, which turned from cash inflows of € 527 million in the fiscal year 2018 by
€ 1,492 million to cash outflows of € 965 million. the change in cash flows related to the sgre
segment’s reduced use of its credit lines to optimize available cash. other transactions/financing
with siemens group changed from cash inflows of € 44 million in the fiscal year 2018 to cash
outflowsof€367millioninthefiscalyear2019.
9.9.2.2.4 freecashflow
free cash flow (the balance of cash flows from operating activities and additions to intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment) increased from € 80 million in the fiscal year 2018 by
€ 796 million to € 876 million in the fiscal year 2019. this change is primarily a result of the
increase of cash flows from operating activities (as described above). on the reportable segment
level, this increase was mainly driven by an increase of free cash flow of the gas and power
segment, which increased from € 212 million in the fiscal year 2018 to € 651 million in the fiscal
year 2019, and a decrease in cash outflows in reconciliation to combined financial statements,
which decreased from cash outflows of € 504 million in the fiscal year 2018 to cash outflows of
€182millioninthefiscalyear2019.theincreasedfreecashflowofthegasandpowersegment
mainly resulted from improvements of cash inflows of operating net working capital, while the
decrease in cash outflows in reconciliation to combined financial statements mainly related to
tax-induced cash outflows, which had a smaller effect in the fiscal year 2019 than in the fiscal
year2018.thisfreecashflowdevelopmentledtoacashconversionrateof0.8inthefiscalyear
2019,comparedto0.1inthefiscalyear2018.
9.9.2.3 comparisonofcashflowsinthefiscalyears2018and2017
9.9.2.3.1 cashflowsfromoperatingactivities
cash flows from operating activities increased from € 686 million in the fiscal year 2017 by
€ 158 million, or 23.0%, to € 844 million in the fiscal year 2018. this increase was mainly due to
changes in operating net working capital which resulted in reduced cash outflows in the fiscal
year 2018 totaling € 245 million compared to cash outflows of € 1,445 million in the fiscal year
2017. both reportable segments contributed to the improvement with different focuses andwith
the higher contribution of the sgre segment. while the gas and power segment reduced cash
outflows year-over-year primarily from contract assets and liabilities, the sgre segment reduced
its cash outflows particularly by a positive cash flow swing from inventories. on that basis, the
negative effects from the decreasing profit development (including the negative impact of
non-cashincometaxexpenses)weremorethanoffset.
9.9.2.3.2 cashflowsfrominvestingactivities
cash flows from investing activities amounted to cash outflows of € 429 million in the fiscal year
2018, which corresponded to a decrease in cash outflows of € 406 million, or 48.6%, from cash
outflows of € 835 million in the fiscal year 2017. this change was mainly driven by the sale of
siemens energy’s single-stage and wastewater compressor business and its small steam turbine
business, both including service, resulting in cash inflows of € 193 million, and parts of its
government business and u.s. navy service centers resulting in cash inflows of € 174 million (see
“9.4.8.2 disposal of the single-stage and wastewater compressor and small steam turbines
business” and “9.4.8.3 disposal of parts of the government business and u.s. navy service
centers”),whichcontributedtocashinflowsfromthedisposalofbusinesses,netofcashdisposed

9.9.2.3.3 cashflowsfromfinancingactivities
cash flows from financing activities fell from € 1,890 million in the fiscal year 2017 by
€ 1,560 million, or 82.5%, to € 330 million in the fiscal year 2018. this decrease resulted mainly
from other transactions/financing with siemens group, which fell from cash inflows of
€ 1,868 million in the fiscal year 2017 to cash inflows of € 44 million in the fiscal year 2018, due
the change of financing-related balances, primarily related to the partial early termination and
repaymentofdresser-randloans.thisdecreasewaspartiallyoffsetbychangeincashflowsfrom
debt and other financing activities, which increased from € 292 million in the fiscal year 2017 by
€235million,or80.5%,to€527millioninthefiscalyear2018.
9.9.2.3.4 freecashflow
free cash flow (the balance of cash flows from operating activities and additions to intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment) increased from cash outflows of € 121 million in the
fiscal year 2017 to cash inflows of € 80 million in the fiscal year 2018. overall, this change is
mainly due to the increase of cash flows from operating activities (as described above). from a
reportable segment perspective, free cash flow of the gas and power segment fell from
€ 722 million in the fiscal year 2017 to € 212 million in the fiscal year 2018, primarily related to
the decreasing profit development, free cash flow of the sgre segment increased from cash
outflows of €288million in thefiscal year2017tocashinflows of€373million in thefiscal year
2018. the positive swing at sgre was mainly due to cash inflows from change in operating net
working capital, particularly inventories, as well as strict control of capital expenditures. cash
outflows from reconciliation to combined financial statements remained largely stable. this
free cash flow development led to a cash conversion rate of 0.1 in the fiscal year 2018,
comparedto(0.1)inthefiscalyear2017.

9.9.3.1 comparisonasofjune30,2020andasofseptember30,2019,2018and2017
operating net working capital substantially decreased from € 3,864 million as of september 30,
2019 by € 1,280 million, or 33.1%, to € 2,584 million as of june 30, 2020. the development was
mainly due to higher advance payments from customers (reflected in significantly increased
contract liabilities) and a clear reduction of contract assets. a slight inventory build-up and
increase of trade receivables as well as slightly declined trade payables offset the improvements
onlytoaminorextent.bothsegmentscontributedtothisdevelopment.
operating net working capital decreased from € 4,643 million in the fiscal year 2018 by
€ 779 million, or 16.8%, to € 3,864 million in the fiscal year 2019. the development reflects the
success of asset management measures, initiated during the fiscal year 2019. the gas and power
segment’s cash initiative started early in the fiscal year 2019. the measures taken led to an
improvement of its operating net working capital, mainly by a reduction of overdue accounts
receivable. also, the sgre segment strengthened its working capital management with a strong
control program with focus on advance payments, payment terms renegotiation and project
execution, leading to an improvement of its operating net working capital, mainly driven by
contractassetandliabilitiesandparticularlyrelatedtoprojectprogressandadvancepayments.
operating net working capital increased from € 4,511 million in the fiscal year 2017 by
€132million, or2.9%,to€4,643million inthefiscal year2018.reductionsinthesgresegment
were driven by a substantial reduction of inventory levels as a result of asset management
measurestaken,mainlyduetoprojectprogressandsaleoffinishedgoods.thisimprovementwas
more than offset by an increase of operating net working capital in the gas and power segment
in the fiscal year 2018, which was driven by higher receivables mainly due to shifted or delayed
184
milestone payments and a reduction in contract liabilities (mainly due to volume decrease,
unfavorablepaymentconditionsandexecutionofpre-financedprojects).
9.9.3.2 ongoingprogramstoimproveoperatingnetworkingcapitalmanagement
to improve its operating net working capital position, siemens energy has ongoing asset
management measures in place, especially in (but not limited to) the gas and power segment.
siemens energy’s asset management initiative commenced in the second half of the fiscal year
2019 and was gradually transferred into the full responsibility of the operative business units in
may 2020. furthermore, additional measures are planned for the fiscal year 2021. in this context,
determined operating net working capital targets focus on the reduction of hardware inventory
with low turns and demands in both new unit plants and service warehouses (e.g., improvement
of forecasting process with external vendors and internal users, development of “exchangium”
platform for offering surplus material to potentially internal/external users). in addition, special
emphasisisgivenonthestringentreductionofaccountsreceivablesoverdue,whilstmeasuresare
initiated to better payment terms in the marketing and selling process (higher advance
payments, strive for cash positive throughout entire contract term) as well as in the procurement
process (avoidance of discounts, more favorable payment terms). measures taken are
systematically monitored by newly developed automated tools and harmonized cockpits that
have been adopted to enable maximum transparency and comparability on the development of
operating net working capital. operating net working capital numbers are regularly reported to
and discussed with the management. mandatory cash awareness webinars and cash rewarding
projectsarecontemplatedtobeavailableinearlyfiscalyear2021.
until the end of the fiscal year 2023 at the latest, in particular for our gas and power segment,
we aim for a reduction of its operating net working capital of approximately € 1.2 billion,
compared to september 30, 2019. therefore, we strive for trade receivables, inventories and
trade payables of the gas and power segment reaching no more than 19%, 22% and at least
11%,respectively,ofitsrevenue,attheendofthefiscalyear2023.
9.9.4 netcapitalemployed
net capital employed is siemens energy’s measure to assess capital intensity of the segments. its
definition corresponds to the adjusted ebita measure except for amortization expenses of
intangibleassetsacquiredinbusinesscombinationsandgoodwillimpairments whicharenotpart
of adjusted ebita, however, the related intangible assets are included in the segments’ assets.
segment net capital employed is based on total assets of the combined statements of financial
position, primarily excluding financing receivables from siemens group, tax related assets and
assets of discontinued operations, since the corresponding positions are excluded from adjusted
ebita. the remaining assets are reduced by non-interest-bearing liabilities other than tax related
liabilities, e.g., trade payables and contract liabilities, to derive net capital employed. net capital
employed of siemens gamesa renewable energy includes real estate, while real estate of gas

the table below shows a detailed view of the net capital employed of the gas and power
segment and the sgre segment as of june 30, 2020. the figures in the table below are based on
the above mentioned definition of the segment’s assets as determined by the management.
therefore, by definition, such figures are not to be reconciled for each line item to figures
presented in the unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements, but rather are
reconciled to total assets of siemens energy as reported in note 8 to the unaudited condensed
combinedinterimfinancialstatements.

additions to other intangible assets primarily relate to capitalized research and development
expenses.
capital expenditures of the gas and power segment, presented as additions to intangible assets
and property, plant & equipment in the audited combined financial statements, amounted to
€ 317 million in the fiscal year 2019, € 343 million in the fiscal year 2018, € 315 million in the
fiscal year 2017, and € 181 million in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020. the
investments of gas and power were focused on development of new or improvement of existing
products, enhancing productivity through automation, expansion and replacement of capacities
and increasing customer proximity via strategic localization of capacity (see “9.4.6 technological
innovation”). the largest investment projects were the development of a next generation
product portfolio for future h- and j-class ccpps and packages, which resulted, among others, in
the development of the new sgt-9000hl turbine model that was brought to market in the fiscal
year 2018 (see “9.4.6 technological innovation”), and capital expenditures for manufacturing
andengineeringofthecastingofturbinebladesandvanesviaajointventure.
capital expenditures of the sgre segment, presented as additions to intangible assets and
property, plant & equipment in the audited combined financial statements, amounted to
€498million inthefiscal year2019,€415million inthefiscalyear2018and€476millioninthe
fiscal year 2017, and € 352 million in the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020. the
investments of sgre were focused on production equipment for new blade types and capacity
188
expansion in its factories. other investments were related to development of new wind turbine
platforms, logistic and construction tools in the onshore business, and special equipment for
testing and installation of newly launched products in the offshore business (see
“9.4.6 technological innovation”). major investment projects are the onshore blades factory
tangier, morocco, and the offshore nacelles factory in cuxhaven, germany. the increase of
additions to other intangible assets since the fiscal year 2017 related to internally generated
technology as the sgre segment reported a continued increase in the capitalized development
costs duetothedevelopmentofnewwind turbinemodels, software andtheoptimizationofthe
components’performance.
9.9.5.2 ongoingandplannedcapitalexpenditures
for the fiscal year 2020, we have budgeted capital expenditures in an amount of over
€ 900 million and expect capital expenditures for intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 3%, and in our fiscal year 2020 to be
higher than in the fiscal year 2019. our capital expenditures were and still are impacted by
covid-19,whichwillresult,toacertainextent,inshiftstothefiscalyear2021.

both segments invest in regular maintenance, optimizations and capacity enhancements. our
sgre segment is committed to capital expenditures that correspond to a mid-single-digit
percentage of its revenues. currently, we do not plan any major acquisitions, although we will
continuetoevaluatebolt-onacquisitions.

9.9.6 financialliabilitiesandotherfinancialcommitments
9.9.6.1 financialliabilities
in the periods presented, the gas and power segment was included in siemens group’s
intercompany financing, including cash pooling and cash management and will continue to be
included in such program until spin-off completion. in addition, siemens group provided short-
and long-term loans (see “9.9.1.1.1 financing structure prior to the spin-off”), while siemens
energy’s financing from third-party sources mainly relates to the financing of our sgre segment
(assetoutinthetablebelow).
siemens energy’s (net cash) / net debt represents total debt (short-term debt and current
maturities of long-term debt plus long-term debt plus payables to siemens group from financing
activities) minus total liquidity (cash and cash equivalents plus receivables from siemens group
from financing activities). since, until spin-off completion, (net cash) / net debt of the gas and
power segment was mainly composed of liabilities to and receivables from the siemens group,
we believe the historical balances shown in the table below as of september 30, 2019, 2018 and
2017 are of limited information for siemens energy’s financing structure from a stand-alone
perspective. during the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020, certain transactions concerning
(net cash) / net debt and adjusted (net cash) / net debt, respectively, have occurred in
connection with the formation as well as future funding of the siemens energy group. these
transactions were intended to settle financing balances of entities allocated to the gas and
power segment with siemens group and to provide the gas and power segment with an
adequate net cash position. we therefore believe figures as of june 30, 2020 are of higher
information value with regard to our future financing structure. among the transactions were
thefollowing:
(cid:129) in january 2020, a contractual trust arrangement (“cta”) that acts as the pension trust for
german group companies to finance their pension obligations was funded with assets of
approximately € 0.9 billion by way of contribution from siemens (see also below
“9.9.6.2pensionsandsimilarobligations”).
(cid:129) in february 2020, the last outstanding loan of the dresser-rand loans was terminated early
and fully repaid in a nominal equivalent amount of € 1,571 million which resulted in other
liabilitiestosiemensgroup(long-term)ofzeroasofjune30,2020.
(cid:129) until june 30, 2020, siemens provided to siemens energy for the purpose of achieving the
envisaged capital structure of siemens energy group via clearing accounts approximately
€ 3.4 billion (thereof € 3.2 billion in the second quarter of the fiscal year 2020 and another
€ 0.1 billion in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2020). this capitalization is in addition to
approximately € 3.0 billion provided by siemens with regard to purchase price obligations for
the legal transfer of assets to siemens energy which are already included in the combined
financial statements (see “5.2.2 rest of world carve-out”). the capitalization comprises a sum
in the amount of € 0.4 billion which is planned for the implementation of a share buy-back
program of siemens energy ag in the near future (a period of presumably six months is
envisaged for the share buy-back) related to a stock-based compensation program. the
capitalization of € 3.4 billion was on a gross basis, hence, before the repayment of various
remaining (short-term) financing arrangements with siemens existing asofmarch 31,2020.on
balance, the capitalization resulted in sizeable net cash of € 2.2 billion as of june 30, 2020 of
siemens energy (excluding sgre business activities), which we believe forms the basis for a
strongfinancingstructureofsiemensenergy.
(cid:129) in addition, siemens provided funds of € 0.2 billion during the second quarter of fiscal year
2020 to fund deferred carve-out activities for which the related assets to be acquired are not
includedinourcombinedfinancialstatements.
(cid:129) after spin-off completion, then still existing balanceswith siemens from theongoingbusiness
after march 31, 2020 will be offset and settled against cash and cash equivalents, except
receivables from siemens group of approximately € 0.9 billion as of june 30, 2020, relating to
190
certain trade contracts which remain at siemens and then will be reclassified to trade and
otherreceivables.

with its future financing structure (under a stand-alone perspective), siemens energygroupaims
for a balanced capital structure based on the capitalization described above which allows for a
solid investment grade rating, so as to ensure sufficient flexibility for ready access to bank and
capital markets, to sustain the ability to repay and service its debt obligations over time, and to
be a reliable long-term partner to its customers. the main performance measure used to assess
ourcapitalstructureistheadjusted(netcash)/netdebttoebitdaratio.theratioindicatesthe
approximate number of years that would be needed to cover the adjusted (net cash) / net debt
through income from continuing operations, without taking into account interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization. we strive to maintain our solid investment grade rating and do
not steer our capital structure according to a specific target ratio. as a general guidance, an
adjusted (net cash) / net debt to ebitda ratio below 1.5 may be considered to be consistent
with the aim of a solid investment grade rating. our sgre segment has committed to capital

almostalldomesticemployeesandthemajorityoftheforeignemployees.
9.9.6.2.1 definedbenefitplans
in most countries, our employees historically participated in the siemens group pension plans.
for these plans, pension benefits are administered by the siemens group. as a result of the
carve-out, pension assets and obligations relating to the group’s current and former employees
have been transferred to separate group pension plans and, in most countries, separate pension
trusts or will be transferred in the near future. in germany, pension obligations towards passive
employees of the energy business have not been transferred and will be retained by the siemens
group.
as of september 30, 2019, we had defined benefit obligations (“dbo”) of € 3,310 million, of
which 44.0% related to germany, 29.4% to the united states and 10.1% to the united kingdom,
whiletheremaining16.6%relatedtocertainothercountries.
as the majority of the siemens energy pension liabilities derives from three major countries,
furtherinformationonthepensionlandscapeinthesethreecountriesisgivenbelow:
(cid:129) germany – in germany, the siemens group provides pension benefits through the following
plans: bsav (beitragsorientierte siemens altersversorgung, “bsav”), closed legacy plans and
deferred compensation. siemens energy has set up a cta which acts as pension trust (gp trust
e.v.). siemens energy acts as sole trustor for the bsav and the closed legacy plans, while for
the deferred compensation plan the participating group entities are acting as trustors. this
cta has been funded with assets that had a fair value of approximately € 915 million as at
january2,2020.duetomarketvolatilitythefairvalueoftheseassetsissubjecttochange.
(cid:129) united states – in the united states, siemens energy currently participates in the defined
benefit plans sponsored by siemens group, which for the most part have been frozen to new
entrants and to future benefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts.
prior to the setup of separate pension plans, the group participated, amongst others, in the
siemens pension plan as the main pension plan for the siemens group. a separate pension
trust for ouru.s. entities (the “siemens energyu.s.trust”)towhichourpensionliabilities and
related assets will be transferred from the siemens trust in the u.s. (the “siemens u.s. trust”)
is expected to be set up in september 2020. the allocation of the u.s. pension assets currently
held by the siemens u.s. trust for the siemens pension plan to be transferred to the siemens
energy u.s. trust will be calculated in accordance with internal revenue code section 414(l).
the calculation can result in a different amount of assets compared to the current asset
allocation in the audited combined financial statements. the result of the 414(l) calculation is
the final amount of assets which will be physically transferred to the siemens energy u.s. trust
afterithasbeensetup.
(cid:129) unitedkingdom–in theunitedkingdom,pensionbenefitsaremainlyofferedthroughtheva
tech u.k. pension scheme which transfers to siemens energy completely. from april 2013 the
trustee arranged investments in insurance policies covering pensions in payment due to
members, which significantly reduced the longevity and investment risks for the scheme and

respectively. including the increasing effect of asset ceiling of € 1 million, this led to a net
defined benefit balance of € 1,067 million. therefore, as of june 30, 2020, siemens energy
posted provisions for pensions and similar obligations of € 1,095 million, compared to

certain actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, rate of compensation increase, rate of
pension progression and mortality rates as further set out in note 14 to the audited combined

9.10 disclosure about market and other financial risks
during the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 and the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020,
siemens energy managed and controlled its financial risks in accordance with siemens group
policies. siemens energy (except sgre business) also delegated responsibilities to central
functions of siemens group. following spin-off completion, siemens energy will manage its
financial risks independently from siemens group with substantially similar procedures to the
procedures described below. financial risk management for the sgre business is separately done
onthelevelofsgre.

affectedparticularlybychangesinforeignexchangeratesandinterestrates.inordertooptimize
the allocation of financial resources across siemens energy’s segments and entities, as well as to
achieve its aims, siemens energy identifies, analyzes and manages the associated market risks.
siemens energy seeks to manage and control these risks primarily through its regular operating
andfinancingactivitiesandusesderivativefinancialinstrumentswhendeemedappropriate.
in order to quantify market risks siemens energy utilized a system based on value at risk
(“var”), which is also used for internal management of siemens group corporate treasury
activities.thevarfiguresarecalculatedbasedonhistoricalvolatilitiesandcorrelationsofvarious
risk factors, a ten days holding period, and a 99.5% confidence level. this risk measurement

9.10.2.1 transactionrisk
each siemens energy unit conducting businesses with international counterparties leading to
futurecashflows denominatedin acurrency otherthanits functionalcurrencyisexposedtorisks
from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. in the ordinary course of business siemens
energy entities are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly between
the euro, u.s. dollar, british pound, danish krone and renminbi. foreign currency exchange rate
exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods, commodities and services in the respective
currencies as well as production activities and other contributions along the value chain in the
localmarkets.
the operating units are prohibited from borrowing or investing in foreign currencies on a
speculative basis. financing from siemens group or investments ofoperatingunits arepreferably
carriedoutintheirfunctionalcurrencyoronahedgedbasis.
according to the siemens group policy, siemens energy units (without sgre) are responsible for
recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. the net foreign
currency position of siemens energy (without sgre) units serves as a central performance
measureandhastobehedgedwithinabandofatleast75%butnomorethan100%.thefuture
policy of siemens energy will deviate from siemens group policies to account for siemens
energy’s access to hedging transactions in a stand-alone setup, including its rating as a stand-
alonegroup.
generally, until spin-off completion the siemens energy units (excluding sgre and siemens
energy entities in certain regulated countries, e.g., brazil, turkey) concluded and will continue to
conclude their hedging activities with siemens group treasury. since april 1, 2020, sgre units
concludetheirhedgingactivitieswithexternalcounterparties,only.

as of september 30, 2019, the var relating to foreign currency exchange rates was € 10 million
(september 30, 2018: € 9 million, september 30, 2017: € 12 million). this var was calculated
underconsideration ofitems ofthecombinedstatement offinancial position in additiontofirm
commitments which are denominated in foreign currencies, as well as foreign currency

9.10.2.2 translationrisk
many siemens energy units are located outside the eurozone. because the financial reporting
currency of siemens energy is the euro, the financial statements of these subsidiaries are
translated into euro for the preparation of the combined financial statements. to consider the
effects of foreign currency translation in the risk management, the general assumption is that
investments in foreign-based operations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous.
effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net asset amounts
intoeuroarereflectedinthecombinedstatementsofchangesininvestedequity.
9.10.3 interestraterisk
interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. this risk arises whenever interest terms of
financial assets and liabilities are different. siemens energy’s exposure to the risk of changes in
market interest rates relates in most parts to financial investments and borrowings to siemens
group via siemens group treasury, mainly with fixed rates of interest. historically, long-term
liabilities mainly related to loans with siemens group (except sgre business). sgre mainly uses
externalsourcestofinancepartsofitsoperations,witheitherfixedorvariableinterestrates.
siemensenergy(exceptsgrebusiness)ismainlyfinancedbysiemensgrouptreasuryandinterest
rate risk management is performed at the level of siemens group. consequently, until the
spin-off completion, siemens energy (except sgre business) does not manage its interest rate
risk actively. sgre continuously analyses the split of external financing atvariable andfixed rates
tooptimizeitsinterestrateriskexposure.
as of september 30, 2019, the var relating to the interest rate was € 157 million (september 30,
2018: € 57 million, september 30, 2017: € 123 million). the changes were mainly driven by
changinginterestratevolatilitiesfortheus-dollar.
9.10.4 liquidityrisk
liquidity risk results from siemens energy’s inability to meet its financial liabilities. in the periods
presented,siemens energy(excluding sgre)was largely financedbysiemens groupandinvested
excess liquidity using siemens group’s cash pooling and cash management systems. siemens
energy (excluding sgre) mitigates liquidity risk by the implementation of effective working
capital and cash management as well as the arrangement of credit facilities with financial
institutions. sgre manages liquidity risk independently on the level of sgre, mainly via bank
financing,andinvestsexcessliquiditywithbanks.

9.10.5 creditrisk
credit risk is defined as an unexpected loss in financial instruments if the contractual partner is
failingtodischargeitsobligationsinfullandontimeorifthevalueofcollateraldeclines.
the effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and ratings is a
core competency of siemens energy’s risk management system. in this context, until spin-off
completion,siemensenergyisboundtothecreditpolicyimplementedbysiemensgroup.
siemens group maintains a credit risk intelligence unit to which numerous operating units of
siemens energy regularly transfer business partner data as a basis for a centralized rating and
credit limit recommendation process. due to the identification, quantification and active
managementofcreditrisks,creditrisktransparencyisincreased.
ratings and individually defined credit limits are based on generally accepted rating
methodologies, with information obtainedfromcustomers, externalratingagencies,dataservice
providers and credit default experiences. the ratings used consider appropriate forward-looking
information significant to the specific financial instrument like expected changes in the obligor’s
financial position, shareholders, management or operational risks, as well as broader forward-
looking information, such as expected macroeconomic, industry-related and competitive
developments. a country-specific risk component derived from external country credit ratings is
alsoconsidered.
an exposure is considered defaulted if the obligor is unwilling or unable to pay its credit
obligations. a range of internally defined events trigger a default rating, including the opening
of bankruptcy proceedings, receivables due past 90 days or a default rating by an external rating
agency.
to analyze and monitor credit risks, siemens energy applies various systems and processes. until
spin-off, a main element is a central it application of siemens group that processes data from
operating units together with rating and default information and calculates an estimate which
may be used as a basis for individual bad debt provisions. after spin-off, siemens energy will
continue to receive such information from siemens group under a service level agreement.
198
additionally, qualitative information is considered, to particularly incorporate latest
developments.
the carrying amount is the maximum exposure to afinancial assets’ credit risk. collateral reduces
the valuation allowance to the extent it mitigates credit risk. collateral needs to be specific,
identifiableandlegallyenforceabletobetakenintoaccount.
as of september 30, 2019, collateral of € 97 million (september 30, 2018: € 67 million,
september 30, 2017: € 35 million) related to financial assets measured at fair value. those
collaterals are off-setting positions for derivatives providing protection from the risk of a
counterparty’s insolvency. as of september 30, 2019, collateral held for financial assets measured
at amortized cost were € 333 million (september 30, 2018: € 372 million, september 30, 2017:
€ 283 million), comprising letters of credit, guarantees and credit insurance policies. as of
september 30, 2019, collateral held for contract assets were € 14 million (september 30, 2018:
€ 30 million, september 30, 2017: € 0 million), comprising letters of credit (september 30, 2018:
guarantees).
trade receivables of siemens energy units are generally rated internally; as of september 30,
2019, approximately 38% had an investment grade rating and 62% had a non-investment grade
rating. contract assets generally show similar risk characteristics as trade receivables in operating
units.

10.3 underlying principles
the profit forecast was prepared in accordance with the principles of the institute of public
auditors in germany (institut der wirtschaftsprüfer in deutschland e. v. – “idw”) in idw
accounting practice statement: preparation of forecasts and estimates in accordance with the
specific requirements of the regulation on prospectuses (idw acps aab 2.003) (idw
rechnungslegungshinweis: erstellung von gewinnprognosen und -schätzungen nach den
besonderenanforderungenderprospektverordnung(idwrhhfa2.003)).
although adjusted ebita margin before special items is not an ifrs measure of operating
income, operating performance or liquidity, the adjusted ebita margin before special items
forecast was prepared on the basis of ifrs as adopted by the european union. with respect to
the accounting policies applied, reference is made to the notes to the audited combined
financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 of
siemens energy and with respect to ifrs 16 – “leases” applied for the purpose of the profit
forecast, reference is made to the unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements
ofsiemensenergyasofandforthenine-monthperiodendedjune30,2020.
the profit forecast has been prepared solely for theinclusion in this prospectus for theadmission
to trading of the company’s shares and represents our best estimate as of the date of the profit
forecast (september 3, 2020). in preparing the profit forecast, we have considered a number of
factors to take into account the operational and financial performance for the profit forecast.
theexpecteddevelopmentofthesefactorsisbasedonassumptionsmadebytheexecutiveboard

10.4 factors beyond our control and related assumptions
the profit forecast is subject to factors beyond our control. these factors, and our assumptions
taken about their impact, are described below and account for the group, the gas and power
segmentandthesgresegment:
a)unforeseeneventssuchasforcemajeure
we assume that no material unforeseen events will occur that could result in material or lasting
constraints for the ongoing operations of the group and the segments, such as force majeure
202
(e.g., fire, floods, hurricanes, storms, earthquakes, war and acts of terror, pirates or a further
pandemic;forcovid-19pleaserefertothefollowingsection).
b)economicdevelopment,covid-19andoilprice
our business operations cover core markets in nearly all countries / regions all over the world.
changes in economic growth rates in countries or regions might influence the size of our
addressedmarkets,and,asaresult,ourbusinessvolumeandprofitabilitylevels.
we are directly and, through our customers and supply chain, indirectly exposed to global and
local spreads of covid-19 and the recent oil price developments by impacts on our addressed
markets as well as by measures aimed at limiting their impact, including restrictions on travel,
imposition of quarantines, prolonged closures of workplaces as well as short-time work and
similar measures, curfews or other social distancing measures. we expect the pandemic and
lower oil price level to result in volatility for our addressed markets, in particular with respect to
customercapitalexpenditures,supplychaindelaysandprojecttimingcomparedtothefiscalyear
2019. we assume that the oil price will continue to recover, however will still be substantially
below the pre-covid-19 levels in the fiscal year 2020 and the fiscal year 2021. we assume both
the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to be negatively impacted, however the impact is expected to
differ among our businesses. especially, due to covid-19, we expect a negative impact on
economic growth worldwide. we assume a negative global economic impact for the fiscal year
2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019 and a recovering global economic situation for the fiscal
year2021comparedtothefiscalyear2020.weassumethatthereisnosecondwaveofcovid-19
or a significant prolongation of the current pandemic leading to comprehensive lockdown
measures as experienced in the first half of 2020. due to our business mix, we expect the impact

c)foreigncurrencytranslation
our adjusted ebita margin before special items forecast is based on exchange rate assumptions
and foreign exchange translation from local currency to euro. based on current forward rates at
planning date, we assume the following most relevant average exchanges rates for the fiscal
years2020and2021:
forthefiscalyearendedseptember30,
2020 2021
usd/eur .......................................... 1.12 1.09
dkk/eur .......................................... 7.46 7.45
gbp/eur........................................... 0.88 0.90
cny/eur. .......................................... 7.87 7.88
d)foreigncurrencytransactionsandhedging
hedging of foreign currency transaction risks generally follows siemens ag guidelines and the
siemens ag hedging approach which enables natural hedges, with anticipation of planned
changes for the siemens energy hedging approach after spin-off. we assume higher costs of
hedging related to a different credit rating for siemens energy and therefore a negative
contribution to our adjusted ebita margin before special items in the fiscal year 2021 for both
segments.
due to siemens ag ceasing control over siemens energy with spin-off completion, significant
hedgingpositionsforthesiemensenergybusinessesneedtobeeitherterminatedandre-hedged
at market-rates with the central siemens energy treasury department or novated to the central
siemens energy treasury department within a certain period near spin-off date. based on the

forthefiscalyear2020andforthefiscalyear2021,weassumeastablepoliticalenvironmentand
nomaterialchangesinthelegalandregulatoryframeworkorregulatoryactionstowhichweare
or may become subject to, such as support schemes for renewables, tariffs or tax laws. we
assume protective measures due to international trade disputes to remain on the level of the
fiscal year 2019. we do not expect to lose our current access to our most relevant markets dueto
newly imposed trade barriers in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021. furthermore, we assume no
significant adverse effects resulting from political, legislative and other regulatory matters.
moreover, we assume no significant adverse effects resulting from interpretation of existing or
newtaxregulations.
f)competitionandpricing
price pressure by customers and competitors are major factors to our business. in our service
business, we see that competitors are increasingly targeting to grow business related to third-
party installations, i.e., also siemens energy, which might affect our revenues from the installed
base.forselectedbusinesses,weexpectahigherpricepressure.weassumeanegativeimpacton
adjusted ebita margin before special items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 compared to the
fiscalyear2019.
g)energydemand
we assume an overall lower electricity and gas consumption for the fiscal year 2020 compared to
the fiscal year 2019, due to the shutdown effects as a result of the covid-19 crisis. we also
assume that these effects will partially be compensated by a higher energy demand in the field
of data center or digital media supply. overall, we expect a negative impact for our adjusted
ebita margin before special items forecast in the fiscal year 2020 compared to the fiscal year
2019.
for the fiscal year 2021, we expect an increased electricity and gas consumption compared to the
fiscal year 2020 but still slightly below the electricity and gas consumption of the fiscal year 2019
due to the expected economic recovery as well as from acceleration in digitalization. overall, we
expect a slightly negative impact for our adjusted ebita margin before special items forecast in
thefiscalyear2021comparedtofiscalyear2019.
h)weatherconditions
we assume weather conditions for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 similar to those in the fiscal
year2019andthereforenoimpactonouradjustedebitamarginbeforespecialitems.
i)decarbonizationandmarkettrends
driven by global climate change, there is a new trend towards environmentally-friendly
technologies. we assume that these market trends are leading to new applications and new
businessopportunities.tostrengthenourdecarbonizationportfolio,wehavelaidafocusonnew
products and projects (e.g., industry greenfield captive power, sf -free high-voltage equipment,
6
utility brownfield transformation for utilities or concepts for fully decarbonized island solutions).
moreover, we built up external partnerships and additional decarbonization specific
competencies. we assume continuous growth in these new business areas, depending on the
further development of the energy transition, with a positive contribution to adjusted ebita
margin before special items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2019.
we further assume a positive impact resulting from our wind power portfolio due to a market
shift towards green energy which is expected to positively impact our adjusted ebita margin
beforespecialitemsforecast.
204
increasing decarbonization might redirect parts of the customer’s capital expenditure towards
higher share of renewables (in some of our businesses) and investments in higher efficiency
portfolio of our conventional businesses, limit access to financing of fossil fuels and power
generation projects, or lead to cancellation of projects. the hydrogen economy offers
decarbonization business opportunities while at the same time we need to invest in respective
technologies and business models. in certain conventional businesses, we assume that these
changes will negatively impact our results and therefore contribute negatively to our adjusted
ebitamarginbeforespecialitemsforecastcomparedtothefiscalyear2019.
j)commoditypricesandsupplyofrawmaterials
the group purchases a broad range of materials, components and parts relating to its
manufacturing activities. hence, the operating profitability is affected by the volatility and
partially by related price hedging in several raw material prices such as copper, aluminum and
zinc.
we assume that the commodity prices of some of the most relevant commodities for the fiscal
years2020and2021willonaverageincreaseascomparedtothefiscalyear2019.
we further assume no severe shortages in the supply of our most relevant commodities for the
fiscalyears2020and2021exceptfortemporaryshortageduetocovid-19.
k)workforce
we assume that we will continue to be able to hire the highly qualified personnel we require in
order to ensure that we continue to have adequate technical and operational capabilities as
comparedtothefiscalyear2019.
l)it-systemandlicenses
as part of the carve-out several it-systems need to be taken over from siemens ag or are being
newly implemented. new it-licenses for these systems need to be acquired from various vendors.
in the past siemens ag purchased these licenses centrally and realized large volume rebates
which we will not be able to realize to this extent. we assume the increased costs for the
implementation of our new it-systems and the purchase of new licenses leading to a decrease in
adjustedebitamarginbeforespecialitemsforecastcomparedtothefiscalyear2019.
m)ratingandguaranteecosts
for siemens gamesa renewable energy, s.a., zamudio, spain, which together with its
consolidated subsidiaries forms our sgre segment, we assume that the pricing of bank
guarantees remains substantially unchanged. siemens energy ag as a stand-alone entity has
been awarded a solid investment-grade rating, however, lower than the rating of siemens ag.
overall, weexpectanincreaseincommissions forbankguaranteesandforremainingguarantees
issued by siemens or under siemens bank facilities in the lower two-digit basis point area for the
fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2019. furthermore, due to increasing costs for
project-related guarantees, primarily for guarantees issued by siemens ag, and therefore a
cumulative catch-up impact, we assume a negative impact on our adjusted ebita margin before
specialitemsforthefiscalyear2020.
n)partnering
despite temporary challenges due to covid-19, we assume no default or liquidity constraints of
any of our partners (including but not limited to joint venture partners, consortium partners,
customers and suppliers) at this point in time and that our partners with significant scope are
executingaccordingtotheirlegalobligations.
o)insurance
from the first fiscal year after spin-off completion, we assume higher insurance costs for
siemens energy (excluding the sgre segment) stand-alone programs due to an expected
205
hardened insurance market-environment, loss of joint purchasing power and loss of shared
capacities with siemens. we assume a negative impact on adjusted ebita margin before special
itemsforthefiscalyear2021.
p)equityinvestmentsinshareholding
we hold interest in minority shareholdings in several entities, from some of which we expect
positive returns to positively impact our adjusted ebita margin before special items primarily in
the fiscal year 2021. proceeds from those investments depend on the actual performance of the
respective entity which is beyond our control and might adversely impact our adjusted ebita
marginbeforespecialitemsforecast.
q)customerbehavior
wehavesomeprojectsinourbacklogwhichcurrentlyarebeingre-evaluatedwiththecustomers.
we assume a reasonable customer behavior and therefore no negative contribution to adjusted
ebitamarginbeforespecialitemsinthefiscalyears2020and2021.
10.5 factors that can be influenced by us and related assumptions
in addition to the factors that are beyond our control, the following factors that can be
influenced by the company may also affect the defined adjusted ebita margin before special
itemsforecast:
10.5.1 gasandpowersegment
a)costproductivity
we have implemented and will continue to implement several cost efficiency programs to
improve the cost of goods sold ratio and the selling, general and administrative expenses ratio
compared to the fiscal year 2019. due to covid-19, we assume a negative impact on adjusted
ebita margin before special items for the fiscal year 2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019. for
the fiscal year 2021, we assume to achieve the anticipated timing and volume of these cost
productivity measures and therefore a positive contribution to adjusted ebita margin before
specialitemscomparedtothefiscalyear2020.
b)globalfootprintchanges
we have been implementing a series of restructuring programs aimed at optimizing our global
footprint, increasing factory utilization rates compared to the fiscal year 2019, streamlining our
internalprocesses,supplychainmanagement,andprojectexecution.also,weexpecttodrivethe
profitability of the divisions through further cost-out programs, optimizing portfolio and
enhancing organizational efficiency. we assume that we reach the anticipated timing and the
volume of these productivity measures and therefore expect the savings from these measures to
have a positive impact on adjusted ebita margin before special items while related
non-personnel restructuring costs are assumed to have a negative impact on adjusted ebita
marginbeforespecialitems,bothinthefiscalyear2020and,toalargerdegree,inthefiscalyear
2021.
c)supplychain
we have significant quantitative and qualitative dependencies on key suppliers (e.g., single
source situation). this could result in a lack of such supplies which could trigger clear additional
costs due to delays, rework or redesign. except for the changes described below, we assume no
changes of our cost structure for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 in this respect compared to the
fiscalyear2019.
furthermore, compared to the fiscal year 2019 we assume a moderate increase in purchasing
price for some of our commodities (e.g., specific products like blades) due to consolidation in the
respective supplier market leading to a negative contribution to our adjusted ebita margin
beforespecialitemsinthefiscalyears2020and2021.
206
10.5.2 sgresegment
a)costproductivity
wehaveimplementedandcontinuetoimplementcostefficiencyprogramsinthefiscalyear2020
to improve productivity compared to the fiscal year 2019. we assume to reach the anticipated
timing and volume of these productivity measures in the fiscal year 2021. we assume these
programs to have a positive impact on productivity and will therefore positively contribute to
adjustedebitamarginbeforespecialitemsinthefiscalyears2020and2021tothesameextent.
b)globalfootprintchanges
we are continuously evaluating our global manufacturing footprint to ensure an efficient and
effective setup, however, also ensuring no significant dependency from certain countries. local
content requirements must be taken into account. we assume no changes in impact on our
adjusted ebita margin before special items forecast in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 compared
tothefiscalyear2019.
c)businessmodelinindia
we are currently reshaping our business model in india to lower future risk exposure. we expect
that the restructuring program will affect our operational business in india and therefore we
assume a negative impact on adjusted ebita margin before special items in the fiscal years 2020
and2021comparedtothefiscalyear2019.
d)manufacturingquality
product quality weaknesses resulting from design or manufacturing phase may result in cost
increases during project execution (installation) and following service tenure. furthermore, the
timing for market entry of new products is decisive for market success and subsequently
profitability related. we assume a stable product quality and therefore no changes in impact on
adjusted ebita margin before special items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 compared to the
fiscalyear2019.
e)pricing
prices for products and subsequently projects may be underestimated during bidding phase in
case of unforeseen events (e.g., raw material cost increases, supply chain shortages). we assume
no impact on adjusted ebita margin before special items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021
comparedtothefiscalyear2019.
f)supplychain
for certain supplies we have significant dependencies on key suppliers (e.g., single-source
situation). this could result in a lack of such supplies which could then trigger significant
additional costs due to delays, rework or redesign. we assume no changes of our cost structure
and therefore no changes in impact on adjusted ebita margin before special items in the fiscal
years2020and2021comparedtothefiscalyear2019.
g)synergies
we assume first synergies, based on a closer collaboration (e.g., related to procurement and
other opportunities) between the sgre segment, the gas and power segment and siemens ag,
to have a positive impact on adjusted ebita margin before special items in the fiscal year 2021
comparedtothefiscalyear2019.
10.5.3 grouplevel
a)projectexecution
project execution issues from our side or the side of our partners might result in
non-conformance costs and other project charges. we assume anticipated cost overruns and
207
various anticipated shifts of project milestones which will negatively impact our adjusted ebita
margin before special items forecast for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 compared to the fiscal
year2019.
b)technicalandqualityissues
products, product groups or solutions – both manufactured and sourced – might face risks
associated with technical or quality failures that we mitigate with appropriate levels of project
contingencies and warranties. we assume a negative impact on adjusted ebita margin before
special items forecast from technical and quality failures for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021
comparedtothefiscalyear2019.
c)equityinvestmentsinprojects
the group is considering to selectively invest into (energy) projects with potentially not
insignificant amounts. such equity investments are typically exposed to fluctuations which can
impact the group’s profits. such risks are, inter alia, project-specific risks, country risks and
currency risks. the group’s profits can also be impacted positively in case such projects perform
above expectations. we assume a positive impact on the adjusted ebita margin before special
itemsfromallmajorequityinvestmentsforthefiscalyears2020and2021.
d)employeeincentives
we have implemented and plan to implement several incentive programs including share-based
compensation, retention and share matching program. the estimated costs have been reflected
in our adjusted ebita margin before special items forecast for the fiscal year 2021.weassumea
stablebaseofentitledemployeesandparticipantsintheplan.changestothatbasecouldhavea
positiveornegativeimpactontheadjustedebitamarginbeforespecialitems.
e)pensions
the group’s future costs related to pension plans include estimations of future contributions to
defined contribution plans as well as estimation of future service costs for defined benefit plans
with an assumed negative impact on the adjusted ebita margin before special items for the
fiscal years 2020 and 2021. in both cases, the actual future costs may deviate from the estimates.
sources for uncertainty may be market volatility (e.g., changes in discount rates for defined
benefit plans), movements in the participating population or changes in the plan rules, either
causedbythecompany’sdecisionorrequiredbychangesintherespectivelegislation.
in addition to these direct costs of pension plans, the future costs include estimates of future
indirect costs such as costs of the company’s pension management function, pension related
consulting fees, insolvency protection fees, plan provider costs etc. these indirect costs may also
changeinthefuture.
f)itintegrationcosts
we assume ongoing costs for the integration of our new it landscape for the fiscal year 2020.
we assume these costs to increase in the fiscal year 2021 due to a new function setup and
therefore a negative impact on adjusted ebita margin before special items for the fiscal year
2021.
g)rebatesbysiemensgroup
we assume rebates being granted by siemens group for its shared services for the fiscal year
2021.weassumetoachievetheagreedvolumesandthereforeapositiveimpactonouradjusted
ebitamarginbeforespecialitems.
h)margin-relatedbrandfee
a margin-related brand fee scheme on staggered royalty basis has been implemented from the
fiscal year 2020 onwards. we assume a negative impact on our adjusted ebita margin before
208
special items for the fiscal year 2020andthefiscal year2021duetothebrandfeepayableunder
thisroyaltyscheme.
i)stand-alonefunctionsetup
preparing siemens energy as a stand-alone group requires the setup of certain functions and
capabilities that were provided by siemens in the past as described above, e.g., related to
corporate activities and governance. accordingly, we assume certain personnel and
non-personnel costs related to the transfer of those functions and capabilities from siemens ag
to siemens energy as well as a need to acquire additional resources to manage the systems and
processes assumed from siemens ag during the carve out. this also includes certain corporate
services that siemens ag will provide and charge to siemens energy. we assume that our
adjusted ebita margin before special items will be negatively impacted by related costs for the
fiscal years 2020 and 2021 compared to 2019. furthermore, we also assume to drive profitability
by a potential new functional set-up for which we assume restructuring costs in the fiscal year
2021.
j)acquisitions
we assume no major acquisitions and divestments scheduled at current with an impact on
adjusted ebita margin before special items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 compared to the
fiscalyear2019.
k)revenuedevelopment
the factor revenue growth is a key factor to adjusted ebita margin before special items and
servesthegroupandsegmentsasmainplanningmeasureforfuturebusinessdevelopments.
revenue growth rate for the group shows the development of our revenue as reported and
shown in our financial statements and revenue growth rate for the segments shows the
development of our segment’s reported total revenue. “revenuegrowth rate” is defined as the
percentage change year-over-year which is calculated by dividing the absolute revenue
difference between a base year and the previous period by the previous period revenue. we do
not adjust revenue growth rate for potential effects from portfolio transactions and or
implicationsfromcurrencyeffects.
weassumerevenuegrowthratesasfollows:

segment’srevenuegrowthrateforthesgresegment ... (7)%–(2)% 3%–12%
(a)revenuegrowth/developmentongasandpowerlevel
we assume that our order backlog that has already been booked represents a solid basis for
future revenue generation for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 and that such order backlog is
converted into revenue as anticipated. for our profit forecast in the fiscal year 2021we assumea
stable development of our transactional business (especially service) compared to the fiscal year
2020. we also assume a book-to-bill ratio above 1 for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 and
thereforeassumeacontinuedexpansionofourorderbacklog.
we assume that our broad and diverse customer base and installed fleet contributes to the
resilience of our business in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021. we assume no significant shift in our
portfolio mix in the fiscal year 2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019 and for the fiscal year 2021
comparedtothefiscalyear2020.
209
for the fiscal year 2020 we assume a moderate revenue decline compared to the fiscal year 2019,
primarily driven by covid-19 impacts. for the fiscal year 2021, we assume a return to revenue
growthcomparedtothefiscalyear2020duetoexpectedrecoveryfromthecovid-19pandemic.
we assume that our existing new unit orders together with our service business form the basis
for our revenue growth in the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020. with more than
40% revenue contribution, we expect our service business to remain a crucial revenue source in
thegasandpowersegment.
we do not assume significant impacts on our revenue growth in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021
basedonshort-termdeviationsoftheoilprice.
(b)revenuegrowth/developmentonsgrelevel
we consider our revenue in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to be highly driven by the conversion
from our existing order backlog, which presents a solid basis for our revenue development. we
assume that such order backlog is converted into revenue as anticipated. we assume that order
growth, in particular in the offshore business, supports the revenue development in the fiscal
year 2021. for our profit forecast for the fiscal year 2021, we further assume a stable
developmentofourserviceandproductbusinessfortheremainingportionthatisnotcoveredby
thealreadycontractuallyagreedorderbacklogcomparedtothefiscalyear2019.
our revenue sources depend on the sgre business mix (onshore, offshore and service). for the
fiscal year 2020, we assume an increased onshore and service contribution to our overall slightly
decreased revenue compared to the fiscal year 2019. we expect that all businesses will positively
contribute to our revenue growth in the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020, with
offshoreandservicebeingthemaindriver.
therevenuegrowthrateisinfluencedbyweatherconditions.forthefiscalyears2020and2021,
we assume normal weather conditions compared to the average of the last five to ten years and
thereforeweassumenoimpactonourrevenuedevelopment.
new trends towards environmentally friendly technologies are driven by global climate change.
we assume that these market trends are leading to new applications and new business with a
positive impact on our revenue development (in onshore, offshore and service) in the fiscal year
2020comparedtothefiscalyear2019andthefiscalyear2021comparedtothefiscalyear2020.
regarding the restructuring of our business model in india, we assume a negative impact to our
revenue development in the fiscal year 2020 and the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year
2019 considering latest reduced onshore market development based on market volume and
market share assumptions. moreover, we assume an unfavorable impact on our onshore market
developments in mexico which will negatively impact our revenue development in the fiscal year
2020.
neither a positive nor a negative contribution to the revenue growth rate with regards to
customer behavior is expected as we assume a stable customer behavior (e.g., project scope
alterations) for the fiscal year 2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019 and the fiscal year 2021
comparedtothefiscalyear2020.
in the fiscal year 2020 we acquired the senvion deutschland gmbh as well as the portuguese
blade factory ria blades, s.a. we assume a positive contribution from this acquisition to our
revenuegrowthrateinthefiscalyears2020and2021mainlyaffectingourservicebusiness.
(c)revenuegrowthongrouplevel
as we are exposed to global and local spreads of covid-19 and the recent oil price
developments, project schedules might shift, customer acceptance might be reached at a later
stage or projects are already or might be postponed due to customer’s capital expenditures. we
do not assume a full market recovery with regards to covid-19 and the oil price until the end of
thefiscalyear2021.
210
we do not assume changes in contract options that will affect our contract volumes and
therefore we do not assume an impact on our revenue growth rate. customers might
renegotiate prices for existing contracts (especially long-term projects) which might affect
revenues. for selected businesses, we assume a higher price pressure by customers and
competitors and therefore a negative impact on our revenue growth rate for the fiscal year
2020comparedtothefiscalyear2019andthefiscalyear2021comparedtothefiscalyear2020.
we do not assume an impact on revenue growth rate forecast from project execution for the
fiscalyears2020and2021duetounpredictablerisksandassociatedchangesinplancosts.
we assume no major acquisitions and divestments with an impact on our revenue growth rate
for the remainder of the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, except the once already publicly disclosed
(i.e.,senvion).
10.6 other explanatory notes
the profit forecast and estimate has been compiled and prepared on a basis which is both:
(a) comparable with the historical financial information of siemens energy and (b) consistent
withsiemensenergyag’saccountingpolicies.
the profit forecast covers results from some extraordinary events or results from non-recurring
operations within the meaning of idw rh hfa 2.003, such as effects related to the covid-19
pandemic, from a cumulative catch-up impact due to increased costs for project guarantees and
the change of parts of expenses resulting from cost savings programs to the extent not excluded
intheprofitforecastasstatedabove.
as the profit forecast relates to periods that have not ended yet and is based on several
assumptions regarding uncertain future events and actions, it inherently involves considerable
uncertainties. as a result of such uncertainties, the actual group’s adjusted ebita margin before
special items and/or each segment’s adjusted ebita margin before special items for the fiscal
year 2020 and/or the fiscal year 2021 may deviate from the respective adjusted ebita margin
beforespecialitemsforecast,evensubstantially.

11 industry overview
with our gas and power segment (including the transmission, generation and industrial
applications divisions and other operations) and with our sgre segment, we operate in various
markets, mainly relating to the energy sector. as far as we are aware, there are no
comprehensive sources describing the precise markets that siemens energy covers with its gas
andpowerportfolio.however,therearevariousgovernment,marketresearchandotherpublicly
available sources, including reports by independent industry publications, covering underlying
markets, or individual markets or markets segments, which we consider as part of our own
market assessment (see also “4.5 sources of market data and other information from third
parties”).wheremarketportionsrelevanttoourbusinessarenotseparatelyreportedinavailable
market reports or the therein reported scope does not match our portfolio, we use our own
proprietary assessments and calculations. the following information on market environment,
market developments, market volumes and the competitive situation, in particular the data
relating to our addressed transmission market, our addressed generation market and our
addressed industrial applications market, as defined in this chapter, represents our aggregation
of diverse external and internal data and estimates. the respective definitions and assessments
for our addressed transmission market, our addressed generation market and our addressed
industrial applications market, as defined in this chapter, are largely based on the businesses
that we operate in and the main products, solutions and services that we offer and for which we
believe a market can be reasonably assessed. our internal market assessments have not been
verified by a third party. the actual market and competitive environment may differ from our
assessment and other market participants or market research companies (which may also use a
different market definition, product-based split and/or methodology) may have a different view.
to the extent not otherwise indicated, the information contained herein with regard to the
environment, developments, growth rates, trends and competitors in the markets in which we
operate, is based on our assessments. these assessments, in turn, are based in part on our
internal observations of the market, independent and publicly available market sources. the
informationonthewindenergymarket,relevanttothebusinessofoursgrereportingsegment,
islargelybasedonseveralthird-partyreports.
in addition, all assessments regarding future developments and trends in the markets described
in this chapter are subject to additional uncertainties relating to the impact of the covid-19
pandemic, a major disruptive factor, and its various related effects: the pandemic creates
significant and uncertain volatility in macroeconomic factors such as the development of gross
domestic product (“gdp”), oil and natural gas prices, a pronounced decrease in energy demand,
country and customer financial capacity, energy investment, government stimulus and energy
policies, as well as volatility in the financial markets. in turn, these factors are expected tohavea
further impact on the market drivers for our business. the above-mentioned factors make our
own and market experts’ projections difficult to assess. our own market assessments for our
addressed transmission market, our addressed generation market and our addressed industrial
applications market, as defined in this chapter, are based on our latest comprehensive annual
market update, which relates to market data compiled as of february/march 2020; these figures
do not consider the potential impact of the covid-19 pandemic and the most recent
development of oil prices. to the extent relevant information was available, certain qualitative
updates on expected market development trends were performed thereafter. similarly, the
external sources cited in this chapter, including with respect to the wind energy market relevant
to the sgre business, have been published on different dates (as stated in each case) and such
sources have not always published updates to account for later developments, in particular for
the covid-19 pandemic and related factors mentioned above, or have done so to varying
extents. unless otherwise stated, statements in the prospectus based on sources published before
theoutbreakofthecovid-19pandemicandtheplummetingofoilpricesdonotyetconsiderthe
impacts related to these factors. where sources have published updates based on such major
disruptive factors, they have generally stated that any forward-looking information is subject to
uncertainties, so that such updates may turn out in hindsight to be inaccurate. the markets may
turn out to be more deeply affected by such disruptive factors (or other disruptive factors which
212
may arise in the future) than currently anticipated, and the current projections may differ from
newerprojectionswhichmaybereleasedatalatertimeandfromactualdevelopments.

11.1 introduction to the energy sector
11.1.1 overview
theenergysectorencompassesallindustriesinvolvedinthesupplyofenergyandthereforeplays
a crucial role in infrastructure and the development of societies worldwide. modern society
consumes large amounts of different forms of energy (e.g., fuels, electricity (also referred to as
“power”), heat and hydrogen) supplied by energy systems, which are based on fossil, nuclear or
renewables.theseenergysystemstargetanaffordable,reliableandsustainableenergysupply.
the common goal to limit ghg emissions, against the background of increasing energy demand,
in order to contain global warming has already led to a transition in the energy mix away from
conventional fossil fuels and towards renewables. this change requires the integration of
renewables and leads to additional complexity of the grid. this transition is accelerated by
megatrends such as globalization and global economic growth, urbanization, demographic
change, climate change and digitalization. these megatrends lead to four important
developments in our markets: demand growth, decarbonization, decentralization and
digitalization. all of these provide opportunities and challenges in our main markets, including
ouraddressedmarkets(whicharedefinedandexplainedlaterinthischapter).
the developments in the energy markets and related technologies are in intensive public
discussion, strongly linked to climate change and the deployment of renewable technologies. on
a long-term perspective (until 2040), there are significantly divergent views regarding the future
development of primary energy demand, the fuel mix and the role of fossil fuel in particular.
those views strongly depend on the assumptions taken, often resulting in a considerable gap
between the committed policy action of governments (in the form of “national determined
contributions” (“ndcs”) under the paris agreement) and the required action to limit global
warmingto“well-below2°c”,asstatedintheparisagreementasanagreedtarget.
while there is a wide range of possible long-term developments for primary energy demand in
the “world energy outlook 2019” report published by the iea in november 2019 (“weo 2019”),
from 1% growth (2018-2040 cagr) in the stated policies scenario to a decline of 0.3% (2018-
2040 cagr) in the sustainable development scenario, theoutlookfor electricity demandis much
more resilient for the two scenarios, with a 2018-2040 cagr of about 2% growth (for more
information on the iea scenarios, see “11.1.3.2 energy trends and transformation of energy
markets”). this gives an indication that the role of electricity is expected to increase in any
scenario and may even develop to become the backbone of energy supply in the foreseeable
future. it also reflects the fact that the power sector (“power” is used as a synonym of
“electricity”), from which about 40% of global carbon emissions originate (41.6% in 2018,
according to weo 2019), is already quite advanced in integrating renewable power generation
technologies, with renewable sources contributing roughly one quarter to the global electricity
generation (in terawatt hours (“twh”); weo 2019, data for 2018). wind power, both onshore
and offshore, is taking the leading role within renewables in terms of investments and power
generation, while pv may show the largest increase in terms of new installations capacity-wise.
for other sectors, e.g., the industry, transport or residential sectors, it is much more difficult to
213
integrate renewable technology. the concept of sector coupling (also referred to as “sector
integration”) takes renewable energy from the power sector and brings it to the other sectors;
thus, the power sector contributes to decarbonize these other sectors. examples include the use
of dissipative heat from thermal power generation for district heating (combined heat and
power, “chp”), e-mobility (e-vehicles), but also more innovative technologies such as
“power-to-hydrogen” with electrolysis and re-electrification with fuel cells, both for mobility
solutions and stationary applications. this underlines the important role of electricity as the
backboneofenergysupplyinafuturedecarbonizedenergysystem.
whiletheintegrationofrenewablesintheglobalelectricitysystemhasalreadyreachedalevelof
approximately 26% of global electricity generation (in twh; weo 2019, data for 2018), further
additions of renewable power generation capacity need to ensure reliability of supply and
affordability of electricity from a consumer’s perspective. the share of “green” electricity in 2040
may range, globally, from 44% in the stated policies scenario to 67% in the sustainable
development scenario (weo 2019) (whereby the pace of renewable energy integration is
expected to vary substantially among different countries and regions), with conventional power
generation capacity to take the balance. this requires the power grid to balance more and more
intermittency of renewable power generated from wind and pv and maintain the power quality
(in terms of stability). in general terms, there are two alternatives to match volatile demand and
supply: flexible electricity generation through gas, and storage to match supply with demand.
weexpectpowergenerationfromgasturbinestoplayanimportantroletoprovidedispatchable
and reliable power even in a widely decarbonized energy system and to complement the
intermittency of renewable power generation. this view is also supported by industry reports:
weo 2019 highlights the importance of considering the potential of future of gas networks to
deliver different types of gas in a low emissions future and their role in ensuring energy security.
in addition, bnef expects a 37% rise in combined-cycle gas turbines, as 506 gw could be added
until 2050, and a 350% increase in peaking gas plants over the same period, which are expected
to account for over 1 tw of capacity by 2050 (source: bnef, “new energy outlook 2019”,
executive summary). having an important role also in a low-carbon energy future, gas turbines
become a sustainable investment, operating with natural gas as a fuel today, and with green
gasessuchashydrogenorsyntheticmethaneinthefuture.
energy storage is a prerequisite to build a widely decarbonized energy system. the preferred
storage technology depends on the individual application and storage time, ranging from
seconds to even seasonal storage. besides battery storage technologies, other forms of energy
storage such as mechanical and thermal energy storage may be used. power-to-hydrogen and
water electrolysis, converting electric energy into hydrogen as a chemical storable energy carrier,
may develop into a universal conversion and storage technology (see also
“11.1.3.2.2decarbonization”).
to reduce carbon emissions of fossil, biomass or biogas incineration processes, carbon capture
may gain importance, in particular in combination with the development of power-to-hydrogen
and the electrolysis technology: captured carbon dioxide (“co ”) may develop to a valuable
2
feedstockforsynthesiswithgreenhydrogenfromelectrolysistoproducesynthetichydrocarbons.
there is an intensive discussion about hydrogen as a key element of a future decarbonized
energy system. hydrogen can be generated from renewable electricity and electrolysis of water,
with electrolyzers as a new and developing technology, or can originate from fossil sources.
hydrogen might be compressed, stored and transported in gas pipelines and used as a fuel for
heatingorpowergenerationwithgasturbinesorfuelcells.
11.1.2 the energy conversion chain
within the energy sector, the traditional energy conversion chain can be split into the following
steps:
(cid:129) exploration, transport and refinement of primary energy carriers (see also “11.4.1.1 the value
chainoftheoil&gasindustryrelevanttoourindustrialapplicationsdivision”);
214
(cid:129) power generation from fossil fuels (like natural gas, fuel oil or coal), nuclear or renewable
sources (see also “11.3.1.1 the power generation industry” and “11.5.2 general market
characteristics,trendsanddrivers”);
(cid:129) power transmission/distribution via the electricity grid (see also “11.2.1.1 transmission and
distributionaspartoftheelectricityindustry”);and
(cid:129) powerconsumptionbyend-users.
each part of the energy value chain has its own specific characteristics, business models and
industry trends, which can differ from country to country. some companies in the energy sector
arepresentinonlyasinglepartofthevaluechain,whileotherscoverseveralparts.
siemens energy provides fully integrated products, systems, solutions and services across the
energy value chain of electricity generation and oil & gas and other process industries, as well as
transmission. in addition, siemens energy holds approximately 67% of the shares in sgre s.a.,
which (together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries) mainly focuses on products (mainly wind
turbines) and services for the wind energy generation industry. this chapter will focus on the
markets relevant to the businesses relating to transmission, generation and industrial
applications (including oil & gas, other process industries and the development of a hydrogen
economy) of our gas and power reporting segment, as well as on the market relevant to our
sgre reporting segment. for more information on siemens energy’s gas and power and sgre
business,see“12business”.
11.1.3 general trends in the energy sector
11.1.3.1 globalmegatrends
the energy sector is subject to an ongoing transition from conventional generation to a larger
share of renewable energy generation, including topics such as integration of renewables and
complexityofthegrid(seealso“11.1.3.2energytrendsandtransformationofenergymarkets”).
thefollowingglobalmegatrendsareacceleratingsuchtransition:
globalizationandglobaleconomicgrowth
globalization represents a main driver for the growth of international trade (in terms of average
of exports and imports). the global trade volume for goods roughly tripled between 2000 and
2019, from approximately usd 6,453 billion in 2000 to approximately usd 18,889 billion in 2019
(source: unctad statistics for total trade/merchandise, annual world volumes, 1948-2019
database published on unctad’s website). globalization, including increasing international
tradeandindustrializationaswellasanexpandingeconomy,contributetodriveenergydemand.
furthermore, in addition to globalization, a trend towards localization can also be observed in
certaincountries,whichmaytranslateintolocalproductionandlocalcontentrequirements.
according to a unctad global trade update on “covid-19 causes international trade to
collapse”, june 11, 2020, the economic and social disruptions brought by covid-19 are resulting
in a substantial decline in trade. the value of international trade in goods has declined by about
5%inthefirstquarterof2020andwasexpectedtodeclineby27%inthesecondquarterof2020
as of the date of the report. assuming persisting uncertainty with respect to the covid-19
pandemic,unctadexpectsadeclineofaround20%fortheyear2020.
accordingtotheimf, asaresultofthepandemic,theglobaleconomyisprojectedtocontractby
-4.9% in 2020 in terms of real gdp compared to 2019 in a baseline scenario, which assumes a
slow recovery path in the second half of 2020 including persistent social distancing, greater
scarring from the larger-than-anticipated hit to activity during lockdown in the first half of 2020
and a negative impact on productivity, as well as that the countries where infections have
declined will not reinstate stringent lockdowns as seen in the first half of 2020 (source: imf,
“world economic outlook update – a crisis like no other, an uncertain recovery”, june 2020).
the contractions mostly reflects a downturn in consumption growth, which has been
downgraded by the imf for most economies. according to the same source, the contraction for
215
2020 will be particularly severe in the advanced economies (-8.0%) and less pronounced in the
group of emerging market and developing economies (-3.0%). under the same scenario, the
global economy is projected to grow by 5.4% in 2021 as economic activity normalizes, helped by
policy support and expected stable financial conditions. national and regional economic stimulus
havebeenproposedorputinplacetomitigateeconomicdownswings.
urbanization
globally, morepeoplelive in urbanareasthaninruralareas,with55%oftheworld’s population
residing in urban areas in 2018. the share of urban population is expected to increase to more
than two-thirds (68%) by 2050 (source for all data: united nations’ “world urbanization
prospects2018–highlights”report(“wup2018”)).
urbanizationisdrivingdemandforfood,waterandenergyinmanyplacesacrosstheglobe.over
the coming decades, the wup 2018 expects that the level of urbanization will increase in all
regions, but with considerable variation. in addition, both the level and pace of urbanization
differ considerably across income groups, according to the wup 2018. sustainable urbanization
requires, among other measures, that cities provide the necessary infrastructure for energy,
transportationandcommunication(wup2018).
demographicchange
according to the united nations’ “world population prospects 2019 – highlights” report (“wpp
2019”), the world’s population continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace than at any time since
1950.from anestimated 7.7billion peopleworldwide in 2019,thewpp2019projectionindicates
that the global population could grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050, and
10.9billionin2100(medium-variantscenario).
another relevant demographic factor relates to the increasing life expectancy. overall, the wpp
2019 projects that average life expectancy at birth (blended for both sexes, world average) will
exceed77yearsin2050,withregionalvariations.
a growing population is one of the main factors (together with an expanding global economy)
behind the increase in energy demand. for more information, see “11.1.3.2.1 demand growth
for energy and electricity”. in addition, continued rapid population growth presents challenges
for sustainable development. the 47 least developed countries are among the world’s fastest
growing, putting pressure on already strained resources and challenging policies aimed at
achievingtheunitednations’sustainabledevelopmentgoals(“sdgs”)(source:wpp2019).
climatechange
the “state of the climate in 2019” report, published august 2020 by the american
meteorological society (“sotc 2019”) provides a detailed update on global climate indicators,
among others, and shows patterns, changes and trends of the global climate system. according
to the sotc 2019, the dominant ghg released into the earth’s atmosphere – co , methane and
2
others – continued to increase in 2019. the annual global average co concentration at the
2
earth’s surface was the highest in the modern instrumental record as well as in ice core records
dating back 800,000 years. combined, ghg and several halogenated gases show an increase of
45% increase since 1990. in addition, in 2019 sea levels rose to record levels for the eighth
consecutive year, the number of tropical storms was well above the 1981-2010 average and
alpine glacier mass continued to decline for the 32nd consecutive year (source for all above
statements:sotc2019).
in the paris agreement agreed in december 2015, 197 parties (196 states plus the european
union) agreed, among others, to limit global warming to “well below 2°c” above pre-industrial
levels and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°c. the participating countries have binding
emission reduction targets. however, as stated in the “global warming of 1.5°c” report
published by the ipcc on october 8, 2018 (“ipcc report”), without increased and urgent
mitigation ambition in the coming years, leading to a sharp decline in ghg emissions by 2030,
216
global warming will surpass 1.5°c in the following decades, leading to irreversible loss of the
mostfragileecosystems,andcrisisaftercrisisforthemostvulnerablepeopleandsocieties.
climate change and decarbonization discussions and the commitment to low or zero emission
standards by countries and companies are gaining traction. the ipcc has stated that emissions
must be cut-down to net zero by around 2050 in order to reach a maximum global warming of
1.5°c(source:ipccreport).
in addition, sustainability and corporate responsibility have become a widespread focus of
attention for companies across different industries, with emission reduction targets, among
others.
digitalization
digitalization opens up new perspectives for businesses regarding integration in a digital
environment and where the use of data becomes important for purposes of reducing costs,
increasing revenue and improving service quality and integrating customers and business
partnersinthesupplychain.
in addition, large data centers and it infrastructure consume significant electricity volumes.
accordingtoanhsbcstudy, datacenters were estimated tohaveused284twh(oraround1.3%
of total electricity consumption) in 2017. data centers’ electricity consumption is expected to
more than double by 2025, to reach 720 twh, and then more than double again to reach nearly
1,700twh(or5.7%oftotalglobalelectricityusage)by2030,inbothcasesunderthestudy’sbase
scenario(source:hsbcglobalresearch,“poweringthedatarevolution–thestrainsfacingglobal
electricity”,may2019).
withdigitalization gainingimportance,thefocusoncybersecurityisalsoincreasing.withrespect
to the energy sector, the increasingly complex grids are more prone to cyberattacks, making
cybersecurity a key issue to ensure a secure energy supply. cybersecurity also plays an important
roleintheareaofremoteservicesforpowerplants.
for information on how digitalization is impacting energy markets, see “11.1.3.2.4 digitalization
intheenergymarkets”below.
11.1.3.2 energytrendsandtransformationofenergymarkets
the energy industry is experiencing significant transformation. the traditional power (i.e.,
electricity) supplymodelwasbasedonacentralized,conventionalelectricitygenerationstructure
(with dispatchable conventional power plants satisfying power demand) and unidirectional grids
(with electricity usually being transmitted from large-scale generators to consumers). the
economics of generation technology ensured a stable business for conventional energy
generationcompanies;inturn,thesystemensuredconstantavailabilityofelectricity.
this traditional model is now being challenged at many levels. there are challenges arising from
the rapid deployment of electricity generation from renewables: the world energy supply
continues to transition towards an affordable, reliable and sustainable model. due to the very
low cost of most renewable power generation technologies (e.g., wind, pv and hydro) in many
jurisdictions compared to conventional power generation technologies as well as support
schemes (e.g., preferential feed-in), conventional power plants increasingly provide only the
balance between power demand and renewable power generation and therefore operate with
less operating hours than in the past. the generation mix that is fed to the grid is more volatile
and thus driving grid complexity, with a need to ensure regional supply and to balance demand.
in addition, gas can play an important role as a transition technology, since it has the advantage
of having lower specific co emissions per kilowatt-hour (“kwh”) electricity produced in
2
combined-cycleapplicationscomparedtooilorcoalasafuel.
the transformation outlined above is driven by changes in market economics and regulatory
frameworks as well as more engaged customers and competitors, and many new trends in the
217
energy sector are also derived or closely correlated with the megatrends described above. for
example:
(cid:129) investors are increasingly shifting their capital to sustainable funds, and banks are revising
their policies to limit or avoid financing of conventional power generation projects. moreover,
under an update to the eib’s energy lending policy, the eib announced in november 2019 that
it will end financing for fossil fuel energy projects as from the end of 2021. it also set a new
emissions performance standard of 250gco perkwh,which acts asaneligibility threshold for
2
thefinancingofpowergenerationprojects.
(cid:129) governments and eu bodies are setting new frameworks, led by commitments such as those
included in the paris agreement, with many governments setting ambitious targets to cut
carbonemissionsandadoptotherclimate-friendlymeasures.moreover,coal-firedpowerplants
are being phased out in certain countries. in addition, several countries have published
national hydrogen strategies, including australia, switzerland and germany (see also
“11.1.3.2.2decarbonization”).
(cid:129) companies and industries are making ambitious pledges, for example with respect to
sustainability targets. the “science-based targets initiative” (“sbti”) and “re100” are two
critical ways through which companies around the world are committing to climate goals.
science-basedtargetsprovidecompanieswithaclearlydefinedpathwaytosustainablegrowth
by specifying how much and how quickly they need to reduce their ghg emissions. many
industrial companies have set ambitious emissions reductions and other environmentally-
friendlytargets.
(cid:129) finally, public opinion is also increasingly pushing the adoption of more ambitious
environmentally-friendly measures, as seen lately with the “fridays for future” rallies in many
countries. in addition, customers are increasingly factoring environmental practices of
companiesintotheirpurchasingdecisions.
the transformation, as outlined above, is prompting changes in the industries in which siemens
energy is active. among others, oil & gas companies are striving to reduce their net carbon
footprint and to achieve a carbon-efficient oil & gas production (including attaining near
zero-emissions in the near-term and, in some cases, investing in renewables). power generation
companies are switching from coal to gas, supported by low gas prices and increasing carbon
prices, or due to regulations, and are also investing in renewables, such as on-andoffshorewind
as well as solar pv. in addition, municipal utilities are investing in decentral energy sources and
renewables as well as energy storage, and focusing on new technologies such as co- or
tri-generation (coupling heating, cooling and electricity), flexible solutions to allow for a fast
ramp-up or ramp-down and mobile solutions. moreover, grid operators are investing into
solutions addressing the challenges of connecting renewables to the grid and enabling grid
stability, such as flexible alternating current transmission systems (“facts”) and synchronous
condensers, as well as replacing environmentally harmful or conventional assets with
environmentally-friendlyalternatives,suchassf -freeswitchgears.

the iea’s weo 2019 analyzes the energy trends and transformation of energy markets in
different scenarios. it should be noted that none of these scenarios constitute a forecast nor can
an assessment be made on the likelihood for any of the scenarios. the description on energy
demand, electricity generation and other relevant parameters in this chapter is largely based on
thestatedpoliciesscenarioandthesustainabledevelopmentscenario:
(cid:129) the “stated policies scenario” (which is the main iea scenario and was known until the 2018
edition of the iea’s world energy outlook report as “new policies scenario”) encompasses
currently announced policy intentions and targets in addition to existing measures. this is a
scenariobasedonthecommittedpolicyofgovernments.
(cid:129) the “sustainable development scenario” is described by the iea as providing an integrated
strategy to achieve the key energy-related elements of the united nations sustainable
development agenda, including energy access, air quality and climate objectives, and with the
218
emissions trajectory being fully in line with achieving the long-term objectives of the paris
agreement.
there are different measures used in the weo 2019 and other studies that are relevant. capacity
additions (expressed in gw) relate to the installation of new power plant capacity and therefore
are relevant for the market development relating to new equipment (defined as products,
systems and solutions). electricity generation (measured in twh) relates to plant operating hours
and drives the demand for service and maintenance. more operating hours (full-load hours or
equivalent full-load hours) typically drive service demand, e.g., demand for replacements of gas
turbine blades. primary energy supply and final energy consumption are measured in million
tonnesofoilequivalent(“mtoe”),with1mtoebeingequivalentto11.63twh.
as the generation mix evolves and renewables gain a larger share of total electricity output, we
see opportunities for conventional generation technology to continue to act as a primary source
ofpowergeneration(thoughwithadecreasinglevelofinstalledcapacity)aswellascontributing
to grid stability by acting as a back-up for intermittent renewable sources. furthermore,
conventional power generation plays a vital role in the direct supply of thermal energy (i.e.,
heat) in district heating networks and for industrial processes in chps. we expect that
conventional generation technology will continue to play an important role in the global
electricity system, ensuring security of supply over the next decades, due to economic limitations
ofstoragetechnologiestostoreenergyofintermittentrenewablesoverlongertimeframes.
going forward, in the mid- to long-term, we see a transition of the energy system towards
decarbonization in which renewables will become the main source of cheap electricity and
conventionaltechnologieswill continuetobeimportanttoensuresecurityofsupply.wealsosee
integrated and intelligent networks that are able to continuously manage load shift. sector
coupling will be required for deep decarbonization and zero-emission energy technologies such
as hydrogen will become important to decarbonize other sectors, such as mobility, industry and
residential,andthereforetoachieveclimateprotectiongoals.

11.1.3.2.1 demandgrowthforenergyandelectricity
primary energy demand and final energy consumption are expected to grow in the medium- to
long-term, despite ongoing increases in energy efficiency. under the iea’s stated policies
scenario, global energy demand is expected to increase by around 1% per year (on average) (or
roughly a quarter in the aggregate) until 2040. according to the iea’s weo 2019, under the
sustainable development scenario, 33% of global energy demand could come from renewables
in 2040 (compared to 9.7% in 2018), thanks to additional measures to incentivize investment in
renewables-based electricity, biofuels, solar heat, geothermal heat and electrification. see also
“11.1.3.2.2decarbonization”.

according to the iea’s global energy review 2019, april 2020, global energy demand increased
by 0.9% in 2019, which represents less than half the rate of growth in 2018. this deceleration
was due mainly to slower global economic growth and the impact of milder weather on heating
and cooling. there was, however, significant variation across energy sources, with coal showing
anabsolutedeclineandrenewablesarecordincrease.
the iea’s “global energy review 2020 – the impacts of the covid-19 crisis on global energy
demand and co emissions”, april 2020 (the “iea global energy review 2020 report”), states
2
that the drastic curtailment of global economic activity and mobility during the first quarter of
2020pusheddownglobalenergydemandby3.8%relative tothefirst quarterof2019asaresult
of the covid-19 pandemic and its effects. if lockdowns last for many months (as of the time of
the report) and recoveries are slow across much of the world, annual energy demand is expected
to drop by 6% in 2020. if efforts to curb the spread of the virus and restart economies are more
successful, the decline in energy demand in 2020 could be limited to under 4%, according to the
same source. however, a rougher restart, disruption to global supply chains and a potential
second wave of infections in the second half of the year could curtail growth even further,
according to the iea. besides the covid-19 pandemic, other factors contributed to the
aforementioned declines in demand, including milder than average weather across most of the
northernhemisphere,inparticularintheunitedstates.
for the full year 2020, and subject to the already mentioned uncertainties, initial iea evaluations
indicate that oil demand could drop by 9% across 2020, and coal by 8%. gas demand could fall
much further than the 2% drop in the first quarter of 2020 (compared to the first quarter of
2019) because of reduced demand in power and industry applications. renewables demand is
expected to increase in 2020 because of low operating costs and preferential access to many
power systems, as well as driven by recent growth in capacity. the iea global energy review
2020 report has not specifically revised the iea’s long-term prospects (including those for energy
demand stated at the beginning of this sub-section), so it is unclear to what extent the steep
declinein2020andthepotentialrecoverythereaftermayaffectanyofsuchlong-termprospects.
electricity demand is structurally expected to keep increasing over the coming years. in all iea
scenarios, electricity accounts for the largest growth in final energy consumption and grows at
double the pace of final energy demand during the 2018-2040 period (source: weo 2019). the
iea sees a 60% increase in electricity demand by 2040 in the stated policies scenario (compared
to 2018), supplied by an increasingly low-carbon generation mix. electricity’s share in total final
energy consumption would rise from 19% in 2018 to 24% in 2040 under the stated policies
220
scenario. electricity would play an even larger role in the sustainable development scenario,
reaching 31% of final energy consumption. in the shorter term, electricity generation was
expected to grow by 16% between 2018 and 2025 (based on twh), driven primarily by growing
populationandtheexpandingeconomyaswellasincreasedelectrification(source:weo2019).
with respect to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, the iea states that electricity demand
quickly dropped in 2020 with confinement measures, but steadily recovered as measures were
gradually softened. as of the end of june 2020, electricity demand (weather-adjusted) was still
10% below pre-lockdown levels in most countries (including in eu countries). in the last week of
july, electricity demand was 5% below 2019 levels in eu countries except italy, while in india,
recovery seems faster (source: iea, “covid-19 impact on electricity – statistics report”,
august2020,whichincludesdatauntiltheendofjuly2020).
as previously mentioned, of the date of this prospectus, there is significant uncertainty relating
to the severity of the near-, mid- and long-term adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic on
electricity demand (and more generally, energy demand), for example in terms of negative
effects on the global economy. for information onourexpectations with regardtotheeffects of

in north america, natural gas accounted for the largest share of total electricity generation in
2018 (with approximately 33%), before coal (25%) and renewables (23%), according to the same
source. renewables have shown significant growth in the past years in north america, and are

electrification is a trend affecting large sectors of the economy. a study published by the world
economic forum and prepared in collaboration with bain & company, entitled “the future of
electricity – new technologies transforming the grid edge”, march 2017 (“world economic
forum electricity report”), states that, as generation shifts to more renewable sources,
electrification creates further environmental benefits by shifting many end-uses of electricity
(e.g., transportation and heating) away from fossil fuel sources, and in many cases electrification
increases energy efficiency. according to the same report, in oecd markets, the most promising
electrification opportunities are in those segments that are among the largest polluters:
transportation,commercial/industrialapplicationsandresidentialheating.
electricity is expected to become the central energy carrier, with increased economic activity and
the widespread use of electricity for heat, the emergence of renewable hydrogen and a global
fleet of more than one billion electric vehicles (“ev”) driving electricity demand growth (source:
irena, “how to transform energy system and reduce carbon emissions”, april 2019, available
from irena’s website). according to the same source, irena expects that by 2050, 70% of
passenger road transport, 58% of the building sector and 35% of the industry sector will be
electrified.
11.1.3.2.2 decarbonization
global efforts to reduce co emissions and deter climate change have become increasingly
2
important over the last decades. decarbonization is acting as a driver for the transformation of
the energy sector, supported by initiatives such as the paris agreement and the ipcc report, as
well as different initiatives implemented by the european commission, among many others,
which in november 2018 presented its strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern,
competitive and climate-neutral economy by 2050. an increasing number of governments are
translating zero emissions/100% clean energy goals into national strategy and into laws,
including norway, sweden, france, the united kingdom and several states within the united
states. moreover,playersintheenergysector,includingsomeofthehighestemittingu.s.power

as indicated in the un emissions gap report 2019, governments must roughly triple their efforts
(i.e., their respective ndcs must be increased) and introduce new measures on an urgent basis to
ensureglobalwarmingstayswellbelow2°c(forthe1.5°cscenario,theoriginallevelofambition
should be increased around fivefold). the iea’s global energy & co status report 2019 (march
2
2019) states that the coal use in the power sector alone emitted more than 10 gigatons (“gt”) of
222
co in 2018, making them one of the largest emitters of co . the need to reduce the gap
2 2
between emissions and climate change targets is prompting changes, including the increase in
the deployment of renewables and the reduction of fossil energy sources. however, we believe
that fossil fuels will continue to play a significant role in primary energy demand until 2050,
whileweexpectashiftfromoilandcoaltogas.
according to the iea’s “renewables 2019” report, october 2019 (overview available on iea’s
website), renewable power installed capacity was set to expand by 1,200 gw between 2019 and
2024 (representing a 50% increase in terms of net new installed capacity over such forecast
period compared with the total installed capacity in 2019), led by solar pv (697 gw increase) and
onshore wind (308 gw increase) (representing almost 60% and 25%, respectively, of the total
expected growth of renewables). on may 20, 2020, the iea published its “renewable energy
market update – outlook for 2020 and 2021” (“iea renewables 2020 update report”), which
updated in part its october 2019 “renewables 2019” report in light of the covid-19 pandemic.
accordingtothis report, renewables, while notimmune tothecovid-19crisis, aremoreresilient
thanotherfuels.globally,overalldemandforrenewablesisexpectedtoincreaseduetotheiruse
in the electricity sector, according to the iea source. even with end-use electricity demand falling
significantly becauseoflockdown measures, low operatingcosts andpriority access tothegridin
many markets allow renewables to operate at near-full capacity, enabling renewable generation
to grow. this increased production is in part due to record-level capacity additions in 2019.
however, supply chain disruptions, construction delays and macroeconomic challenges increase
the uncertainty about the total amount of renewable capacity growth in 2020 and 2021:
according to the iea, while renewable capacity additions may decline overall in 2020, the
majority of the delayed renewable projects could come online in 2021 and lead to a rebound in
capacity additions, so that in 2021 renewable capacity additions would almost reach the level of
those additions in 2019. for information on the expected development of wind capacity
additions over the next years according to wood mackenzie, see “11.5.3 market size and
development”.
according to the iea global energy review 2020 report, renewables are the only energy source
likely to experience demand growth across the remainder of 2020, regardless of the length of
lockdown or strength of recovery, with an expected increase of about 1% of renewable energy
demand compared to 2019 levels; renewable electricity generation is expected to increase by
nearly5%,accordingtothesamesource,toreachalmost30%ofelectricitysupplyglobally.
in the longer-term, under the iea’s stated policies scenario the share of renewable sources in
global electricity installed capacity is expected to rise from 35% in 2018 to 55% in 2040 (source:
weo 2019). in addition, the share of renewables in electricity generation is expected to rise to
approximately 44% by 2040 under the same iea scenario, from 26% in 2018, effectively
exchanging places with coal (25% in 2040) – even though coal and gas remain the largest and
second-largest energy source under this scenario in terms of global primary energy demand
(source: weo 2019). with respect to wind energy, cumulated installed wind capacity by 2040
under the stated policies scenario is expected to amount to 1,856 gw, or 14% of the total
electricity generationcapacitymix(source:weo2019),asharpincreasefromthe566gw(or8%)
generated by wind in 2018. under the sustainable development scenario of the iea, renewables
would account for around 80% of capacity additions in all regions until 2040, complemented
mainly by nuclear power and carbon capture technologies (source: iea, weo 2019 materials on
the iea’s website). also under the sustainable development scenario, according to the iea, the
accumulated wind fleet would be projected to reach 2,930 gw in 2040, or 19% of the total

while pursuing the decarbonization of energy systems, it is important to continue to ensure the
reliability of sustainable energy supply and, at the same time, keep energy prices affordable for
households and businesses, deliver future-proof infrastructure and empower energy users. in a
223
fossil-dominated economy, decarbonization of sectors such as the industrial, power, heating, gas
or mobility sectors was largely conducted separately. to reach the target of net zero co -

sectorssuchastransport,theindustrialsectorandheating;thisprocessiscalled“sectorcoupling”
(also referred to as “sector integration”) and is a prerequisite to widely decarbonize energy and
to achieve climate targets. sector coupling takes renewable energy from the power sector to
other sectors and can therefore act as a key lever for the decarbonization of all end-user sectors.
sector coupling is also crucial to reach a deep decarbonization of the energy sector. it allows for
a higher overall energy efficiency and supports supply and load balancing in cases where a high
shareofintermittentrenewableenergyisfedintothegrid.
sector coupling based on electrolysis, for example, can play an important role in the
decarbonization of energy-intensive industries that are difficult to electrify, as stated in the
sector coupling study of the european parliament (november 2018). these industries could use
“green” hydrogen (generated from renewable sources) as an energy source and to produce
chemical feedstock, such as hydrocarbons, alcohols and ammonia. as stated in a report published
by the iea on june 2019 entitled “the future of hydrogen – seizing today’s opportunities”
(revisedversionofjuly2019)(“ieahydrogenreport”),hydrogenisaversatileenergycarrierthat
can be produced, stored, transported and used in many different ways. therefore, hydrogen
offers possibilities to decarbonize a range of sectors – including long-haul transport, chemicals,
and iron and steel – all of which are facing difficulties so far to meaningfully reduce emissions. it
can also help improve air quality and strengthen energy security. hydrogen, its derivatives and
hydrogen-based fuels can be used to transport energy from renewables over long distances –
from regions with abundant solar and wind resources, such as australia or latin america, to
energy-hungrycitiesandregionsthousandsofkilometersaway(source:ieahydrogenreport).
according to the iea, in 2019, hydrogen maintained its unprecedented recent momentum,
awakening keen interest among policy makers. it was a record year for electrolysis capacity
becoming operational, with over 25 mw of electrolyzer capacity coming online and larger
projects announced (in the order of hundreds of mws that should begin operating in the early
2020s). in addition, the fuel cell electric vehicle market almost doubled owing to outstanding
expansioninchina,japanandkorea(source:ieawebsite, topichydrogen(trackingreport,june
2020)). notable policies in france and korea, plus high-level co-ordination by japan, bear witness
to increased government interest. in addition, in june 2020, the german federal government
adopted a “national hydrogen strategy”, ultimately aiming at developing industrial-scale
hydrogen production plants with a total production capacity of 5 gw until 2030, and a further
5 gw until 2035-2040, including a total of € 9 billion in government spend until 2030. global
hydrogen demand could grow from approximately 8exajoules (“ej”) (provided byapproximately
56 million metric tons (“mt”) of gaseous hydrogen) in 2015 (which represented 1.4% of the
global primary energy demand in 2015) to approximately 78 ej (provided by approximately 546
mt of gaseous hydrogen) in 2050 (which would represent 12.0% of the projected global primary
energy demand for 2050) (source for global hydrogen demand: hydrogen council, “hydrogen
scalingup–asustainablepathwayfortheglobalenergytransition”,november2017(“hydrogen
council report”), including ej figures and conversion metrics to mt; sources for global primary
energy demand in 2015 and projection for 2050: mckinsey, “global energy perspective:
reference case 2018”, december 2017, and “global energy perspective 2019: reference case”,
january 2019, respectively). also irena sees a significant potential for “green” hydrogen. in its
“global renewables outlook, edition 2020” study, irena expects global “green” hydrogen
production to increase from around 1.2 mt (correlating with 0.16 ej) in 2015-2018 to
approximately 9 mt (correlating with 1.1 ej) in 2030 and 25 mt (correlating with 3 ej) in 2050, in
both cases under irena’s planned energy scenario (which is irena’s primary reference case for
this study, based on governments’ current energy plans and other planned targets and policies
(as of 2019), including ndcs under the paris agreement or any more recent climate and energy
targets or plans for a given country). under irena’s transforming energy scenario (which
describes an ambitious, yet realistic, energy transformation pathway based largely on renewable
energy sources and steadily improved energy efficiency, on the path to keep the rise in global
224
temperatures to well below 2°c and towards 1.5°c during this century, according to irena’s
definition), annual “green” hydrogen production would increase to approximately 25 mt
(correlatingwith3ej)in2030and160mt(correlatingwith19ej)by2050.
market experts also expect significant growth for “green” hydrogen in the shorter-term, from a
cumulative installed electrolyzer capacity of around 250 mw over the 2000-2019 period to a
2020-2025 project backlog of 3.2 gw, which represents a capacity of more than twelve times the
size of today’s total installed hydrogen electrolyzer capacity (source: wood mackenzie, “the
futureofgreenhydrogen”,overviewavailableonwoodmackenzie’swebsite).
however, the projections relating to the production and use of hydrogen are subject to a very
high level of uncertainty. according to the iea hydrogen report, widespread use of hydrogen in
global energy transitions faces several challenges, including a too high cost to produce hydrogen
from low-carbon energy, whereby according to the iea, such cost could be considerably reduced,
as explained above in the description of the market drivers. furthermore, the development of
hydrogeninfrastructureisslowandtherebylimitingwidespreadadoption,accordingtothesame
source. in its report, the iea includes several key recommendations to help governments and
companies to scale up hydrogen to fulfil its long-term potential, including stimulating
commercial demand for clean hydrogen, supporting r&d to bring down costs, eliminating
unnecessary regulatory barriers and harmonizing standards, among others. therefore, we expect
that the pace of regulations supporting and promoting hydrogen and other renewable-based
energy forms, such as synthetic fuels, the extent to which industry players and their customers
commit voluntarily todecarbonizationandtheeconomic attractiveness of“green”hydrogenwill
play an important role in the market development of green hydrogen and related technology
and equipment, such as hydrogen electrolyzers. an iea analysis finds that the cost of producing
hydrogen from renewable electricity could fall 30% by 2030 as a result of declining costs of
renewables and the scaling up of hydrogen system production (source: iea hydrogen report). in
addition, the same source states that fuel cells, refueling equipment and electrolyzers can all
benefit from mass manufacturing. moreover, the potential increase in prices for co certificates,
2
as discussed for example in germany in connection with the government’s climate concept
(including, among others, a national co emissions trade for transport and buildings, with an
2
upper and lower price limit) may result in more attractive economic considerations for green
hydrogen.
siemens energy is active in the field of hydrogen with its offering of electrolyzer systems based
on the proton-exchange-membrane (“pem”) electrolysis technology (for more information, see
“12.3.4.1 new energy business”). key competitors include nel asa, oslo (norway), hydrogenics
corporation,mississauga/ontario (canada),mcphyenergys.a.,lamottefanjas(france),anditm
power plc, south yorkshire (united kingdom), which are mostly active in europe and north
america. in addition, several chinese players are present in china, but a growing tendency to
expandoutsideofchina.
in addition, to achieve decarbonization, including the climate goals of the paris agreement, the
implementation of an international co pricing mechanism could play an important role.
2
governments around the world have already collected more than usd 45 billion generated by
co pricing systems in 2018 (source: world bank group, “state and trends of carbon pricing
2
2020”), which are being invested in low-carbon infrastructure or used to support technological
advances. also, the private sector is increasingly integrating climate risks and opportunities into
their long-term strategies and corporate governance. the same world bank source reports that
about 1,600 companies have disclosed that they have either implemented an internal co pricing

systemorareplanningtodosointhenexttwoyears.
11.1.3.2.3 decentralization
the power system is increasingly influenced by distributed energy generation, primarily from the
strong growth in wind turbines and solar pv installations. distributed energy systems comprise
not just decentral generation, but also local energy storage as well as demand response. many
consumers,bothhouseholdsandbusinesses,havealsobecomeproducersofelectricitywhichthey
225
either consume at the source or feed into the electricity grid. these so-called “prosumers” differ
from classical consumers in their role within the energy system, which has implications for their
expectations towards energy suppliers, their grid usage patterns, and their potential future role
inbalancingsupplyanddemandofelectricity.
while we expect centralized generation units to continue to play an important role in the
foreseeablefuture,weexpectthetrendtowardsdecentralizationtopersist.
decentralization makes customers active elements of the system, but requires significant
coordinationandposesnewchallengestotheelectricitygridandthedistributionnetworkwhere
thebroadmajorityofdecentralizedsystemsareconnected.duetomoreintensivegridusageand
increased feed-in from renewables installations at distribution system operator level, we believe
that grid balancing is becoming more challenging and complex, with increasing demand for grid
stabilization and with distribution system operators playing a more important role. in addition,
the changes will require significant investments and smarter grid infrastructure in the future, as
new and more advance transmission and distribution solutions are required to address the
challenges of a more complex grid. in addition, a study prepared by tennet and gasunie states
that the integration of electricity and gas grids will create new transport and storage
opportunities, and highlights the importance of a close collaboration between both
infrastructures to guarantee the reliability of the energy system amidst increasing fluctuations in
solar and wind energy production (source: tennet, “system integration important for meeting
climatetargets”,february15,2019).
withrespecttostorage,projectionsestimatethatdemandforenergystorage,excludingpumped
hydro, will increase from 400 mwh globally in 2015 to nearly 50 gw hour (“gwh”) in 2025, and
that lithium ion batteries (which are expected to make up most of the market) are likely to
become more economical as significant quantities are developed and deployed for use in electric
vehicles, a market where the demand for these batteries could reach 293 gwh by 2025 (source:
world economic forum electricity report). the same source states that, with current projections,
utility-scale storage could be a viable alternative to peaker plants (i.e., such power plants that
generally run only when there is a high demand (peak demand) for electricity) by 2023. as
battery costs decline, the cost of storage could reach parity with grid power soon – an inflection
point after which grid operators will be able to offer the flexibility of peaker plants by tapping
thestoredoutputofrenewables.
in addition, demand response creates flexibility by providing price signals (for example, lower
prices at off-peak times) and volume signals – coupled sometimes with financial incentives – to
adjust the level of demand and generation resources (consumption, distributed generation and
storage) at strategic times of the day and is, as such, a critical resource for a cost-effective
transition to a low-carbon electricity system (source: world economic forum electricity report).
energy policies around the world increasingly acknowledge the importance of demand response
and are beginning to solve the challenges that hinder its full uptake. as more distributed energy
resources come online, demand response programs may become even more flexible. many of
these programs have targeted commercial and industrial customers. however, new smarter
devices, such as precooling air conditioners or smart refrigerators that can respond to automated
price signals, as well as the progress of digitalization that is enhancing the technical capabilities
of aggregation, are helping make demand response programs easier even for residential
customers.
according to bnef, batteries, peakers and dynamic demand shall help wind and solar to reach
more than 80% penetration in some markets by 2050: around 359 gw of batteries are expected
tobeaddedtothepowersystem by2050tohelpshift excess generationtotimeswhenthewind
is not blowing and sun is not shining. demand-side flexibility also helps better integrate variable
renewable energy. this includes dynamic ev charging, where vehicles are plugged in when idle,
drawing a charge determined by time-of-use tariffs and demand response (source: bnef, “new
energyoutlook2019”,executivesummary).

benefits of digitalization in the energy markets include making make resource consumption
more efficient, assisting in addressing challenges related to power generation (such as avoiding
power outages in certain developing countries or helping to balance system reserves) and
reducing costs in the energy systems, e.g., by reducing operations and maintenance costs,
reducing unplanned outages and downtime, and extending the operational lifetime of assets
(source:iea,“digitalisationandenergytechnologyreport”,november2017).
the low oil price levels during the last five years have prompted the oil & gas industry to find
innovative ways, including digital solutions, to reduce capital and operating costs. for example,
in the upstream business, digital solutions enable remote, and increasingly autonomous,
operations which not only reduce the number of personnel offshore, but also the required
accommodationfacilitiesontheplatform.
227
we also expect digital technologies to transform power generation from the very earliest stages
of the investment life cycle, starting with the design and erection of generation facilities, as well
as with oil & gas and process industries’ applications. in addition, digital tools can enhance the
performance and profitability of power plants or wind power plants, allowing them to respond
optimally to changing conditions on the grid and in the overall power market based on the
interoperability ofdifferentassetsstartingfromsingleturbinesuptoconnectedhybridsolutions.
besides predictive or condition-based maintenance, digital tools can track and maintain historical
performance baselines for individual assets as well as the whole plant, comparing it to real time
performance monitored on a continuous basis. any variance from “expected behavior” derived
from these baselines or expected operation will trigger an event to allow mitigating actions to
follow if required. software that uses a machine’s full physical capabilities can adjust operating
parameters in real time to maximize efficiency and minimize cost. in turn, as the plant operates

the growing amount of distributed generators and storages in the electricity system presents
operational challenges for grid operators. they may cause rapid voltage fluctuation, create
bi-directional flows, or adversely affect transformer and other grid asset lifetimes. software can
help to automatically monitor and manage these distributed assets. as stated in the world
economic forum electricity report, digital technologies increasingly allow devices across the grid
to communicate and provide data useful for grid management and operation. sensors, network
remote control and automation systems as well as digital platforms that focus on optimization
and aggregation, allow for real-time operation of the network and its connected resources and
collect network data to improve situational awareness and utility services. data hubs allow the
analysis of sensor data from substations, feeders and connected devices in order to identify grid

transmission provides the backbone of any electricity infrastructure. historically, this
infrastructure was designed to transmit power across large distances at high voltages using
alternating current (“ac”) technology and to distribute the electricity at lower currents (medium
or low voltages) to the end-user. the rapid proliferation of renewables (which need to be
integrated into the grid) and the trend towards decarbonization, together with the arrival of
prosumersandtheliberalization ofelectricity markets,requiremorecomplexsolutions,including
the integration of direct current (“dc”) infrastructure into existing ac infrastructure. to
maintain availability of these complex grids and to optimize grid usage, higher levels of
digitalization are required, as well as new technologies and more environmentally-friendly
products to contribute to decarbonization, all of which will open new business opportunities. in
addition, the increasing complexity of grids is resulting in significant upgrade requirements for
the related infrastructure, which is also a driver for our addressed transmission market (as
definedandassessedbyus;see“11.2.1.2marketdefinitionsandmethodology”).wealsobelieve
that the addressed transmission market will benefit from general megatrends such as
urbanization and electrification, which are expected to increase electricity demand (in particular
as developing countries are investing to achieve complete electrification coverage for their
populations).

note: various countries have slightly different definitions of voltage levels; the definitions may also vary among market
participants.
transmission refers to the transportation of electricity over ultra- and extra-high voltage lines (in
some countries also high voltage lines), from central power generation units, such as power
plants or large renewable plants, to local distribution networks, as well as industrial companies
whoaredirectlyconnectedtothetransmissionnetwork.

as transmission lines, power cables, ac substations, transformers, interconnector and ac/dc
converter stations. the main task of the tsos is to ensure the transport of electricity and to
secure the system’s stability and availability. transmission also involves the transportation of
electricity between different jurisdictions, such as states or countries. for example, in north
america, this role is typically fulfilled by regional transmission organizations (“rtos”) and
independentsystemoperators(“isos”).
low, medium and high voltage layers of the grid are operated and maintained by the respective
dso. dsos usually distribute electricity to customers in a particular municipality or geographic
area and may also supply electricity to other dsos. dsos own and operate distribution assets
such as distribution stations, transformers, switchgear, distribution cables as well as overhead
lines, masts, poles and switches, and use telecommunication lines to control the distribution grid
to support system operation, smart metering and smart grid systems. in somecountries, dsos are
furtherresponsibleformeteringoperations.
the main task of the dsos is the operation of the distribution grid, which allows distribution of
power from tsos/dsos or small and medium-sized power producers to customers, including the
integration of distributed (renewable) energy sources into the system and the management of
electricitydemand.
originally, the transmission and distribution systems were built to transport and distribute
electricity produced mostly in centralized generating units with transformation from the highest
voltage layer through the different layers to the customer in the low voltage layer
(unidirectional). however, due to the steady growth of distributed/decentralized energy sources
in recent years, particularly for renewables, power producers are now not only connected to the
highest voltage layer, but also to the lower voltage layers up to 230 kv in several countries. as a
result, the power flow in the grid has become in some cases bidirectional and, therefore, more
complex (see “11.1.3.2.3 decentralization”), resulting in significant upgraderequirements for the
relatedinfrastructure.

11.2.1.2 marketdefinitionsandmethodology
we assess our “addressed transmission market” based on the business mandate of our
transmission division. the business mandate is defined by the market potential we assess for our
transmission business (see “12.3.1 transmission division”). conversely, segments and categories
that are currently not part of our business have been left aside for purposes of defining our
addressed transmission market. our addressed transmission market is the main market for us,
sinceitismostrelevanttousintermsofattractiveness,growthandmarketsharedevelopment.

note: the bars in the chart above are intended only to provide an overview of the methodology regarding our addressed
transmission market and the size of the bars does not represent precise values nor precise relative values among the
differentmarketsandcategoriesshown.
the addressed transmission market is somewhat broader than the market which is currently
directly accessible to our transmission business. the addressed transmission market includes, for
example, various regional markets which we cannot serve or participate in due to legal
restrictions (such as export restrictions) or due to self-imposed restrictions of the siemens energy
organization with respect to individual countries or customers, or due to missing local

are therefore not part of our current portfolio) as the “unaddressed transmission market”. the
unaddressed transmission market includes categories such as overhead lines (including towers),
high-voltage underground cables (>60 kv to <230 kv), extra-high voltage underground cables
(>230kv)andsubmarinecables(bothhighandextra-highvoltage).
we refer to the sum of our addressed transmission market and the unaddressed transmission
market as the “entire transmission market”. in addition, there are grid investments, internal
activities and internal spending of transmission market participants, such as in-house services,
e.g., in-house engineering, integration and maintenance services, which are added to the entire
transmission market to assess the “entire investment” for the transmission market. other market
participants or market research companies may use different market definitions and therefore
similarly termed markets or market segments assessed by third parties may not be comparable to
ourownmarketassessment.
within our addressed transmission market, we differentiate between the following market
segmentsbybusinesstype,namely:
(cid:129) transmission products and systems, comprising air-insulated switchgear, gas-insulated
switchgear (including both conventional (sf ) and environmentally-friendly (sf -free)
6 6
switchgear), power transformers, distribution transformers, bushings, instrument transformers
and coil products as well as other transformers (such as reactors, phase-shifting transformers

(cid:129) transmission services, such as field and maintenance, repair and emergency services,
modernization and retrofit services, digital services, training and support as well as operation
and long-term programs. in our market assessment, we include all services for the total
installed fleet of transmission assets (whether the fleet relates to our own products and
solutions or those of competitors, and regardless of whether we or another oem provides the
services).

to assess our addressed transmission market, we use our own market analysis, which includes
both a top-down assessment, which considers certain macroeconomic indicators relevant to our
marketsbasedonavarietyofthird-partysources,andabottom-upanalysisoftheglobalpipeline
for all projects relating to the abovementioned product, solutions and service categories
(regardless of whether a project is awarded or expected to be awarded to siemens energy or
not).examplesofsuchthird-partysourcesflowingintoourtop-downanalysisarethereportsand
databases compiled by global data plc, london (united kingdom), ihs markit’s global insight
database, in particular for the analysis of economical and country-related risks, the reports
published by global transmission, based in new delhi (india) (such as the “global transmission
investment report”), and reports and further data from the iea, among others. in addition, we
use our understanding of the industry, customer investment plans and our own database of the
project pipeline (which we compile using, among others, tender information, press releases and
other documents published by competitors, industry publications and our own market
intelligence).
the size assessment for each of the different market segments of our addressed transmission
market (in terms of value) is based, with respect to the project business, on projects awarded
with respect to such market segment (i.e., overall order intake) or, for future periods, on the
expected project awards. this means that the complete value of each new order is allocated to
theperiodinwhichtheorderisawarded.intheprojectbusiness,duetolongexecutionduration,
revenuesmaylagafewyearsbehind(typicallythreetofiveyears)withrespecttothetimeofthe
order award. the product business is another important sales channel. through this channel,
individual products are sold separately from a project, directly to a customer or end-user, either
because the customer itself separates such product scope from the project, or due to demand
relating to product refurbishment or replacement requirements. in such cases, the value is
allocated only to the transmission products and systems market segment of our addressed
transmission market for assessment purposes. the allocation of order intake/order award values
to a certain country (and therefore, to a certain region, as mentioned above) depends, for the
most part, on the country in which the final customer is located and in which the installation
takesplace.
in addition, we apply a principle of market value consolidation to eliminate double counting.
certain products sold are later integrated by our other business divisions within siemens energy
into a system or solution, who then install such products for a customer. without the
232
consolidation principle, order intake for such products would be taken into account more than
once, with each new order relating to them. similarly, the consolidation principle allows to
eliminate double-counting in cases of intra-group sales of products, systems, etc. that are then
soldtoathirdparty.
market sizes (including estimated future market sizes) are calculated in euro based on the
end-customer price. foreign currency amounts for the fiscal year 2019 (and any other historic
periods) are converted into € using exchange rates for the respective fiscal year. projection
figures relating to the current fiscal year and any future fiscal years (e.g., for the fiscal year2025,
as shown in the table further below) are calculated taking into consideration (i) a projected
foreign exchange rate (in the case of the figures shown in this chapter, the foreign exchange
rates for march 3, 2020 have been used as projected rates for the respective foreign currencies
overthecompleteforecastperiod)and(ii)projectedgeneralcapitalcosteffects.
we have calculated market positions and other statements relating to our competitive
environment taking into account order intake. it must be noted that for transmission solutions
and transmission services, the inherent volatility relating to large awarded projects in a given
year may result in changes in the market position among the major players from one year to
another.

for the coming years until 2025, based on our own assessment, we expect slight growth in our
addressed transmission market, with strong absolute contribution from mature regions. while
we see china still as the largest single country in terms of absolute value, we expect a slowdown
over the 2019-2025periodin thatcountry, resulting in amoderategrowth in asiaoverall. in asia
excluding china and the middle east we expect the highest growth rates. for north america we
expect a high growth rate coming from the integration of renewables, while for europe and
africaweexpectaflatdevelopment.
all figures shown in this section have been assessed prior to a consideration of the potential
impact of the covid-19 pandemic. since electricity grids are part of countries’ critical
233
infrastructure, we currently expect that the covid-19 pandemic will have a moderate impact on
our addressed transmission market. we expect some volatility in drivers such as the financial
strength of customers and their willingness to invest as well as regarding project timing
(including potential shifts of orders for projects delayed due to the effects of the pandemic to
subsequent fiscal years). we currently assume a peak near-term negative impact on our
addressedtransmissionmarketinasingle-digitpercentagelevelfor2020-2021.certaincountries
(e.g., in latin america and/or the middle east) that are heavily dependent on income from oil &
gas and related commodities may curtail investments in capital-intensive transmission projects
during periods of low oil & gas prices. in the longer-term, in particular with respect to the 2025
figures, we currently expect the covid-19 pandemic would have a significantly less profound
impact on market developments. however, uncertainties remain at this time, for example as
regards the timing and magnitude of the potential impact, so that actual market developments
mayturnouttobedifferentfromthosementionedinthissection.
growth in renewables, industrial activity and infrastructure is contributing to growth in the
entire transmission market as well as in our addressed transmission market. in addition, global
and regional interconnections are generating further opportunities. we also believe that the
addressed transmission market will benefit from megatrends such as urbanization (see
“11.1.3.1 global megatrends”) and electrification (see “11.1.3.2.1 demand growth for energy
and electricity”), which are expected to increase electricity demand, as well as from renewable
energy integration, new technologies, digitalization and more environmentally-friendly products
thatareincreasinglyinfocustooptimizetheusageofgridsandtoreducethecarbonfootprint.
we expect that growth in our addressed transmission market over the next few years shall be
driven,inparticular,bythefollowingfactorsandtrends:
loadgrowth
expanding economies and rising demand for power, mainly in developing countries, are fueling
the demand for power transmission networks. these countries are also investing in order to
achieve complete electrification coverage for their populations. in addition, growth in
transmission technologies is directly related to large-scale sector coupling, e.g., the increase of
green hydrogen production in countries with cheap electricity from renewable sources. thus,
sector coupling, although not directly driving electricity consumption, is contributing to drive
loadgrowth.
in particular, we believe that asian electricity markets (except for china)will significantly expand
inthecomingyears,whichwouldrequiremoreinvestmentintheirrespectivepowertransmission
sectors. providing access to electricity to growing populations and meeting increase in loads are
among the key investment drivers for the growth of the electricity infrastructure in africa and
the middle east. in addition, many latin american countries are supporting each other in
meeting the rising power demand (e.g., with the creation of common inter-country
infrastructure to share energy demand and supply) and in improving the domestic electrification
ratethroughpowerexchange.
connectingrenewableenergy
in light of rising concerns regarding environmental impact, many countries around the globe are
investing in renewables to generate power. establishing a reliable connection for the power
produced in these clean energy projects to the grids is one of the key drivers for investment in
powertransmission.
in europe, the majority of the transmission projects are currently focused on connecting onshore
and offshore wind power projects to the grid. offshore wind power plants are also gaining
momentum in the united states and china. furthermore, both the united states and canada are
developing several interconnections to transfer low-cost hydro power from canada into the
united states. in latin america, the focus is currently on developing large-scale hydropower
projects.
234
in addition, backed by the prospects of selling electricity to europe, north african countries have
developed far-reaching plans to utilize africa’s high renewable energy potential and invest in
associated transmission infrastructure (source: global transmission report website, release dated
july7,2017,“africa’stransmissionsector:privateinvestmentsvitaltodrivegrowth”).
the high integration of renewables is also leading to the adoption of new technologies due to
increased complexities, not only for transmitting power, owing to their intermittent power
generation, but also for energy storage. at times, there is a lack of reliable transmission of real-
time data to deal with the issue of intermittent power generation characteristics of renewable
energyprojects,sometimesalsoduetotheirremotelocation.energystoragetechnologiesenable
intermittent renewables to be successfully integrated into the grid. they also increase the
efficiency of existing power generation and transmission facilities and improve the quality of
electricity supply. with substantial renewable energy mandates in place, several european
countries, theunitedstates andchinaarecurrentlyheavilyinvestingingrid-scale energystorage
projects.
technologyimprovements
newtechnologiesarebeingdeployedtointegraterenewablesandtoexpandandmodernizethe
existing transmission grid. besides high voltage ac (“hvac”), hvdc technologies are currently
the preferred option for the integration of large onshore and offshore renewable energy
resources, mainly in the united states and europe. for example, the ieee states that a hvdc grid
would serve as the basic transmission technology for the envisioned european “supergrid”, a key
component in securing a stable, cost-effective and reliable energy supply (source: ieee, “hvdc
grids for the european transmission system: accelerating the large-scale integration of
renewables – an ieee european public policy initiative position statement”, adopted on
september1,2017).
along with hvac and hvdc overhead lines, countries like india, china and brazil are also
developingultra-highvoltagegridsandextra-highvoltagegrids.
the integration of renewable power plants and shut down of conventional fossil and nuclear
power plants is leading to decreases of voltage and frequency stability, unbalanced load flows,
congestions, short-circuit current levels change, inefficiency and re-dispatch. to meet these new
challenges, the importance of the flexible alternating current transmission systems (facts) is
increasing. new technologies using static var compensators (which provide fast-acting reactive
power on high-voltage electricity transmission networks), also with frequency stabilizers, load
flow controllers, synchronous condensers and medium voltage dc interconnections will likely
becomeintegralpartsoffuturepowergrids.
another key trend in the transmission industry has been the increase in the use of underground
cables. while underground cables with voltage levels up to 150 kv have been an option in
congested cities and towns for some time, high-voltage cables are being deployed only in cases
wheretherehasbeenverystrongpublicoppositiontooverheadlinesandonlyforshortdistances
duetotheirhighcost.
advanced technologies are also being developed for transmission substations to improve their
efficiency and reduce their impact on the environment. utilities and other industrial players are
now becoming aware of the benefits of introducing digitalization and environmentally-friendly
productsintotheirtransmissionanddistributionnetworks.pilotsarebeingundertaken,mainlyin

many developed countries are also investing in improving their aged power infrastructure with
new and advanced technologies. these mainly include the united states and europeancountries,
wherethepowertransmissionnetworkdevelopmentbegunintheearly19thcentury.
235
we also expect that in asian countries, as well as in australia and new zealand, capital
expenditures in the coming years will also cover the replacement and refurbishment of existing
grid infrastructure (source: global transmission research, “global utility transmission investment
report2019-2028”).
11.2.3 competitiveenvironment
we believe that major competitive factors in our addressed transmission market include
portfolio coverage, price, product and solution reliability and availability, efficiency, quality,
technology (including digitalization), experience, references, environmental impact, ability to
match local requirements and standards, as well as service capabilities. long-term relationships
withcustomersresultinsupplyframecontractsandlong-termserviceagreements.
the competitor landscape in our addressed transmission market is complex. with its products,
solutionsandservices,siemensenergy’stransmissiondivisionaddressescustomersegmentsalong
the energy value chain, including customers active in power generation, those active in
transmission and distribution as well as industrial customers acting as consumers or prosumers.
we compete with other large global players, mainly with the power grids division of abb asea
brown boveri ltd., zurich (switzerland) (“abb”), 80.1% of which was acquired by hitachi tokyo
(japan) in july 2020 (with an option to acquire the remaining interest later) and which now
operates under the name hitachi abb power grids ltd. (“hitachi abb power grids”), and with
general electric international, inc., headquartered in boston/massachusetts (united states)
(“ge”), including the acquired alstom power and grid business. other competitors are active in
one or more areas of our addressed transmission market, including tbea co., ltd., changji
(china), china xd group, xian (china) (“china xd”), pinggao co. ltd., henan (china), toshiba
corporation, tokyo (japan), hyundai group co., ltd., seoul (south korea), sgb-smit gmbh,
regensburg(germany),hyosungheavyindustries,seoul(southkorea)andupcoming,expanding
multi-regional players like larsen & toubro limited, mumbai (india). there are also many small
companies which are typically specialized in particular market segments, and most of them are
focusedontheregionsinwhichtheyarebased.
during the last few years, the market showed consolidation, internal reorganizations and
cooperations among players. for example, in addition to hitachi’s acquisition of abb’s power
grids division, as mentioned above, snc-lavalin and abb announcedthe formation of the linxon
joint venture in december 2017, focusing on the execution of turnkey electrical ac substation
projects. moreover, in 2019, ge integrated its grid solutions business with its renewable energy
business.
certain portions of our addressed transmission market, for example the business for large hvdc
or grid access projects within transmission solutions, are project-driven. in these businesses for
large hvdc and grid access solutions, the top-three global players (which include siemens
energy), account for a sizeable share of the relevant market segment. by contrast, other types of
business, such as that relating to air-insulated switchgear and gas-insulated switchgear, are
characterized by a market environment including both international players and a fairly large
numberoflocalproviders.
weestimatethatwebecamethelargestplayerinouraddressedtransmissionmarketworldwide
in 2019, closely followed by hitachi abb power grids, before ge and china xd. siemens energy’s
and hitachi abb power grids’ market position in a given year is highly dependent on the
solutions and hvdc business, in particular with respect to varying volumes relating to large
projects. we also assess that we were the largest or second largest player in each of our three
mainregions(theamericas,emeaandasia,australia)in2019.
the global transmission products and systems market segment of our addressed transmission
market is fragmented, with a large number of small and medium-sized participants that mainly
cater to specific market segments and to customers which are mostly focused on a low capital
investment. however, some organized global or regional participants account for a considerable
portion of the transmission product market segment, since these types of electrical equipment
constitute critical infrastructure for power networks, which typically require a high level of
236
reliability and offer customers a lower overall total cost of ownership (i.e., a combination of
capital expenditures and operating expenses investment). according to our own assessment, we
were the second largest player in the global transmission products and systems market segment
of our addressed transmission market in 2019, behind hitachi abb power grids and before ge
and china xd. in our assessment, we have narrowed the gap to the market leader hitachi abb
power grids in this market segment, gaining 1 percentage point in market share from 2018 to
2019. also based on our own assessment, within the transmission products and systems market
segment we believe we were the global market leader for switching products (i.e., air-insulated
switchgear and gas-insulated switchgear, circuit breakers, disconnecting switches, etc.) and the
secondlargestglobalplayerfornon-switchingproducts(i.e.,powertransformersanddistribution
transformers,bushings,instrumenttransformers,coilproducts,etc.)in2019.
within the transmission solutions market segment of our addressed transmission market,
businesses such as the grid access and hvdc market segments, as mentioned above, are highly
project-driven. due to the decreasing hvdc investment in china, the state grid corporation of
china (sgcc) is selectively participating in oversea projects. in the grid access area, competition
continues to increase by market entries of new participants (e.g., shipyards, mainly acting in the
ac grid access business). moreover, in the substation and facts business areas, the three main
players – siemens energy, hitachi abb power grids and ge – play an important role. however, a
considerable portion of substation projects tends to be awarded to individual national players
which execute, on average, less than one project per year. in the market segment for
transmission solutions, weestimatethatwewerethelargestplayerworldwide in2019,followed
byhitachiabbpowergrids,geandthesgcc.
in the transmission services market segment, which is mainly a small project business for
switching products, there are several smaller local independent service providers with (in many
cases) aggressive pricing strategies, multi-brand service offerings, lean set-ups and low-cost
structures. we assess that we were the second largest player in the transmission services market
segmentworldwidein2019,afterhitachiabbpowergridsandbeforege.
in our assessment, the following factors contribute to our strong market position: (i) our
environmentally-friendly and carbon neutral portfolio elements, (ii) our digitally enabled
portfolio,(iii)ourleadinghvdctechnologies,(iv)ourcomprehensivesafetyconcepts(toprevent,
protect and mitigate grid operational issues), (v) our wide-range of grid stabilizing portfolio
elements and solutions (we estimate that we have a leading position in the field of grid stability
products, in terms of order intake for 2019, in euro, for facts and phase shifters), and (vi) the
factthatourportfoliocanactasenablerforoffshorewindgridaccess.
11.3 the addressed generation market
11.3.1 introduction;definitionsandmethodology
our generation division offers central and distributed generation products (e.g., gas turbines,
steam turbines, generatorsandengines),solutions(e.g.,largeandindustrial powerplantsaswell
as i&c and electrical solutions) and services (e.g., spare parts, field services, long-term programs,
o&m and controls, digitalization and electrical modernizations and upgrades) addressing a wide
field of market segments in the power generation industry. for more information on our
generationoffering,see“12.3.2generationdivision”.
our addressed generation market (as defined and assessed by us; see “11.3.1.2 market
definitions and methodology”) is based on fossil fuels such as gas, oil and coal. these fuels
(together with nuclear and hydro power) have been providing the backbone of electricity
generation globally for many years. proliferation of renewables such as wind and solar pv have
led to widely differing trends in different countries and regions depending on the existing
infrastructure, availability of fuel, wealth and environmental policies. while somecountries (such
as china, india or indonesia) continue to invest in coal, others have been looking for alternative
fuels. we expect this shift away from coal to continue. an increasing number of power
generation companies are switching from coal to gas (so-called “coal to gas shift”), supported by
low gas prices and increasing carbon prices, or due to regulations. we also believe that in many
237
countries and regions gas will be a transitional source of fuel providing a market for highly
efficient large gas (and steam) turbines and for small and medium-sized gas turbines for
decentralized power generation. with more availability of carbon-neutrally produced hydrogen,
we see hydrogen substitute gas as a fuel providing a market for hydrogen-enabled gas turbines
contributing to decarbonization. for example, in july 2020, the european union adopted a eu
hydrogen strategy to explore how clean hydrogen can help reduce the eu economy’s carbon
emissions and make the eu climate-neutral by 2050, and in june 2020, germany adopted a
national hydrogenstrategy. furthermore, we seecontrol anddigitalization solutions andservices
as key enablers for operational improvement, allowing power generation plants to increase
safety and uptime. in particular, digitalization is expected to be a growth field, for example with
predictivemaintenancetoreducecostsintheoperationofassets.
11.3.1.1 thepowergenerationindustry
energy in the form of electricity, heating and cooling is essential for societies and economies, as
these forms of energy are required for living and working space, operation of appliances in
commercialandmanufacturingsectors,aswellasfortheoperationofbuildingsandmobility.
the power generation industry supplies these forms of energy for final use by converting various
sourcesofenergy,namely:
(cid:129) conventionalfuels,includingfossil(e.g.,naturalgas,coalandoil)andnuclearfuels
(cid:129) renewableresources(e.g.,solar,wind,hydro,biomass,geothermalresources)
power generation may be dedicated to one single form of energy (e.g., electricity) or performed
in a combined form (e.g., co-generation of electricity and heat). power generation can also be
categorized as either dispatchable power generation (which can be switched on and off) or
intermittent power generation from renewable sources based on the availability of these
resources (such as wind or solar irradiation). different types of storage, ranging from batteries
for sub-hourly differences to “power-to-x” for longer-term balancing, are used to balance gaps
betweensupplyanddemand.
high power densities are provided from central generation (e.g., large fossil power plants or
offshore wind power plants), while distributed generation (e.g., onshore wind or decentral
power plants) enable the supply of energy at much lower densities and are, for example,
embeddedatdedicatedconsumersitesorinremoteareas.
theunitednations’ sdg7aimsto“ensureaccesstoaffordable,reliable,sustainableandmodern
energy for all”. therefore, a sound mix of different kinds of power generation technologies is
required, which needs to consider emissions, existing grid infrastructure, generation costs,
securityofsupply,subsidies,fuelavailability,regulatoryframeworkandotherregionalcriteria.
the power generation industry is facing a deep transformation, which requires solutions for
decarbonization. electricity generation is expected to grow significantly in the next years (see
“11.1.3.2.1 demand growth for energy and electricity”). in addition, the power generation
industry has started an energy transition moving from conventional power generation to
renewable sources, with a significant decrease of relevance for coal. for more information, see
“11.1.3.2energytrendsandtransformationofenergymarkets”).
11.3.1.2 marketdefinitionsandmethodology
we define our “addressed generation market” based on the business mandate of our
generation division. the business mandate is defined by the market potential we assess for our
generation business (see “12.3.2 generation division”). conversely, segments andcategories that
are currently not part of our business have been left aside for purposes of defining our
addressedgenerationmarket.bybusinesstype,ouraddressedgenerationmarketcomprises:
(cid:129) generation products, comprising (i) large gas equipment for simple-cycle power plants
(“scpps”)andccppswithagasturbineunitsizeofatleast100mw;(ii)largesteamequipment

includes mostly the service activities relating to the fleet of installed siemens energy products
in service (whether effectively serviced by the group or not), in terms of market potential, i.e.,
of the potential revenues from different service activities that may be performed after the sale
ofnewequipment;and(ii)toalesserextent,ourownserviceactivitiesprovidedforthird-party

it must be noted that the services relating to distributed generation (e.g., spare parts, field
service, long-term programs, o&m and controls, digital and electrical solutions and upgrades
relating to distributed generation assets) are not part of our addressed generation market, but
are rather part of our addressed industrial applications market, as explained under
“11.4.1.2marketdefinitionsandmethodology”.
in addition, we apply a principle of market value consolidation to eliminate double counting, as
we also do for our addressed transmission market. for more information, see “11.2.1.2 market
definitionsandmethodology”.
moreover, we also analyze our addressed generation market from a geographic perspective, by
region(americas,emeaandasia,australia).
furthermore, from a different perspective, based on the main types of generation, our
addressed generation market can be split into the following two market segments (which

fossil plants, this category also comprises applications for biomass-waste and concentrated
solarpowerplants.
(cid:129) engines,includinggasengineswith250kwto3mwforstandbyandcontinuousapplications
we assess the market size of our addressed generation market taking, in general, three
dimensions for measurement into consideration: the power capacity additions (in mw), the
number of units (e.g., the number of gas or steam turbines ordered in a given year) and in terms
of full turnkey scope value (based on order intake), expressed in euro. the value depends on the
respective scope of supply. it is assessed with the specific price of power plants’ capital
expenditureperkwforeitherproductorturnkeyscope.
in order to assess the size of our addressed generation market for new units (products and
solutions) for a given year, the time of a project award and order intake is considered. in
addition, certain historical market data for the gas and steam turbine market sub-segments are
mainly based on the reports published by mccoy power reports, richmond/virginia (united
states) (“mccoy”). further internal assessments complement the data for market categories or
dimensions regarding which no or insufficient external reports are available. for the short-term
prospects, including projected growth (two tothreeyears), we derivethemarketoutlookforour
addressed generation market from our bottom-up sales force intelligence, which tracks all
known projects in the market, while the long-term outlook uses a top-down model approach,
based to a large extent on external data from ihs markit on gross capacity additions and
assumptions on construction time. for example, to assess the market size for the fiscal year 2023,
the value is backward-calculated considering the gross capacity additions expected for the fiscal
year2025,underassumptionofatechnology-specific constructiontimeoftwoyears.wealsouse

a large extent, services from the oems that provided the equipment, and to a lesser extent from
third parties, as explained above. in both cases, the market segment relating to service is based
onrevenuestreams(or,withrespecttofutureperiods,expectedrevenuestreams),whichdepend
on the utilization of our existing own fleet and our own service business with additional new
units, taking into account also market price changes. the allocation of the revenue streams
within the service portion of our addressed generation market to a certain year follows, in
general, the expected timing of major outages as well as for backlog of long-term service
programs (“ltps”), among other factors. in general, the allocation of service market revenues is
based on an approximation of the fiscal year or years in which the revenue potential would be
paid.
for purposes of the calculation of our market position within the addressed generation market,
the service portion of such market, which as explained above is largely based on the service
activities performed on our own installed product fleet, has not been considered. instead, the
market position assessments relating to our addressed generation market are based only on the
portionofsuchmarketrelatingtonewunits.
foreign currency amounts for the fiscal year 2019 (and any other historic periods) are converted
into € using exchange rates for the respective fiscal year. projection figures relating to the
current fiscal year and any future fiscal years (e.g., for the fiscal year 2025, as shown in the table
further below) are calculated taking into consideration (i) a projected foreign exchange rate (in
the case of the figures shown in this chapter, the foreign exchange rates for march 3, 2020 have
240
been used as projected rates for the respective foreign currencies over the complete forecast
period)and(ii)projectedgeneralcapitalcosteffects.
the data for both the new unit and service market segments of our addressed generation
market is regularly updated in a periodic process with several stakeholders to identify market
changes. we also use our regularly updated market analysis to adapt the strategy of our
generationdivisionaccordingly.
11.3.2 marketsize,developmentandtrends
we estimate that our total addressed generation market amounted to approximately
€ 28.3 billion in 2019. thereof, approximately € 21.8 billion related to central generation and
approximately€6.5billiontodistributedgeneration.
all figures shown in this section have been assessed prior to a consideration of the potential
impact of the covid-19 pandemic. as a result of the pandemic, we expect volatility, in particular
inthemarketsegmentrelatingtogasturbines,inserviceutilization,customers’financialposition
and project timing (including potential shifts of orders for projects delayed due to the effects of
thepandemictosubsequentfiscal years).ingeneralterms,weassumeapeaknear-termnegative
impact on our addressed generation market of up to a low double-digit percentage. in the
longer-term, in particular with respect to the 2025 figures shown below, we currently expect the
covid-19 pandemic would have a significantly less profound impact on market developments.
we expect some volatility in drivers such as the financial strength of customers and their
willingness to invest as well as regarding project timing (including potential shifts of orders for
projects delayed due to the effects of the pandemic to subsequent fiscal years). given these
uncertainties that remain at this time, for example as regards the timing and magnitude of the
potential impact, actual market developments may turn out to be different from those
mentionedinthissection.
even though we are experiencing project delays on the new unit business and shifts of service
outages(butinbothareaswithonlyminorcancellations),wecurrentlyexpectthatsomeofthese
effects are recoverable. in particular for the high share of service business with long-term service
agreements, we continue to see reasonable utilization levels globally, though with regional
differences due to covid-19’s impact on energy demand over the next years. however, low gas
prices and a stronger shift towards renewables may support the construction of new gas power
plantsandacceleratetheretirementofcoalpowerplants.
overall, we expect that the total addressed generation market will remain largely flat over the
2019-2025period(withapproximately€27.4billionin2025),mainlyreflectingthetrendtowards
decarbonization (see “11.1.3.2.2 decarbonization”). this development is characterized by an
expected increase in electricity generation: according to the iea’s sustainable development
scenario, electricity generation could increase by 11% over a similar period (2018-2025), mainly
drivenbynaturalgasandrenewables(withanincreaseof17%and63%,respectively),whilecoal
and oil generation are expected to decrease (by 23% and 34%, respectively) during the same
period (source: weo 2019, sustainable development scenario; absolute increases in twh for the
2018-2025 period). natural gas-fired generation has tripled over the past 22 years (source: weo
2019). this also underlines the role of this business in the energy transition. gas is expected to
remain a key technology in the future, as its dispatchability provides for the required reliability
and flexibility of energy systems. at the same time, gas can play an important role as enabler for
the decarbonization of energy systems, as supported by several industry reports, including iea’s
weo 2019 and bnef’s “new energy outlook 2019” (see “11.1.1 overview”). applications such as
“coal-to-gas”, decentral hybrid solutions and the burning of green fuels (e.g., hydrogen-rich
gases)helpcustomerstosignificantlyreducetheircarbonfootprint.
however, as shown in the table below, we expect the future development during the period
until 2025 to vary among the different market segments and categories. we also see a general
trend towards distributed generation and renewables. as a result, we deem the central
generation market segment of our addressed generation market to generally shrink (with an
expected decrease of 1.4% (in terms of cagr) over the 2019-2025 period, in particular due to a
241
reduction in the business relating to large steam equipment), while the distributed generation
market segment is expected to grow at a cagr of approximately 2.0% during the 2019-2025
period.

in the medium-term (i.e., until 2025), we see the following market developments and trends for
themainmarketsegmentsandcategoriesofouraddressedgenerationmarket:
within the central generation market segment, we see investment activity for large gas
equipment and solutions in countries with high energy demand, for example in the middle east,
africa and asia, and coming from a replacement of large coal and nuclear units, for example in
north america, europe and asia (as part of the shift from coal to gas). therefore, there is still
demand for baseload applications with strong requirement on high efficiency to save fuel andto
lower emissions during operations. due to the growing integration of renewables, flexibility is
expected to become more important, for example regarding ramp-up times as well as using
green fuels, such as hydrogen. in addition, large steam equipment remains under pressure, due
to several countries stopping coal activities and as a result of morestringent andwidespread co
2
targets, which in turn are limiting financing available to coal projects. also, the utilization of
existing coal-fired generation is expected to decrease due to earlier retirement of sites. overall,
we have observed a significant decline for large gas turbines within the central generation
market segment during the past few years mainly due to the fast shift to renewables. in the
coming years, we expect global demand for large gas turbines at a level of around 70 to 80 units
per year (own assessment based on an internal analysis) (compared to approximately 200 large
gasturbinesorderedin2014,asharpdeclineofapproximately60%until2018andastabilization
in 2019 on approximately 80units asassessedbyusderivedfrom mccoydata). forthe2019-2025
period, we expect a slight decline (at a cagr of approximately -1%) in the large gas turbines
242
market segment, in euro, and a clear decline (at a cagr of approximately -9% over the 2019-
2025 period) for the market segment relating to large steam turbines for coal applications, in
euro. we also expect growth in the product segment relating to powerful jumbo frames of over
300 mw, driven by the shift from coal to gas, energy auctions for base load and gas-to-power
(i.e., projects with a power plant and integrated gas import, such as lng). with respect to i&c
and electrical systems for conventional power plants, the market in general is expected to closely
follow the development of the gas, coal and nuclear markets. we expect central generation
servicestoremainstable,supportedbylargefleets,whichdemandformodernizationsofexisting
customer assets to meet future decarbonization targets and digital solutions for further
performance optimization. furthermore, we see control and digitalization solutions and services
as key enablers for operational improvement, allowing power generation plants to increase
safety and uptime. in particular, digitalization is expected to be a growth field, for example with
predictivemaintenancetoreducecostsintheoperationofassets.
within the distributed generation market segment, we see a trend to decentralization positively
impacting the business relating to industrial gas equipment and solutions, with industrial
demand mostly coming from industrialized countries in europe and america as well as emerging
economiesinasialeadingtoastablemarketoutlookoverthe2019-2025period.inparticular,we
expect increasing demand from industrial and municipality customers for chp applications (see
“12.3.2.2.2 power plant solutions”) and hybrid solutions with storage (see
“12.3.2.2.4 decarbonized solutions”). with respect to industrial steam equipment, the market is
moderately growing, as industrial steam is also addressing “green” areas such as biomass waste,
geothermal and concentrated solar power. also process heat is still required in many industrial
applications,whichisalsosupportingdemandforindustrialsteam.asregardsengines,weexpect

11.3.3 competitiveenvironment
we believe that major competitive factors in our addressed generation market and its market
segments include portfolio coverage, price, life cycle economics, product reliability and
availability, efficiency, emissions footprint, references, the ability to match local requirements
and standards, as well as service, financing and project development capabilities. long-term
relationshipswithcustomersresultinframeworkandlong-termserviceagreements.
the competitive environment in our addressed generation market is heterogeneous and
characterizedbyevolvingroles.
(cid:129) while large gas turbines products are for the most part provided by key oems, including
siemens energy, ge, mitsubishi power, ltd., yokohama(japan) (“mhps”) andansaldoenergia,
genova (italy) (“ansaldo”), the solution scope is covered by a large number of national and
multinational epc companies, e.g., bechtel corporation, reston/virginia (united states),
marubenicorporation, tokyo(japan),iberdrolas.a.,bilbao(spain),doosanheavyindustries&
construction co., ltd., changwon (south korea), or sepco3, qindao (china). in solution
projects, therefore, depending on local conditions, capacities and risk profile, among other
factors, either oems take the lead (in cases in which they also provide a full-turnkey solution)
ortheyworkwithpartnersandsubcontractorsinconsortia.
(cid:129) for large steam products, the market is mostly served by chinese players (such as harbin
turbine co. ltd., harbin (china), dongfang turbine co., ltd., deyang city (china), and
shanghai electric group, shanghai (china), and indian players (such as bharat heavy electricals
limited,newdelhi(india)).
(cid:129) for i&c and electrical systems the competitive environment differs, with abb, emerson electric
company, ferguson/missouri (united states), and yokogawa denki k.k., tokyo (japan), being
amongourtypicalcompetitorsintheoemandepcbusiness.
(cid:129) in the area of industrial gas equipment and solutions, our main competitors are ge, solar
turbines,kawasakiheavyindustries,ltd.,kobe(japan)andmhps.
243
(cid:129) in the area of industrial steam equipment, we find also different competitors, for example
triveni turbine ltd., bangalore (india), toshiba, hangzhou steam turbines co. ltd., hangzhou
(china), and weg industries s.a., jaraguá do sul (brazil) (which acquired a controlling stake in
thebraziliantgm(industriaecomérciodeturbinasetranmissõesltda)).
(cid:129) in the engine business, the main market players are innio jenbacher gmbh & co og, jenbach
(austria), man energy solutions se (formerly man diesel & turbo), augsburg (germany), and
wärtsiläcorporation,helsinki(finland)(“wärtsilä”).
there is also a certain competition between the different types of application, for example
between gas turbines and engines. therefore, we believe that a broad portfolio enables
companies active in our addressed generation market to supply best-fitting solutions to
customers. in addition, although we define the service portion of our addressed generation
market to include mostly our siemens energy fleet, we face competition from other oems and
from third-party suppliers, for example based on former technology license agreements (e.g.,
ansaldo and its subsidiary power systems mfg., llc, jupiter/florida (united states), as well as
mhps).
weassessthatwearewell-positionedwithinouraddressedgenerationmarketinkeybusinesses.
in our assessment, we were in most cases either the largest or among the two largest players in
our main focus market categories in 2019: in the distributed generation market segment, we
estimate that we were the largest player in the field of industrial gasequipmentandsolutions in
2019, in terms of industrial gas turbine units ordered (with an estimated market share close to
30% in 2019 for industrial gas turbines, in terms of units ordered; we also estimate that we have
gained market share (approximately 4 percentage points) between the fiscal year 2018 and the
fiscal year 2019). this is mainly due to our leading role in chp (within distributed generation)
with our sgt-800 turbine, which in our own assessment offers higher efficiency in the 62 mw
variant than comparable competitor products, and our expansion in the field of hybrid solutions
for decarbonized energy systems. we also assess that we were the largest player in the field of
industrial steam equipment in 2019, in terms of order intake for industrial steam turbines,
measured in euro (with an estimated market share of approximately 30% for industrial steam
turbines in 2019, in euro; we estimate that we have been able to maintain the distance to our
competitors so far in the current fiscal year), due to our efficient products and comprehensive
portfolio and our leading position regarding applications for the growing biomass and pulp &
paper markets (based on our own assessment) and a significant share of high-volume projects. in
addition, we estimate that we were the second largest player in the field oflargegasequipment
and solutions within the central generation market segment of our addressed generation
market in 2019, in terms of large gas turbine units ordered, driven by the market launch of our
high-efficiency hl gas turbine class and our comprehensive portfolio, which allows us to act as a
“one-stop” solution provider. furthermore, we estimate that we were the leading provider of
f-class large gas turbines (a technology that has been used for gas turbines for several decades)
and the second largest provider of h/j-class large gas turbines (advanced high-efficiency gas
turbine technology) in 2019, in terms of thenumberofunits orderedfor therespective category.
given that global demand for large gas turbines is typically for a relatively limited number of
units per year, multi-unit orders may have a significant impact on market shares for large gas
turbines in a given year, potentially resulting in changesin themarketposition amongthemajor
playersfromoneyeartoanother.
we also assess that we had the second largest fleet worldwide as of the end of the fiscal year
2019, representing an estimated 25% of the total global fleet of approximately 14,000 installed
large gas turbines and large steam turbines (own assessment, based on several industry sources,
including fleet data and other market sources; our estimated share of the global fleet is
technology-based, i.e., it includes turbines using our technology, whether branded by us or by a
third party). in addition, we estimate that as of the end of the fiscal year 2019 our fleet of large
gas turbines and large steam turbines represented approximately 30% of the total fleet of such
turbines in the americas; within emea, approximately 20% of the total fleet for such turbines in
europe and approximately 30% in the middle east and africa (taken together); and within asia,
australia,wehadashareofapproximately15%oftheinstalledbaseinchinaandapproximately

25% of the installed base in the rest of the region (in each case, according to our own
assessment, based on several industry sources, including fleet data and other market sources; for
this calculation, siemens energy fleet shares include both those turbines marketed with our own
brandandlicensedunitsthatuseourtechnologybutaremarketedunderathird-partybrand).
overall, weestimatethatwewerethesecondlargestplayerinouraddressedgenerationmarket

11.4 the addressed industrial applications market
11.4.1 introduction;definitionsandmethodology
our industrial applications division addresses a wide variety of market segments along almost
the entire value chain of the oil & gas industry and many process industries such as chemicals,
synthetic fuels, air separation, fiber, marine, metals & mining. for these industries we offer a
broad portfolio of products, integrated systems and solutions, comprising rotating equipment
(mainly turbo compressors, reciprocating compressors and certain gas turbines), integrated drive-
train systems, electrification, automation and digital solutions for the on- and offshore industry,
the marine industry and the fiber industry, and water treatment solutions. we also provide
services for oil & gas and distributed generation customers, including other industries such as
food and beverages, minerals and metals, industrial parks and municipalities, among others. for
more information on our product, solutions and service offering, see “12.3.3 industrial
applicationsdivision”.
the common denominator of our addressed industrial applications market (as defined and
assessed by us; see “11.3.1.2 market definitions and methodology”) is the movement of large
volume of liquids and gases. a large part of the market comprises the upstream, midstream and
downstream portions of the oil & gas value chain. however, process industries (including the
power industry), which require fuel, oil-based raw materials or catalysts, constitute very
significant end-markets, accounting for roughly one-third of our total addressed industrial
applications market in 2019. while oil and gas will continue to contribute a significant share of
global primary energy demand in the coming decades (as indicated in the iea’s weo 2019, for
example), we expect that carbon-based fuels will increasingly be substituted by hydrogen.
primary energy consumption is expected to shift to a higher share of naturalgasfacilitated byits
lower environmental footprint and feedstock availability, partially at the expense of coal and oil.
wealsoexpectanincreasingelectrification ofprocessesinordertocomplywithincreasingneeds
to decarbonize oil & gas operations. in addition, we see digitalization as a key enabler for
operational improvement, increasing safety (e.g., with new de-manning and virtual solutions),
uptime,throughput,andhigherproductivity(e.g.,withremotemonitoringandservices).
11.4.1.1 thevaluechainoftheoil&gasindustryrelevanttoourindustrialapplicationsdivision
the oil & gas value chain can be split into (i) the upstream segment, with exploration and
production(“e&p”), i.e., onshoreandoffshore drilling, unconventionalproduction(pumpingand
compression), conventional onshore and offshore production and processing; (ii) the midstream
segment, with lng, gas and liquid pipelines and storage solutions; and (iii) the downstream
segment, with refining, marketing and retail andpetrochemicals. in addition, newbusiness fields
are emerging from oil & gas customers, such as power co-generation, energy storage, carbon
capture, utilization and storage, hydrogen economy (production, compression, liquefication and
transportation of hydrogen) and “power-to-x”. siemens energy is mainly active as an oem in
many different sections of the value chain, as explained in more detail in “11.4.1.2 market
definitionsandmethodology”.
the upstream activities of the oil & gas value chain include the exploration, development and
production of oil and gas from resources and reserves. most countries grant oil & gas
development rights to private and/or state-owned companies such as international oil companies
(“ioc”) and national oil companies (“noc”), respectively, as well as to independent e&p
companies through a process of negotiation or bidding. most agreements between oil & gas
245
companies and governments are structured as “production sharing agreements”. once the rights
to explore are acquired, a well is drilled. if the well can produce enough oil and gas to cover the
cost of completion and production, it will be put in production. due to their complexity, most
upstream projects are carried out under some type of partnership structure, for example
involvingseveraliocs,nocs,oilfieldserviceprovidersandepccompanies.
the midstream segment of the oil & gas value chain involves the transportation, storage and
distribution of oil and gas. crude oil that is produced must be transported from the well head to
arefinery. transportationis carried outthroughshipping(tankers), railroad,truck,andpipelines.
natural gas must also be transported from production sites to downstream markets and
distributors via pipelines (land or under the sea) or ships in form oflng.themidstream segment
involves many players, including iocs, nocs, independent companies, shipping companies and
epcs.
oil and gas storage plays an important role in providing flexibility and security of oil and gas
supplies. large storage tanks hold large amounts of oil, natural gas, lng and other
petrochemicals. furthermore, storage can be connected directly to large consumers with highly
volatilegasdemandsuchasgas-firedpowerplants.
thedownstreamsegmentoftheoil &gasvaluechainincludes refiningandpetrochemicals, oil&
gas marketing and retail (retail refers to the sale of gas to consumers). the refining of crude oil
produces a variety of products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and chemical feedstocks.
products are sold directly to end-users through retail locations, directly to large users (such as
utilities and commercial customers), and through wholesale networks. in the downstream
segment, iocs play a major role. increasingly, nocs are stepping into the merchant refining
business as a means of capturing additional value added from their crude production.
petrochemicals (also known as petroleum distillates) are the chemical products obtained from
petroleum by refining. some chemical compounds made from petroleum are also obtained from
other fossil fuels, such as natural gas. the two most common petrochemical classes are olefins
(including ethylene and propylene) and aromatics (including benzene, toluene and xylene
isomers). oil refineries produce olefins and aromatics by fluid catalytic cracking of petroleum
fractions. chemical plants produce olefins by steam cracking of natural gas liquids like ethane
and propane. aromatics are produced by catalytic reforming of naphtha. olefins and aromatics
are the building-blocks for a wide range of materials such as solvents, detergents, and adhesives.
olefins are the basis for polymers and oligomers used in plastics, resins, fibers, elastomers,
lubricants, and gels. many refineries and chemical plants are co-located, providing opportunities
forsupportservicesandsynergies.

our market evaluation of our addressed industrial applications market is based on our internal
evaluation of available external reports provided by industry analysts (e.g., rystad, ihs markit,
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (“opec”), the u.s. energy information
administration (“eia”), the iea, the energy industries council (“eic”), the non-commercial
foundation norwegian energy partners (“norwep”), clarksons research (clarkson plc, london
(united kingdom)), mccoy gas turbine analytics (from mccoy) and the international compressor
applications and machinery committee (“icaamc”), among others), which contain information
on expenditure development, projects, as well as an analysis of internal data available within
siemensenergyaspartofcustomerrelationshipmanagementtoolsandexpertknowledge.
our market assessment for products and solutions is based both on a bottom-up approach and a
top-down approach. the bottom-up approach is based on a database of projects which are
expected to be awarded in the market within the considered time frame, which we compile
using both external and internal sources. as part of our market evaluation process, we estimate
an addressable share for our industrial applications division in these projects (regardless of
whether theproject is expectedtobeeffectively awardedtosiemensenergyortoacompetitor).
market sizes for new equipment are based on expected order intake potential for the scope
relevanttoouraddressablesharewithintherespectiveprojects.
248
besides the bottom-up perspective, we use a top-down approach based on evaluation of
expected capital expenditures volumes using external sources such as those mentioned above in
this section. the market estimates are also verified with product line and regional experts of the
group to achieve an aligned, thorough view. for our projections relating to our addressed
industrial applications market, we also use projections relating to gdp development, oil and gas
demand, oil prices and capacity utilization, in addition to projected capital and operating
expenditures.ingeneralterms,marketsegmentsreacttooilpricefluctuationsinadifferentway:
while segments with traditionally higher break-even costs such as unconventional oil & gas and
offshore production are more sensitive to oil price drops, other market segments, especially
downstream and other process industries show less volatility to oil price drops and might even
benefit from a lower oil price due to the lower cost of the feedstock. the service business is
typicallynotimpactedbytemporaryoilpricefluctuations,oronlytoaverylimitedextent.
for market evaluations on a market segment level, we consider, in addition, specific market
drivers and indicators such as number of floaters, jack ups, floating production storage and
offloading units (“fpso”), platforms, capacity additions in lng and downstream applications,
number of frac fleets in unconventional production, the amount of so-called “christmas trees”

one of the key buying criteria on the part of customers is reliability. therefore, they appreciate
andtrust theknowledge,reputationandexperienceofoemserviceproviders,whoaregenerally
in a better position to service their own branded equipment. siemens energy is positioned as a
full-service provider for its own products and solutions, providing a holistic service offering. a
significant portion of our business is transactional and includes spare parts, field service, and
repair and overhauls. however, siemens energy also offers advanced business services such as
long-term service programs (ltps), o&m contracts, modernizations andupgrades,digital services,
and training and consulting. the fact that customers usually purchase services from the oems
that provided the equipment is also reflected in the definition and calculation of the service
portion of our addressed industrial applications market and makes it different from the market
definition and assessment of the new equipment business (as described above). the assessment
and analysis of the service portion of our addressed industrial applications market is based on
(i) the service activities relating to the fleet of installed siemens energy products in service
(whether effectively serviced by the group or not), in terms of market potential, i.e., of the
potential revenues from different service activities that may be performed after the sale of new
equipment; and (ii) to a lesser extent, our own service activities provided for third-party oem
machines, in terms of actual revenues or, for future periods, an assessment of potential future
revenues based on past experience, among other factors. in the fiscal year 2019, we had a
significant market share (in terms of the value of the service activities performed on our service-
relevant installed industrial applications fleet of roughly 79,000 units), e.g., the share for gas
turbines was approximately 70%. for more information on our industrial applications service
business, see “12.3.3.4 services”. the main data sources for the assessment of the service portion
of the addressed industrial applications market are the installed base taken from our customer
relationship tool and the feedback from product line experts and regional experts about the
estimatedcustomerspendsperequipment.externalmarketdataisusedforverificationofresults
and longer time horizons. we allocate the potential sales revenues of a given service contract to
different years over the contractual term using a model that assumes a certain age-related sales
profile.thismodelisusedbothfortransactionalbusinessandforltpandsimilarcontracts.
for purposes of the calculation of our market position within the addressed industrial
applications market, the service portion of such market, which as explained above is largely
based on the service activities performed on our own installed product fleet, has not been
considered. instead, the market position assessments relating to our addressed industrial

the following information on market environment, market developments, market volumes, and
the competitive environment represents our aggregation of diverse external and internal data
andestimates.
11.4.2 marketsize,developmentandtrends
we estimate that our addressed industrial applications market amounted to approximately
€ 25.3 billion in 2019. thereof, approximately € 7.8 billion related to products, solutions and
services for the upstream oil & gas business, approximately € 5.6 billion to products, solutions
and services for the midstream oil & gas business, approximately € 3.2 billion to products,
solutions and services for the downstream oil & gas business, and approximately € 8.7 billon to
industrial categories such as applications for the chemical industry, fiber solutions, air separation
units, applications for synthetic fuels and marine applications as well as for distributed power
generation.
all figures shown in this section relating to our addressed industrial applications market have
beenassessedpriortoaconsiderationofthepotentialimpactofthecovid-19pandemicandthe
sharp drop in oil prices in early 2020, which resulted from demand contraction combined with
simultaneous large oversupply volumes. we expect the pandemic and lower oil price level to
result in volatility for our addressed industrial applications market, in particular with respect to
customer capital expenditures and project timing mainly in the market segments of our
addressed industrial applications market relating to oil & gas. this can result in potential shifts
of orders from projects delayed to subsequent fiscal years or potential cancellations of future
customer investments/projects. we expect that operational expenditures and service utilization,
as well as capital expenditures in the market segments relating to process industries, may be less
affected.themajorresiliency factorofourservicebusinessisduetothefactthatsuchbusinessis
based on an already installed fleet and predominantly reflects necessary operating expenditures
of our customers to ensure the sustainability of their business operations. we currently assume a
lowerdouble-digitpercentagepeaknegativemarketimpactcomparedwiththeoriginalestimate
for our addressed industrial applications market for 2020-2023. in the longer-term, in particular
with respect to the 2025 figures, we currently expect that the covid-19 pandemic would have a
significantly less profound impact on market developments. we also expect that oil prices will
recover to pre-covid-19 levels in the mid-term, and will reach around usd 65-70 bbl by 2025
(source: rystad “servicedemandcube” database projections for brent oil price, retrieved in
august 2020). however, uncertainties remain at this time, for example as regards the timing and
magnitude of the potential impact, so that actual market developments may turn out to be
differentfromthosementionedinthissection.
due to a diversified business mix for siemens energy’s industrial applications division, in
particular a significantly higher share of service business compared to products and solutions, a
strongservice backlog, aswell asahighshareofbusiness relating tootherprocess industries, we
expectthattheeffectoftheabove-mentionedmarketdroponourorderintakeandrevenuewill
be smoothened to a significant degree. some of the negative impact may be recoverable;
however, the recovery effect may be offset by customers shifting service demand to later years,
e.g.,duetosetmaintenanceintervals,lowerutilizationandcostefficiency.
in 2019, we saw a continuing recovery across our addressed markets following a stabilization of
oil price levels, after an oil price crisis strongly impacted market volumes mainly during the 2016-
2017 period. in early 2020, oil prices dropped again sharply, mainly due to the strong demand
contraction caused by the covid-19 pandemic and simultaneous high oversupply volumes. as
demand for oil dropped, tensions regarding further production cuts rose between opec+
members (i.e., the informal denomination for the group consisting of opec’s 14 members and 10
non-opecnations,includingrussia,mexicoandkazakhstan,amongothers).theoilpriceconflict
250
within opec+ ended with an agreement reached on april 13, 2020 by opec+ members to cut oil
production by nearly 10 million barrels a day, the largest amount ever, in an attempt to stop
crashing oil prices. however, due to the expiration of the futures contracts, u.s. oil prices
dropped to below usd zero a few days later and have thereafter recovered, however still on a
relatively low level compared to 2019. according to the iea’s oil market report, may 2020, since
the record drop in april 2020, the outlook has improved somewhat and prices, while still far
below where they were before the start of the covid-19 crisis, have rebounded from their april
lows, mainly duetotheeasingoflockdownmeasuresandsteepproductiondeclinesinnon-opec
countries alongside the commitments made by the opec+ agreement (source: iea’s summary
statementsontheoilmarketreport,may2020,availableontheiea’swebsite).
according to our estimates, our total addressed industrial applications market is expected to
grow at a cagr of approximately 2.0% over the 2019-2025 period, to reach approximately
€ 28.4 billion in 2025, reflecting global economic growth, oil and gas demand growth and
improving oil price dynamics (according to rystad “servicedemandcube” database, retrieved in
august2020,thepriceforbrentoilisexpectedtoincreasefromanaverageofusd64/bblin2019
to around usd 65-70/bbl by 2025). we expect the positive development of these major
macroeconomic indicators to translate into robust spending growth by oil & gas companies and
other industrial players relevant for our market scope during the next years. however, as shown
in the table below, the expected future development during the period until 2025 is expected to
varyamongthedifferentmarketsegmentsandcategories.
our market growth projections are broadly in line with the view of major industry analysts such
as rystad, which estimates an upstream and midstream oil & gas capital expenditure growth in
termsofcagrof2%overthe2019-2025period(source:rystad“servicedemandcube”database,

in the medium-term market perspective, we see the following market developments for each of
themainsegmentsofouraddressedindustrialapplicationsmarket:
in the upstream offshore market segments of the oil & gas portion of our addressed industrial
applications market, we see investment activity continuing to recover across several regions,
mainly latin and north america, emea and asia, australia, with increasing numbers of floating
production systems facilitated by break-even cost adjustments (such as lower operating costs or
higher efficiency) adopted by exploration and production companies in order to run profitable
projects in light of a low oil price environment. in the subsea business, we expect increasing
usage of subsea tie-back to existing offshore infrastructures and subsea power grids to avoid
using up part of the limited space on the topside. overall, we expect growth for the upstream
offshore market segment of our addressed industrial applications market over the 2019-2025
period.
according to our market observations, activities in upstream onshore market segments are
picking up globally, both in conventional and unconventional market segments. the growth in
upstream onshore is strongly driven by gas related applications, such as gas production,
processing, and unconventional gas compression, especially in such countries and regions as
russia, north america, the middle east, china, australia and central asia. beyond that, in the
unconventional market segment, we see an increasing customer demand for gas turbine-based
electric fracturing solutions offering better asset economics and environmental footprint
compared to diesel engines. overall, we expect growth for upstream onshore markets over the
2019-2025period.
in 2019, we saw the midstream market segment of the oil & gas portion of our addressed
industrial applications market strongly benefitting from a new wave of lng project
commitments to avoid a potential supply shortfall after the fiscal year 2020, showing a historic
peak in 2019 for lng. the new wave of final investment decisions regarding lng liquefaction
projects is expected to have a more global spread, with upcoming project commitments in
mozambique,qatar,russiaandtheunitedstates.
we do not expect the midstream market segment to have similarly high volumes by 2025. this
explains the expected cagr of -4.6 when the 2019-2025 period is considered. the drop in lng
over the 2019-2025 period is expected to be partially offset by robust growth in the market
segment relating to pipelines. the growth in the market segment relating to pipelines is
leveraged by upstream growth as well as the long-term and strategic nature of many pipeline
projects. major growth regions are china (china is expected to double its pipeline infrastructure
to over 240,000 km by 2025; source: wood mackenzie, news release “china’s pipeline reform:
expect higher gas prices in the short-term”, october 9, 2020), russia and central asia, which will
benefit from chinese gas pipeline expansion plans. beyond that, we see strong market
opportunitiesinnorthamerica.
the downstream market segment of the oil & gas portion of our addressed industrial
applications market was characterized by strong project activity in previous years. we expect
short-term growth in the refining sub-segment, facilitated by investments to accommodate
amendments to the international marine organization (“imo”)‘s bunker fuel regulation and
improvingstandardsaswellasinrelatedwatersolutions.whilebytheendoftheforecastperiod
(2025), investment volumes in refining are likely to slow down (the expected 2019-2025 cagr is
0%), we expect continuous growth in the petrochemicals sub-segment, strongly linked to
expected gdp growth and increasing demand for petrochemical products, especially in emerging
economies and north america. in the petrochemicals market segment, we expect growth in
polyolefinsandolefins,forexampleinconventionalcrackerapplicationsinchina.
in industry-related market segments, including air separation, chemicals, metallurgy and utilities
(e.g., regarding fuel gas compression applications for gas turbines), fiber and marine, as well as
services for distributed generation assets, we expect growth at a cagr of 4.2% over the 2019-
2025 period. in air separation, we expect a sustained recovery of the business relating to
industrial gases, driven by global gdp growth and related industrial growth, especially in
emerging economies. the main industrial driver for industrial gases is steel, since oxygen and
252
argon are needed for steel-making from crude iron. other industries with oxygen demand are
the chemicals, petrochemicals and refining, glass and pv industries. in the air separation business
relating to gasification there is a strong demand, mainly from china and the united states,
wherepetrochemicalprojectsneedairseparationinordertoproducesyngas(e.g.,formethanol).
we expect that the chemicals markets will grow in line with gdp growth over the 2019-2025
period. we also expect that increasing usage of polyester fibers and films will drive future pta
capacity additions. overall, the market is strongly driven by increasing demand, mainly coming
from china relating to multiple applications of the chemicals market. in addition, we expect the
metallurgy markets to grow, leveraged by recovering iron and steel markets following a strong
decline during the 2014-2017 period. furthermore, we see continued growth for the fiber
industry in the packaging and tissue markets over the 2019-2025 period. moreover, we expect
chinese pulp demand to drive capital expenditures of the fiber industry in russia, the nordic
countries and south america. within the marine industry, we expect growth in the navy, ferry
and cruise areas, partially offset by a slow container vessel market. distributed generation
servicesinthemiddleeastandasia,australiaregionsareexpectedtoshowthestrongestgrowth
over the 2019-2025period, mainly because of increasing energy demand and a shift towards gas.
in europe, we expect growth to be leveraged by strong demand for decentral energy, supported
bygovernmentalincentives,resultinginincreasingmodernizationandupgradepotential.
we expect service activities to grow over the 2019-2025 period, with the highest growth rates
coming from industrial gas turbines, in particular in the field of distributed generation, mainly
driven by the expected growth of our installed base as well as growing demand for efficiency-
related modernizations and upgrades of our installed fleet. investments to improve the
performance of existing/brownfield equipment present a capital-effective alternative to the
purchase of new assets to extend equipment lifetime, enhance financial returns and lower
emissions. while we expect the solid growth in this area to continue, the current debate around
climatechangemaypresentanadditionalupside.
from a regional perspective, we estimate that all three regions will contribute to the growth of
ouraddressedindustrialapplicationsmarket,withthestrongestgrowthexpectedtooccurinthe
asia, australia region (with an expected 2019-2025 cagr of 3.7%, based on our own
assessment). emeaisexpectedtogrowatacagrof1.6%(witheuropeandafricagrowingfrom

thesameperiod(ineachcasebasedonourownassessment).
fromalong-termperspective,weseefollowingtrendsinfluencingourmarkets:
drivenbycontinuousdemandgrowthforenergy(currentlyaround850millionpeopleworldwide
have no access toelectricity, according totheiea(source: https://www.iea.org/world)), we expect
that demand for oil and gas will continue to contribute the largest share to the primary energy
mix at least until 2050. in external analyst scenarios envisaging strong growth of renewables
(e.g., iea, weo 2019), oil and gas are still expected to contribute a significant share of global
primary energy demand (53% in 2040 under the stated policies scenario, and 47% in 2040 under
the sustainable development scenario). primary energy consumption is expected to shift to a
higher share of natural gas facilitated by its lower environmental footprint and feedstock
availability,partiallyattheexpenseofcoalandoil.
global oil demand is expected to grow from 98.7 thousand barrels of oil per day (“mb/d”) in
2018 to 108.3 mb/d in 2030, with the largest growth expected to come from the transportation
sector, followed by the industrial sector (and therein, in particular from the petrochemical
sector). global gas demand is expected to grow from 65.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per
day(“mboe/d”)in2018to79.7mboe/din2030,withdemandtocomeprimarilyfromasia,ledby
china and india, as well as opec countries (source for the above information: opec, “world oil
outlook2040”,2019edition).
we expect that increasing demand levels for primary energy will translate in robust expenditure
volumes, whereby brownfield expenditure (which amounted to approximately usd 860 billion in
2019, or over 80% of total capital and operating expenditure in oil & gas exploration and
253

11.5 sgre segment: the wind energy market
11.5.1 introduction
the following description contains an overview of the wind energy market (sometimes also
termed “wind power market” or “wind power industry”), in which sgre is a leading supplier of
wind turbines and services for both onshore and offshore market segments. depending on
market requirements as well as sgre’s regional or project-specific approach, the scope of sgre’s
involvement could vary from project to project, e.g., by undertaking a full epc scope or wind
power plant development in some cases. sgre also explores opportunities in adjacent renewable
business fields which, in many cases, are also related to the wind turbine business (see
“12.4.1.5newadjacentbusinessfields”).however,theseactivitiesrepresentonlyasmallfraction
of sgre’s current business. in general, the market information for these other activities is still
verylimitedandlessreliable.thus,theyarenotdiscussedinthissection.
the global wind market has been growing in the last years, historically driven by subsidies and
other incentive mechanisms (such as feed-in tariffs), with wind now being the leading renewable
energy source driving the decarbonization of the energy sector in terms of investments and
power generation (in twh). according to bnef’s “new energy outlook 2019” (including the
underlying data set), wind power is expected to attract the largest pool of investments in the
period from 2020 to 2040 among renewables, with investments in the wind energy sector
expectedtoamount,onaverage,toapproximatelyusd178billionperyearoverthistimeperiod.
by contrast, the other main renewable energy sources, i.e., solar pv, hydro, biomass and
geothermal, are expected to account for investments averaging around usd 135 billion,
usd 25 billion, usd 4 billion and usd 1 billion per year, respectively, over the 2020-2040 period,
according to the same source (all based on 2018 usd values). technological progress has led to a
rapid decline in the levelized cost of energy (for more information, see “11.5.2.5 cost trends”),
which is widely expected to lead to a further proliferation of onshore and offshore wind power
plants (for more information on the expected market development for onshore and offshore
newequipmentandservices,see“11.5.3marketsizeanddevelopment”).

the information contained in this section is based on data from third parties as well as on
assessments and information published by sgre. several global third-party institutions, including
research and consultancy companies or industry associations, regularly publish market reports,
including market forecasts. the data from different reports may differ due to various factors,
such as publication time, level of market research coverage, varying methodologies or different
viewsregardingfuturemarketconditions,amongothers.
the main third-party sources used in this section are several reports from renowned institutions,
e.g., wood mackenzie, bnef, the global wind energy council, an international trade association
for the wind power industry (“gwec”), irena and the “renewable energy policy network for
the21stcentury”,anetworkbasedinparis(“ren21”).marketvolumesstatedinthissectionrefer
to calendar years and are based, for wind assets, on an installation approach (i.e., capacity of
wind assets are allocated to the year of installation), if not stated otherwise. market shares for
onshore and offshore (new unit market segment, as defined below) provided in this section are
based on wood mackenzie data. for all wind markets with the exception of china, wood
mackenzie considers data relating to grid-connected capacity; the calculation of market shares
for a given year in such markets is based on the grid-connection of individual turbines regardless
of the fact that the entire wind power plant may not be fully connected by the end of such year.

11.5.2 general market characteristics, trends and drivers
besides the general trends relating to the transformation of the energy markets (see
“11.1.3.2energytrendsandtransformationofenergymarkets”),thefollowing trendsspecificto
windpowerplayanimportantroleinthewindenergymarket.
11.5.2.1 trendsrelatingtomarketmechanisms
in general, there are three different types of market mechanisms currently employed to develop
wind power projects: feed-in-tariffs (“fit”), auctions and so-called “merchant projects” based on
commercial parameters, for example “corporate power purchase agreements” (“corporate
ppas”)orthesaleofpowerdirectlyintothewholesalemarket.
historically, aside from other subsidy measures, e.g., tax credits or green certificates, fit policy
has played a very important role in accelerating the investments in renewable energy globally.
long-term contracts with guaranteed tariff rates under such a mechanism provided investors
highcertaintyonthereturn.
as the renewable energy sector matures, policies need to be adapted to reflect changing market
conditions, new technical and socioeconomic challenges, and the need for integration into the
overallenergysystem.oneimportanttrendhasbeentheincreasinguseofauctionsinsteadoffit
frameworks, as policy makers seek to procure electricity based on renewables at the lowest
possibleprice,whilesimultaneouslyfulfillingothersocialoreconomicobjectives,suchaslocaljob
creation.
renewable energy auctions are becomingwidely adopted,owing mainly totheir ability toreveal
competitive prices. moreover, flexibility in their design allows them to be tailored to country-
specific conditions and objectives beyond price discovery. according to irena’s report entitled
“renewable energy auctions – status and trends beyond price”, december 2019, in 2017-2018,
some 55 countries used auctions to procure renewables-based electricity, raising the number of
countries that have held at least one auction for renewables at any time and until the end of
2018 to 106 (compared to eight countries in 2005). according to the same source, one-third of
the 55 countries had no previous experience with auctions. this often led to certain market
frictionsregardingthefirstauctions.
the transition towards affordable, reliable and sustainable energy systems is being accompanied
not only by better demand prospects for renewable installations but also by the demand for
256
greater competitiveness in the supply chain: more productive wind turbines at better prices. the
introduction of auctions as a mechanism for allocating renewable capacity or production in
electricity markets, pressure from alternative renewable sources to wind energy, and the

reduction in prices. for more information on wind turbine pricing trends for onshore and
offshore turbines, see “11.5.3.1.2 market development” and “11.5.3.2.2 market development”,
respectively.
in most of the countries, the introduction of auctions has led to a sharp decrease of tariffs. for
example, in the very first round of an onshore wind auction in india in 2017, a record low price
was set (source: bnef, “climatescope 2017 – india: country snapshot”, november 2017). a
further reduction of approximately 30% was seen in the following rounds. in the united
kingdom, the clearing prices for offshore wind projects out of the latest round of a contract for
differences (“cfd”) auction in 2019 set another low record – between gbp 39 and gbp 42 per
mw hour (“mwh”). this is around 30% lower than the clearing prices from the previous auction
held in the united kingdom in 2017. with the global transition to auctions largely completed,
the wind energy market has seen a stabilization of price levels in recent auctions in several
countries.thistrendhasbeenmaintainedsofarin2020,accordingtoourobservations.
the attractive auction prices have in return triggered discussions on a further increase of the
national target volumes for wind energy, resulting, for example, in an increase of the u.k. 2030
offshore target from 30 gw to 40 gw(as announcedbytheu.k.governmentin december2019)
and the increase of the german 2030 offshore wind capacity target from 15 gw to 20 gw (as
agreed by the german federal government, the german coastal states and the tsos in may
2019).
besides wind power-specific auctions, several countries have also introduced technology-neutral
auctions, where different technologies compete with each other directly. in such cases, we see
especiallystrongcompetitionbetweenwindenergyandpv.
with the continuous decrease of costs, renewable energy is becoming increasingly attractive, not
only from the point of view of decarbonization, but also economically. this has triggered
increasing volumes of so-called “corporate ppas”. under this model, which may take different
forms, corporates enter into agreements to source energy directly from the asset owner, often
with theparticipation ofoneormorebanksorinvestorsasfinancingpartners.thismodelisused
in particular by large corporations in north america and northern europe. according to bnef’s
article “corporate clean energy buying leapt 44% in 2019, sets new record”, january 28, 2020,
some 19.5 gw of clean energy contracts were signed by more than 100 corporations in 23
different countries in 2019. this is a significant increase of more than 40% compared to the 13.6
gwin2018,andmorethantripletheactivityseenin2017,accordingtothesamesource.
it must be noted that a combination of the different mechanisms is also possible, e.g., some
developers participate in auctions with part of the total project capacities and rely on the
wholesalemarketfortheremainingcapacities.
11.5.2.2 customertrends
according to wood mackenzie’s “2019 global wind power asset ownership report” (“gwpa
ownership report”), independent power producers, including those that are utility-affiliated
(together, “ipp”) were by far the largest group of owners of newly-built wind projects in 2018
(approximately 59% of total 2018 new build). commercial and industrial asset owners (“c&i”) as
well as institutional investors are other relevant customer groups, with a 16% and 10% share in
2018, respectively. the split differs significantly from region to region. while c&i asset owners
are predominantly seen in asia, australia, especially in china, institutional investors are mostly
locatedin theamericas andeurope.accordingtothesamesource, thetop25ownersworldwide
accounted,in theaggregate,for almost halfofglobalwindcapacityadditionsin2018.thelist of
the largest owners is dominated by chinese state-owned companies, whose activities mainly
concentratewithinchina.
257
regarding future development, according to the gwpa ownership report, although ipps are
expected to remain the largest group in terms of wind power asset ownership, their total share
in new wind projects is expected to decrease to approximately 50% in 2023. the anticipated
increase of the share of c&i asset owners by approximately 10 percentage points by 2023 is
mainly expected to result from the expected growth of china’s state-owned flagship asset
owners.
as mentioned above under “11.5.2.1 trends relating to market mechanisms”, one major
customer trend that can be observed for the last few years is the increasing volume of corporate
ppas, driven by decarbonization considerations as well as by the high competitiveness of
renewable energy. examples of customers with corporate ppas from various industries include,
among others: (i) in energy-intensive industries, norsk hydro and alcoa, (ii) in the software
industry, google and microsoft, and (iii) in the consumer goods industry, nike and procter &
gamble. many of those customers have set ambitious 100% renewable targets (see, for example,
those mentioned under “11.1.3.2 energy trends and transformation of energy markets” and
“11.1.3.2.2decarbonization”).
in addition, traditional oil & gas companies are becoming increasingly active in the renewable
energy business. in light of the global trend of decarbonization, these companies face multiple
challenges, including changing policies, growth limitations and investor preferences shifting
towards low-carbon businesses. asaresponse,oil&gascompaniestodayarenotonlypurchasing
power from renewable sources but are increasingly engaged in the development of renewable
projects. for example, shell has defined offshore wind as a key growth area and is active in the
development of multiple projects in europe and the united states. furthermore, total has set an
ambitious target aiming for 25 gw installed power generation capacity from renewable sources
by2025.
11.5.2.3 productandservicetrends
one of the major long-term product trends that can be observed in the past years is the
continuous increase of average wind turbine capacity, rotor diameter as well as hub height as a
means to decrease the cost of installation and o&m per mwh produced. for example, for
onshore wind in the united states, according to the american wind energy association
(“awea”)‘s “wind powers america annual report 2019”, april 2020 (“awea 2019 report”), the
average rated (nameplate) capacity of the newly installed wind turbines in the united states in
2019 was 2.55 mw, a 5% increase compared to 2018. the average hub height of turbines
installed in the united states in 2019 was 90 meters, up by 2.2% compared to the previous year,
according to the same source. average rotor diameters have increased at a more rapid pace than
hub heights over the long-term. the average rotor diameter of wind turbines installed in 2019
was 121 meters, an increase of 4.3% over the previous year and a 46% increase compared to
average rotor diameters deployed back in 2010 (source: awea 2019 report and, for the 2018
figure, awea’s annual market report 2018, published in 2019). furthermore, the fast
introduction of the 4mw+ platforms is expected to accelerate this trend. in europe, the average
rated capacity of offshore turbines installed in 2019 was 7.8 mw, 1 mw more than in 2018
(source: wind europe, “offshore wind in europe – key trends and statistics 2019”, february
2020). on average, turbine capacity in europe has increased by 16% every year since 2014,
according to the same source. according to wood mackenzie’s “global wind turbine technology
trends2019”,december2019,theaverageturbineratingsfromallmajorturbineoemsaresetto
double in this decade, both for the onshore and offshore market segments, partly due to
favorable cost implications for project balance of plant. in addition, according to wood
mackenzie’s “global wind turbine technology market report 2018”, geared systems are
becoming the preferred choice for onshore wind turbines, while direct drive is the preferred
choice in the offshore sector, mainly due to reliability considerations, and also since the cost of
gearboxrepairsoffshorewouldbetoohigh.
global oems usually have broad product portfolios covering diverse markets with different wind
conditions (for an explanation of different wind classes, see “12.4.1.1 overview of wind
class classification”). for example, according to wood mackenzie’s “global wind turbine
258
technology market report 2018”, wind turbine oems are working on certain design
modifications of the existing turbines to meet typhoon class certifications, and also floating
offshore turbines show potential for use in typhoon prone areas. in addition, customization is
critical to project performance and developer profitability. oems need to deliver regionally
tailored platforms harnessing modular design concepts to fill that need. achieving greater
economies ofscale viastandardcomponentsourcingandoptimizingglobalproductionstrategies
willbeessentialforoemprofitability.
in general terms, the majority of wind power plant services are provided by wind turbine
oems. while some larger customers tend to build own service capabilities and capacities, major
oems with a broad service offering, extensive know-how and a competitive supply chain can be
an efficient option for services also for those larger customers. in addition, software and digital
algorithms are migrating from the wind power plant level and gaining traction at the turbine
level as well. the evolution of digital technology has led to a proliferation of services across the
o&m value chain. the most basic digital technologies include remote monitoring and diagnostic
tools to identify turbine failures, conduct basic site and turbine performance assessment, and
generate reports. these tools are now ubiquitous, and nearly all asset managers deploy basic
digital technology in some form or another. more advanced technology incorporates data
analytics and machine learning to provide some form of early-warning predictive analytics
aroundcomponentfailure.
11.5.2.4 supplychaintrends
each wind turbine oem has its own strategy with respect to in-house manufacturing and/or
outsourcing as well as its global footprint to satisfy its demand in a cost-effective approach. an
increasing trend of outsourcing can be observed in the industry with the main goal being to
lowercostsandincreaseflexibility.
due to the high local demand in china as well as the high competitiveness of the local supply
chain,asignificant portionofglobalwindpowersupplychainislocatedinchina.inrecentyears,
the trend of supply chain migration to best-cost countries in the asia, australia region has
intensified as oems and their suppliers further exploit the cost saving and volume potential that
maybeachievedbyrelocatingproductionresourcestothesecountries,withanaimtoserveboth
domesticandexportmarkets.
in order to support local employment, local content policies for wind power development have
been introduced by several countries/regions across the globe. examples include turkey, russia
and brazil, to name a few. local content requirements are also seen in emerging offshore
markets, such as taiwan, france and the united states. for some key components, a high degree
of concentration is observed. for example, in 2019, regarding third-party blade supply, the
top-five independent blade suppliers had a combined share of 79% of this market segment, and
for gearboxes, the top-three suppliers had a combined share of 81% of the total wind turbine
gearbox market segment in the same year (source: wood mackenzie, “global wind turbine
supplychaintrends2020”,march2020).
in recent years, a clear trend towards the integration of the sustainability policy into the overall
company strategy can be observed in the wind industry. several major wind turbine oems have
set company-specific goals related to the reduction of their carbon footprint or waste out of
production. furthermore, they also have extended their environmental, social and governance
(“esg”) targets to their supply chain, including requiring strict compliance with their code of
conduct,emission/wastereductionpolicies,etc.
11.5.2.5 costtrends
traditionally, the cost development of wind power can be measured by the so-called “levelized
cost of energy” (“lcoe”), which is a standard power industry metric used to measure the total
cost of power generation averaged per mwh over a project’s lifetime. lcoe is calculated by
dividing the sum of all costs over a project’s lifetime (capital and operational expenditures) by
the sum of electrical energy produced over the project’s lifetime. it allows the comparison of
259
different technologies (e.g., wind, solar, natural gas) of unequal life spans, project size, different
capitalcost,risk,returnandcapacities.
according to the “bnef 2h 2019 lcoe update”, october 22, 2019 (“bnef lcoe update report”),
the global bnef benchmark lcoe for new-build onshore wind projects was at usd 47 in the
second half of 2019, which was 6% less than in the first half of 2019. this was mainly due to cost
reduction in equipment. in turn, offshore wind has seen the fastest cost declines in the second
half of 2019, according to the same source, down 32% compared to the second half of 2018 and
12% from compared to the first half of 2019. bnef’s latest global benchmark estimate was
usd78/mwh,asperthesamereport(asofitsdate).

according to the bnef lcoe update report, pv and onshore wind are winning the race as the
cheapest sources of new bulk generation with two-thirds of the world population living in
countrieswherepvorwindisthecheapestnewelectricitygeneration.thesamesourceestimates
that onshore wind lcoe will reach levels ranging from roughly usd 30 to usd 35/mwh in
countries such as australia, germany and the united states by the end of the current decade. in
addition, bnef anticipates a continuous decrease of offshore wind lcoe, expected to reach
approximately usd 50/mwh in the united kingdom or germany by the end of current decade
(source: bnef lcoe update report), driven mainly by the increasing capacity factor of wind
turbines, which enable lower capital expenditures per mw as well as reduced operational
expenditures. the bnef lcoe update report projects a global offshore lcoe benchmark of
usd52.3/mwhfor2029.
11.5.2.6 recenttrendsrelatedtotheintegrationofrenewables
rising shares of renewable energy continue to transform energy systems around the world. in
recent years, many countries have seen significant growth in installed capacity and generation
from sources of variable renewable energy (“vre”). according to ren21’s “renewables 2020
global status report”, june 2020 (“ren21 2019 report”), in 2019, at least eight countries
suppliedmorethan20%oftheirelectricitygenerationfromthemainvresourceswindandsolar
pv, while some countries have seen rapid annual growth of vre penetration. power systems are
adapting to rising shares of vre through a range of measures, as further stated in the ren21
2020 report: countries and sub-national entities are directing their policy efforts to ensuring the
successful integration of vre into the wider energy system and drawing on a wide variety of
flexibility resources including power market design, grid extension, forecasting and demand
response. in addition, policies for systems integration of renewables and enabling technologies
260
(such as energy storage) are focused primarily on increasing power system flexibility and control,
as well as grid resilience. in 2019, policies to advance the integration of vre related mainly to
market design, demand-side management, transmission and distribution system enhancements,
grid interconnections and support for energy storage. much of the policy development occurred
ineuropeandatstatelevelintheunitedstates,accordingtothesamesource.
energy storage can help smooth the output from renewable power facilities and minimize
curtailment. total installed capacity for pumped-storage hydropower, the largest contributor to
the global energy storage stock, stood at 158 gw at the end of the year (with 0.3 gw of new
pumped storage capacity added during the year, after a significant increase of 1.9 gw in 2018);
significant new capacity was being planned, in part to support growth in vre from solar pv and
wind power. the leading markets for battery storage (i.e., korea, china, the united states and
germany) had mixed results in 2019, while renewables-plus-storage has emerged as a major
driver of battery market growth. the energy storage industry saw significant cost improvements,
increased manufacturing capacity, large investments and ongoing r&d during 2019, with many
of these activities focused on short-duration storage applications and battery technologies
(source for all statements: ren21 2020 report, except for pumped-storage hydropower capacity
additions in 2018, which are taken from ren21’s “renewables 2019 global status report”, june
2019).
governments are increasingly incorporating the demand for integration into their overall system
design, a trend also mentioned in the ren21 2020 report. for example, in august 2019, the
indian government issued for the first time a tender for setting up 1.2 gw of renewable projects
including an energy storage system which will enable the bidders to deliver firm renewable
energy. the tender was concluded in january 2020 and competitive rates have been achieved,
which are even below the level of new thermal power generation. in addition, several plans to
launch offshore wind projects in connection with green hydrogen have been revealed recently.
although such plans are rather long-term and depend, among other things, on permits from
governments, the assignment of new wind power plant locations, the available locations for the
hydrogen facilities and the final investment decisions of the parties concerned, they show a clear
industryambitionandanefforttowardsholisticsolutionsfordecarbonization.
11.5.3 market size and development
ingeneralterms,thewindenergymarketincludesboththe“newunit”marketsegmentandthe
“service” market segment. the new unit market segment relates to new wind assets installed; it
is sometimes also referred to by some wind turbine oems as “wind turbine generator business”
or “equipment business” to differentiate from the service business. the service market segment
relates to the o&m of wind assets during the whole project lifetime. while the new unit market
segment is exclusively served by wind power oems, different types of players are active in the
servicemarketsegment,includingwindturbineoems,assetownersandisp,amongothers.
in turn, the new unit and service market segments may refer to onshore or offshore wind
projects. onshore and offshore wind projects differ significantly in some aspects, for example
withrespecttoprojectleadtimes,coststructureoro&mcharacteristics.ingeneral,onshorewind
projects have lead times that are typically lower than a year (but this may vary dependingon the
project) while offshore wind projects have a much longer planning period, due to the more
comprehensive permitting process, more complex grid connection requirements and other
factors. for example, six projects totaling 5,466 mw were awarded in the 2019 auction in the
united kingdom (cfd round 3). the expected delivery year for such projects, however, ranges
between 2023 and 2025. from a cost perspective, onshore turbine costs typically account for a
much larger portion of a project’s capital expenditures than offshore turbines, mainly due to the
much lower cost of the foundation, cables, substation or for the grid connection than for
offshore wind turbines. for example, the share of costs of a 4 mw onshore turbine within a
project’s capital expenditures in the emearc region (europe, middle east, africa, russia and the
caspian states) was estimated at approximately 80%, while the cost share of a 10 mw offshore
turbine was estimated at only approximately 50% of a project’s capital expenditures in that
region (source: wood mackenzie, “global wind turbine technology trends 2018”, december
261
2018). from a service point of view, since offshore wind projects are built further away from the
shore, appropriate logistic and transport solutions are crucial to access the turbines to carry out
serviceactivities. duetothehighereffortrequiredtoconducton-siteserviceactivitiesinoffshore
projects, condition monitoring systems have currently near 100% adoptionratein offshore wind,
which enables digital and data-based technology for preventive maintenance and an overall
improved service strategy. the economic motivation to pursue such more complex investments in
offshore is the high availability of the wind resource and lcoe decreasing with increasing
experience,moreadvancedtechnologiesandthedevelopmentofthesupplychain.
the wind energy market is a global industry. according to the ren21 2019 report, at least 103
countries had commercial wind power capacity at the end of 2018, and 33 countries had more
than1gwinoperation.
accordingtowoodmackenzie’s “globalwindpowermarketoutlookupdate/q22020”,62gw
of new capacity was added globally in 2019, representing a 23% increase compared to global
capacity additions in 2018. the growth trend is expected to continue, with nearly 77 gw of
annual wind power capacity addition expected globally from 2020 to 2029 (on average).
according to the same source, the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the yearly new
installations is mainly to be expected in the onshore new unit market segment. while the
covid-19 pandemic caused delays in 2020, most of the affected capacity merely shifted from
2020 into 2021 and 2022. however, in some countries, for example in india, the lockdown due to
the covid-19 pandemic is exacerbating ongoing structural issues, which could have a potential
negativeeffectonthisregionalwindmarket’sdevelopment.
further details are included in the following description of the new unit onshore and offshore
marketsegments.
11.5.3.1 newunitmarketsegment-onshore
11.5.3.1.1 introduction
according to the “global wind report 2019” published by the gwec in march 2020 (“gwr
2019”), the installed capacity of land-based wind turbines surpassed 600 gw by the end of 2019,
with china and the united states accounting for more than 50% of total (cumulative) installed
capacity. these two countries also accounted for 60% of capacity additions in 2019 (which
amounted globally to 54.2 gw), according to the same source. global onshore wind installations
have tripled during the past decade, as shown by the historical data included in the gwr 2019,
withthesectorreachingfurthermaturity.
onshore wind turbines cover broad market requirements: from ultra-low wind sites in china and
india to high wind sites in the nordics or brazil. the adaptation of hub height, rotor size and
turbine capacity to site-specific wind conditions, legal requirements and logistic constraints is
highly relevant for project performance and profitability. incremental improvements in turbine
technology, manufacturing and logistics have increased the size of modern onshore turbines to
up to 6 mw nameplate capacity. the scale of onshore wind projects varies significantly: from
single-digit-mw projects for small local accounts to gw-range projects for large global utility or
institutionalaccounts.
11.5.3.1.2 marketdevelopment
the onshore wind market has shown a strong overall growth trend in the last years with an
overall cagr of 3% between 2016 and 2019 in terms of new annual installations, according to
woodmackenzie’s “globalwindpowermarketoutlook update:q2 2020”,june2020.however,
the year-on-year variations are significant, mainly driven by policy changes in major countries,
especiallyinchinaandtheunitedstates.

the onshore market is expected to remain a very large market, as shown by the chart above.
currently, repowering is in general still less frequent than life extensions, since generally little of
anoldproject’s originalinfrastructure canbeusedaspartofapotentialfullrepowering,andthe
decommissioning, reconstruction and deployment of modern equipment related to repowering
(including planning and engineering costs associated with using larger and more efficient
turbines) are often not cost-effective when compared to building a completely new greenfield
project. however, when product life extensions are exhausted and as obtaining greenfield
permits in suitable locations becomes more difficult, repowering could become increasingly
attractive.
china is by far the largest single-country market for onshore wind power, accounting for
approximately 42% of the global new onshore capacity in 2019, according to wood mackenzie’s
“globalwindpowermarketoutlookupdate:q22020”.
fromaglobalperspective,thepeakexpectedfor2020-2021ismainlydrivenbytwofactors:
(cid:129) china is experiencing a crucial period of regulatory reform. the chinese government only
allows projects to receive fit if they have been approved until 2018 and get grid-connected
before the end of 2020. this policy shift, together with the improvement of curtailment in the
country,hasresultedinaninstallationboostin2019and2020.accordingtowoodmackenzie’s
“global wind power market outlook update: q2 2020”, china’s industry has recovered since
the lockdown due to the covid-19 pandemic. overall, according to the same source, chinese
wind power manufacturers are again producing at full capacity, and logistics are still
recovering, supported by provincial governments. however, some risk lingers as developers
rush to capitalize on the expiring fit subsidy in 2020, yet are exposed to foreign suppliers that
havenotyetfullyrecoveredfromcovid-19standstill.
(cid:129) in the united states, in may 2020, the u.s. administration announced a one-year extension of
the original deadline for onshore wind developerswhostarted construction ofprojects in 2016
or 2017 to complete andqualify themfor federalproductiontaxcredit (“ptc”) valueatfull or
80% value (the new deadlines are the end of 2021 or 2022 for full or 80% ptc value,
respectively) in recognition of delays from covid-19 impacts to supply chains and workforces.
they will now have five years, instead of four years, to complete construction without having
to prove continuous work on the projects after construction began. the planned stepwise
phase-out of ptc is expected to have a major impact on the u.s. market volume until 2024.
however, according to wood mackenzie’s “global wind power market outlook update: q2
2020”, on the one hand, the positive effect in terms of capacity gains relating to such deadline
extensions was balanced out in its global outlook by downgrades in countries such as canada
or mexico (which experienced certain policy shifts undermining renewables) or india, among
263
others. on the other hand, according to the same source, confidence in the united states
results, for example, form repowering, i.e., the upgrading to larger, taller and more efficient
turbines, as well as software improvements or replacement of specific components, such as
blades(partialrepowering).
inthelonger-term,thecontinuousgrowthofonshoreinstallationsinotherregionsisexpectedto
maintain the overall global installation at a stable high level. for example, emearc is forecasted
to grow at a cagr of approximately 8.5% between 2019 and 2025 (source: wood mackenzie,
“global wind power market outlook update: q2 2020”). the indian new unit onshore market
segment is expected to grow significantly to approximately 5 gw (annually) by 2025, after a low
level of installations in 2018 and 2019 (of 2.3 gw and 2.4 gw, respectively), according to the
same source. however, as previously mentioned, india has experienced structural issues in recent
times,whichresultedintheindianmarketnotmeetingexpectationsintermsofinstallations.
prices for wind turbines are usually measured in € or usd per mw. however, such prices are
highly dependent on the supply scope, regional mix and platform mix, among other factors. due
to the continuous progress in technology improvement and industrialization, onshore turbine
priceshavedroppedsignificantly inthelastdecade,andinparticularinrecentyears,especiallyin
connection with the global transition into auctions. in the last year, with the global transition to
auction systems being largely completed, the market has seen an overall stabilization of onshore
wind turbine selling prices. in some markets, a strong price rebound has been reported over the
past months, for example in china, driven in part by a short-term demand surge as well as the
priceincreaseofcomponentsandrawmaterials.
beyond 2025, we expect the global onshore market to grow until 2030 at a 2025-2030 cagr of
approximately 3%, to reach approximately 67 gw of new installations in 2030, based on wood
mackenzie data for 2025-2029 (underlying data set for the “global wind power market outlook
update: q2 2020” report) and sgre’s estimate for 2030 based on wood mackenzie’s outlook for
2029.
11.5.3.2 newunitmarketsegment–offshore
11.5.3.2.1 introduction
according to the gwr 2019, the installed (cumulated) capacity of offshore wind turbines
surpassed 29 gw by the end of 2019, with approximately 75% thereof located in north-western
europe (mostly in the united kingdom and germany, but also in belgium, denmark and the
netherlands). the total global installed capacity has doubled within the last three years (from 14
gw of installed offshore capacity at the end of 2016). with the high momentum in newoffshore
marketsliketaiwanandusa,offshorewindiswellontracktowardsglobalization.
offshore wind projects normally enjoy higher wind speed and less volatile wind conditions
compared to onshore sites. the project capacity factors are thus also higher compared to most
onshore projects. due to the high cost of the “balance of plant” portion (i.e., the portion that is
not related to the wind turbine itself, but rather to supporting components and auxiliary
systems) and high service effort in offshore projects, the advantages for using turbines with
highernameplatecapacityismoreimminent.mostoftheturbinesofferedtodayhavenameplate
capacities in therangeof6.0mw to14.0mw. theaverageproject size for offshorewindenergy
is significantly larger than those for onshore and there is a clear trend pointing to a further
increase of project sizes. for example, the newly-commissioned hornsea one offshore wind

11.5.3.2.2 marketdevelopment
in general, the offshore wind market segment is well on track to develop from a niche market
segment towards a key pillar of the future global energy mix. the chart below shows an

figures.
note: “row”means“restoftheworld”(i.e.,thecountriesotherthanchina).
in the 2016-2019 period, offshore wind volumes have been mostly concentrated in three main
countries: the united kingdom (approximately 5.0 gw of new offshore installations), germany
(approximately 4.2 gw) and china (approximately 5.1 gw). most of the projects installed in this
period were subsidized by governments through fit. it is to note that china took over the first
position of annual offshore installations in 2018 and kept it in 2019 (source for all data: wood
mackenzie,“globalwindpowermarketoutlookupdate:q12020”).
in the 2020-2025 period, according to wood mackenzie’s “global wind power market outlook
update: q2 2020” (underlying data files), despite the strong growth of emerging markets, the
offshore market segment is expected to remain largely concentrated. china is expected to
account for approximately 33% of total new offshore installations (with a total of approximately
22 gw over the 2020-2025 period). europe, led by the united kingdom (with approximately
11 gw), is expectedtoinstall atotal ofapproximately 26gwoverthesameperiod(representing
approximately39%ofglobalinstallationsintheforecastperiod).
the strong growth from 2019 to 2025 (with a 22% cagr) and beyond is well supported by a
large project pipeline as well as diverse country-specific offshore targets. according to the wood
mackenzie data, more than 80% of the forecasted capacity expected to be installed between
2019 and 2025 has already been awarded (source: article entitled “woodmac: global offshore
wind capacity to rise sevenfold by 2028”, published online in greentech media (a wood
mackenziebusiness) onfebruary13,2020).accordingtowoodmackenzie’s “globalwindpower
market outlook update: q2 2020”published in june2020,including aconsideration ofpotential
effects of, among others, thecovid-19pandemic, offshore wind capacity additions from 2020to
2025isexpectedtostandlargelyresilientoverall,amidthecovid-19pandemic.
like onshore, china’s offshore market segment is also in transition from fit to auctions.
according to a government regulation published in 2019, offshore projects approved before the
end of 2018 are eligible for the previous fit of cny 0.85/kwh, provided that the project is fully
grid-connected before the end of 2021. furthermore, the chinese central government has
announced that it will stop subsidizing offshore wind from 2022 onward, but subsidies provided
by provincial governments are likely in order to provide continuity in support for offshore wind
development.accordingly,aninstallationboostisexpectedfor2020and2021.
the ramp-up of the u.s. offshore market segment (with approximately 9 gw new installations
expected over the 2020-2025 period) is supported by the investment tax credit (“itc”) rolled out
at a federal level and the individual state commitments secured with corporate ppas. according
to wood mackenzie’s “global wind power market outlook update: q2 2020”, covid-19
compounds bureaucratic delays in the united states, but the u.s. offshore market also sees a
positive effect on its outlook due to new york’s commitment to a procurement of up to 2.5 gw
265
by 2021. the taiwanese offshore market segment (with expected new offshore installations of
approximately 5.5 gw over the 2020-2025 period) is supported by a fit scheme based on a
competitivetendermechanism.
in addition, in recent auctions in north-western europe, several subsidy-free bids have been
awarded, e.g., in connection with the hollandse kust zuid projects in the netherlands. this
reflects, on one side, the high competitiveness of the technology and, on the other side, the
requirementsofcontinuousinnovationandproductivityimprovement.
similarasforonshore,offshorewindturbinepriceshavealsoaseensignificantdropoverthelast
decade, especially in connection with the transition to auctions. however, the impact of the
individual project scope (e.g., offshore logistics), plays a significant role in the price of offshore
turbines. furthermore, the continuous technology development may enable an upgrade of the
turbine with higher nameplate capacity without a significant change of the overall turbine
designandcomponents.
beyond 2025, we expect the global offshore market to grow until 2030 at a 2025-2030 cagr of
approximately 7%, to reach approximately 28 gw of new installations in 2030, based on wood
mackenzie data for 2025-2029 (underlying data set for the “global wind power market outlook
update:q22020”report)andsgre’sestimatefor2030.
11.5.3.3 servicemarketsegment
11.5.3.3.1 introduction
to ensure that the asset owner gets the optimal performance out of the wind turbines
throughoutthelifetime,propero&mworkneedstobecarriedoutalongthefulldurationofthe
project. the service market segment relating to the wind energy market is referred to as “o&m
market” by industry research companies such as wood mackenzie and also as “o&m market
segment” hereinafter. o&m mainly includes activities such as scheduled turbine maintenance,
remote monitoring, minor and major corrective work, spare parts, upgrades as well as “balance
of plant” maintenance. it includes both scheduled tasks and ad-hoc repair work. the o&m
business supplies service providers with predictable revenue and cash streams due to the
recurring nature of the business and the long contracts commonly seen in this market segment.
for most wind turbine oems, the service (o&m) business provides higher margins compared to
thenewunitbusiness.
according to wood mackenzie’s “2019 global onshore wind operations & maintenance (o&m)
report”, december 2019, and “offshore wind operations and maintenance trends 2019”, april
2019 (when referred together, hereinafter the “2019 o&m reports”), 64% of the 2018 global
onshore o&m market segment and 71% of the 2018 european offshore o&m market segment
were served by wind turbine oems (excluding multi-vendor oems). for the past few years, some
global customers with a large installed wind turbine fleet have been adopting the strategy to
insource o&m activities. some even provide service activities to other asset owners as isps.
according to wood mackenzie, the share of in-house service for onshore is expected to increase
from 24% in 2018 to 31% in 2028. other players active in the o&m market segment are isps,
whichhadarelatively lowglobalmarketsharein2018.accordingtowoodmackenzie,theshare
of isps service for is expected to increase from 8% in 2018 to 10% in 2028 (source: 2019 o&m

the overall increasing fleet size as well as the increasing average ages of the global fleet are the
two main drivers behind the growth, according to the same sources. for onshore, the total
installed fleet is expected to surpass 900 gw by 2025, which is roughly a 50% increase compared
to 2019 (approximately 600 gw). for offshore, the projected growth rate is even higher, at more
than 200% from approximately 29 gw in 2019 to above 90 gw in 2025. with respect to ageing
fleets, in the united states, for example, the share of onshore fleet with more than ten years of
age is expected to increase from approximately 20% in 2019 to more than 40% in 2025. in
europe, the share of the total offshore fleet with more than ten years of age is expected to
increase from approximately 5% in 2019 to approximately 15% in 2025. the relatively low share
ofagedfleetineuropein2025reflectsthehighinstallationrateexpectedintheupcomingyears.
(the sources for all the information included in this paragraph are wood mackenzie’s 2019 o&m
reports.)
in the onshore o&m market segment, all regions are expected to show growth in terms of
market size. key countries in the asia, australia region, i.e., china, india or australia, are
expectedtogrowatacagrofaround10%,12%and9%,respectively,from2019to2025,while

growth rate (source: cagr calculations based on data (in usd) for the named countries taken
from wood mackenzie’s “2019 global onshore wind operations & maintenance report”). with
respect to china, the end of fit by the end of 2020 is a major o&m market driver, as oncoming
subsidy-free operations are forcing asset owners to adapt their onshore operations. in addition,
continued reliability issues from first-generation wind turbine models, in particular as the fleet
ages, is expected to drive demand for major corrective repairs. overall, o&m onshoreactivities in
chinaareexpectedtoreachapproximately€2.9billionin2025.
according to the same source, in offshore, europe is expected to remain the overall largest
regional o&m market segment in 2025, with a share of more than 60% of the global offshore
o&m market segment, but the asia, australia region is expected to grow rapidly, especially
driven by china (source: wood mackenzie, “offshore wind operations and maintenance trends

267
the global transition from fit to auctions also adds significant pressure on the price level of the
o&m business. furthermore, the service price per mw is further decreasing due to the global
shift to turbines with larger nameplate capacity. digitalization and data-driven o&m are
expected to gain further importance as a crucial response to continuous cost pressure. while
most oems offer basic digital products around diagnostics for the main turbine components,
advanced offerings around predictive maintenance and component failure forecasting are
offered by the top industry players. furthermore, the ren21 2019 report observes that major
manufacturers, including sgre, among others, are increasingly focusing on the repowering
marketsegment.
beyond 2025, we expect the global service (o&m) market to grow until 2030 at a 2025-2030
cagr of approximately 8%, to reach approximately € 35 billion in 2030, based on wood
mackenzie data for 2025-2028 (underlying data set for 2019 o&m reports) and sgre’s estimate
for2029and2030.
11.5.4 competitive environment
by the end of 2019, there were more than 30 wind turbine oems in the world. in general terms,
windturbineoemscanbecategorizedinthreegroups:
(cid:129) international players with global reach, e.g., sgre, vestas (denmark), ge renewable energy
(france/unitedstates)andnordex(germany)
(cid:129) chineseoems,e.g.,goldwind(xinjianggoldwindscience&technologyco.,ltd.)andenvision
(cid:129) other regional oems (mostly located in india), e.g., suzlon energy ltd. and inox wind ltd.
(both,india)
the wind energy market in china is mainly served by local chinese oems. the total market share
ofnon-chineseoemsinthechinesemarket(newunitinstallation)hasbeenquitelowinthelast
years, for example around 3% in 2019 (in terms of new capacity installed), according to a wood
mackenzie database for “historical global wind turbine oem market share” (april 2020).
however, chinese oems also have a small market share in overseas markets: their share within
the total newunitmarketsegmentexcluding chinawas approximately 2%in 2019,according to
the same source, based on new capacity connected to the grid. overall, and because of the size
of the chinese wind energy market (the chinese onshore market accounted for approximately
43% of global onshore capacity additions in 2019), five of the top-10 global wind turbine oems
in 2019 came from china, according to the wood mackenzie database mentioned above and
wood mackenzie’s “global wind turbine oem 2019 market share”, april 29, 2020 (“wood
mackenzie2019marketsharereport”).
while remaining very competitive, the global wind energy market saw a clear trend of
consolidation in the past years. according to the wood mackenzie 2019 market share report,
the top-5 players accounted together for approximately 68% of total global wind energy new
capacity (onshore and offshore) installed in 2019. this aggregate share was 20 percentage
points higher than in 2015 (source: make (now wood mackenzie), “global wind turbine oem
2015 market share”, march 31, 2016). one of the drivers behind this consolidation are m&a
activities like the merger between siemens wind power and gamesa in 2017 or the merger
between acciona windpower and nordex in 2016. excluding china, the top three players
accounted together for approximately 83% of total global wind energy new capacity (onshore
andoffshore)installedin2019(source:woodmackenzie2019marketsharereport).

the major competitive factors in the wind power oem business are scale, global reach, cost
competitiveness, technology leadership and service capabilities. sgre and vestas are the two
leading players with the largest installed fleets in the industry, surpassing 100 gw each already
(source: wood mackenzie, “global wind power project installation database”, march 2020). a
large installed fleet also provides a solid foundation for the service business. major wind
industrial players have set a clear focus on the introduction of more powerful turbines and
continuedcost-outalongthewholevaluechaininordertolowerlcoe.
in recent years, many of the major oems have started to offer hybrid solutions, where storage
and/or pv are integrated into wind power plants. this reflects the continuous adjustment of
strategyandtechnologydevelopmenttomarkettrends.
11.5.4.1 competitiveenvironmentintheonshorenewunitmarketsegment
according to the wood mackenzie 2019 market share report, the top-5 global onshore market
players in 2019 in terms of new capacity installations were, in this order: vestas
(20%), ge renewable energy (15%), goldwind (13%), sgre (12%) and envision (9%), which
together accounted for approximately 69% of total onshore additions in 2019. excluding
china, sgre is ranked third in 2019, with a market share of approximately 20%, after vestas
(34%) andgerenewableenergy(25%) (source: woodmackenziedatabasefor “historical global
wind turbine oem market share”, april 2020). competition in the onshore new unit market
segment has been strong in recent years, with the average sales price for new wind turbine
generatorsdecliningatacagrofalmost7%overthe2015-2019period,accordingtobnef’s“4q
2019 global wind market outlook”. in the past few years, the industry has experienced
significant cost pressure across the whole value chain. some players with regionally limited
market access have faced significant challenges to keep up with the competition. according to
the ren21 2019 report, severe competition led to seven small turbine equipment manufacturers
exiting the market in 2018. in 2019, german-based senvion holding gmbh (“senvion gmbh”),
which was part of the top-10 wind turbine oems in 2017, filed for insolvency (selected assets of
senvion gmbh and senvion indústria, s.a. (together “senvion”) in europe were acquired by
sgre in 2020 (the “senvion acquisition”; see “12.9.3 acquisition of selected european assets of
senvion” for more details)) and suzlon defaulted on debt payments. however, major
international oems have reported a slowdown in downward pricing during the recent quarters
(as mentioned, for example, with reference to the three major oems sgre, vestas and ge, in the
article entitled “with prices stabilizing, turbine makers feel tailwinds rising”, published by s&p
globalmarketintelligenceinmay2019).
269
in order to further reduce the lcoe of onshore wind projects, all major players have been
launching higher-rated wind turbine generator models moving past 5 mw and increasing
rotor diameters beyond 150 meters. almost all major onshore players except for enercon and
goldwind work with geared power train setups. oems are striving for higher economies of
scalethroughbettermodularizationandlargerbusinessvolumes.
11.5.4.2 competitiveenvironmentintheoffshorenewunitmarketsegment
the offshore wind turbine business is characterized by significant entry barriers due to the high
investment required, both for technology development and for the manufacturing footprint,
high reliability requirements posed on offshore turbines as well as increased o&m requirements
duetothesignificanteffortneededtoconducton-sitemaintenanceorrepairactivities.
according to the wood mackenzie 2019 market share report, the top-5 offshore market
players worldwide in 2019 in terms of new installations were, in this order: sgre (39%),
mhi-vestas (15%), shanghai electric (se wind) (11%), envision (11%) and goldwind (9%), which
together accounted for approximately 85% of total offshore capacity additions in 2019. for the
markets outside china, sgre and mhi-vestas accounted for a market share of 65% and 25%,
respectively, in terms of 2019 new offshore installations (source: wood mackenzie database for
“historicalglobalwindturbineoemmarketshare”(april2020)).despitelimitedhistoricmarket
share, ge announced in 2018 an investment program of more than usd 400 million in the
developmentanddeploymentofanewoffshoreturbine(“haliade-x”).
as a market leader with nearly 30 years of experience in offshore (sgre was an offshore pioneer
– having provided turbines for the world’s first offshore wind power plant in vindeby, off the
coast of denmark, in 1991), sgre had installed more than 50% of the total global offshore fleet
by the end of 2019 (cumulative installed capacity figures according to wood mackenzie’s
database on “historical global wind turbine oem market share”, which includes new capacity
additions for (i) the period before 2009 and (ii) each of the years from 2009 until 2019). in 2019,
ge installed a prototype of its “haliade-x” 12 mw-220 offshore wind turbine and received
preferred supplier status for offshore projects totaling almost 5 gw. so far, chinese players
have offshore installations only in china, with shanghai electric being the clear leader in the
local market, having a share of more than 40% of total offshore cumulative installed capacity in
china as of the end of 2019. sgre has licensing agreements with shanghai electric for the
offshore wind power projects in mainland china’s territorial waters that cover sgre’s 4.0 mw,
6.0 mw, 7.0 mw and 8.0 mw offshore wind turbine technology. in may 2020, sgre publicly
announced its new offshore wind turbine, released with a nameplate capacity of 14 mw, but
which can reach 15 mw with a “power boost” option. the new 14 mw offshore wind turbine is
intended to be used at the upcoming 300 mw hai long 2 project in taiwan, subject to a final
decision of the consortium partners, and a deployment of the turbine for the rest of the 1,044
mwhailongpipelineisalsobeingconsidered.
for the offshore new unit market segment, sgre and ge rely on the direct-drive technology,
while mhi-vestas relies on mid-speed geared drive technology with a permanent magnet
generator. in general, it is to be expected that the trend towards increasing nameplate capacity
as well as blade size will continue also in the upcoming years. this also results in increasing
challenges relating to the manufacturing and logistics for offshore turbines. sgre sees itself well
prepared to meet such challenges due to its extensive experience and its continuous innovation
initiativesalongthevaluechain.
11.5.4.3 competitiveenvironmentintheservicemarketsegment
as mentioned under “11.5.3.3 service market segment”, the service (o&m) market segment of
the wind energy market is mainly served by oems. however, players also include an increasing
share of customers that insource o&m activities; these are mainly large utilities with a significant
installedfleetsize.
270
the foundation for an oem’s service business is its own installed fleet. sgre and vestas have by
far the largest installed fleet in the industry, with more than 100 gw each already. significant

in the rapidly changing market environment of the wind industry, the wind turbine fleets of
manywindpowerplantassetownersshowanincreasingdiversityoftechnologiesandbrands.as
owners expand their fleet sizes, most expand their fleets beyond a single turbine manufacturer,
either due to economic or performance-related considerations, or through the integration of
fleetsresultingfromm&aactivities.
for the past few years, in particular isps and some oems have placed increasing effort in
so-called “multi-brand services”, where turbines from other oems are serviced. for example,
vestas has completed two major acquisitions of isps in the past years (upwind solutions and
availon), which have supported the growth of its multi-brand service businesses. by the end of
2019, vestas’ multi-brand o&m fleet size was 7.4 gw (source: vestas’ brochure entitled “vestas
multibrand services”, 2020,available from vestas’ website). in january2020,sgrecompletedthe
acquisition of senvion’s european service assets and ip (excluding ip rights in india), which added
around 8.9 gw of serviced fleet and operations in 13 countries, taking sgre’s multi-brand
footprinttomorethan10gw.
furthermore, in the last years significant efforts have been put by the leading service oem
players in digitalization technology, with a focus on diagnostics and preventive service strategy.
sgre sees itself well-positioned also in this area, with continuous investment in innovation,
accordingtoitsownassessment.

12.2 investment highlights
our purpose and mission is to energize society, while supporting the transition towards a more
sustainable energy world with our innovative technologies and our ability to turn ideas into
reality.
12.2.1 leaderintheenergyindustry
siemens energy comprises the former energy infrastructure businesses of siemens ag operating
in two segments: gas and power and siemens gamesa renewable energy (sgre). the origins of
gas and power date back more than 150 years and we estimate that roughly 1/6 (one sixth) of
the world’s electricity generation is based on our technologies. siemens gamesa renewable
energy is a leader in wind power generation equipment with a history which began almost 40
years ago. sgre is a pioneer in offshore wind technology and more than 50% of the existing
global offshore wind fleet by the end of 2019 had been supplied by sgre (source: wood
mackenzie, “historical global wind turbine oem market share” database with cumulative
installedcapacityfigures,april2020).
we view siemens energy as one of the largest suppliers of technology in the energy and
electricity sector with an integrated offering that addresses a large part of the energy market.
we believe that we provide a leading portfolio along almost the entire energy value chain in
both conventional and renewable energy generation, energy transmission, oil and gas and other
processindustries.siemensenergy’s91thousandemployees(asofjune30,2020)inmorethan90
countries are supporting its customers around the globe with system critical energy
infrastructure.givenourleadingmarketpositions,highmarketentrybarriers,thebreadthofour
portfolio as well as our customer focus, we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from
the dynamic changes in our markets. because we are usually in a number one or two position in
273
our relevant markets globally, we consider siemens energy to be a leading global energy
infrastructure company. the breadth of our portfolio is reflected in our revenue mix. for
example, in the fiscal year 2019, our gas and power segment contributed 65% of our total
revenue of total segments, therein the transmission, generation and industrial applications
divisions total revenues with approximately 20%, 28% and 18% of our total revenue of total
segments, respectively. the generation division’s central and decentral business activities
estimated to account for approximately 24% (service: approximately 14%; new unit:
approximately 10%) and approximately 4% (new unit only) of our total new unit and service
revenue of total segments (including intercompany business), respectively. our sgre segment
contributed35%ofourtotalrevenueoftotalsegments.
we energize societies around the globe. we have experience in implementing electrification
roadmaps for whole countries. recent examples include countries such as egypt, where we
installed three combined-cycle power plants and six substations comprising gas-insulated
switchgear to transmit the electricity generated in egypt’s transmission system, which feed
electricity for 40 million people to the grid and enabled our customers to gain more than
€ 1 billion annual cost savings. in iraq, 11 gw are being added to the grid including amongst
others a 500 mw gas-fired power plant, 13 substations and 35 power transformers, providing
electricity for 38 million people. in bolivia more than 1 gw was addedto the grid by 23 sgt-800,
11 industrial steam turbines and 25 transformers providing 11 million people with electricity. in
bolivia,wehavealsoestablishedaserviceandtrainingcenter.
12.2.2 spin-offallowsforastepchangeinoperationalperformance
the spin-off offers the opportunity for siemens energy to further drive and improve its own
operationalperformance.
we are implementing a two-phased strategy program to which we refer as “energy of
tomorrow”. during the first phase (accelerating impact), which we expect to complete until the
fiscal year 2023, we will focus and deliver on the fundamentals, co-create innovations and start
theenergytransformation. thesecondphase(leadingtheenergytransformation)isdesignedto
makeusthemost-valuedenergycompany,whichelectrifiescountriesandcommunitiesandisthe
bestplacetowork.
in our gas and power segment, potential measures targeted to achieve an adjusted ebita
margin before special items in a range from 6% to 8% by fiscal year 2023 include the
streamlining of our portfolio, reshaping our footprint by increasing the share of workforce in
best-cost countries of below 25% as of today, potentially reducing our r&d centers to
concentrate our activities and build capabilities in best-cost countries while keeping a lean
corporate structure. in the project business we evaluate options to improve our margins and
reduce our currently high non-conformance costs. by the fiscal year 2023, we strive for a
reduction of our non-conformance costs by at least 30% (compared to the fiscal year 2019).
furthermore, we have defined measures in supply chain excellence, to sustainably reduce our
inventoryandtogetclosertoourcustomers.
we have set a clear path to deliver global cost savings through stringent cost out programs,
whichbothsegmentshavealreadyinitiatedandwhichareontrack.
as of june 30, 2020, the gas and power segment achieved gross cost savings of almost
€ 500 million, as compared to the fiscal year 2018. in addition, our programs “pg 2020” and “gp
2020+”areexpectedtoachievefurther globalcost savings ofatleast€500million bytheendof
fiscalyear2023,ascomparedtothefiscalyear2018.
to achieve our targets, we are evaluating potential further restructuring and optimization
measures, in particular, for the implementation of a function optimization program within our
“gp 2020+”program and the optimization of our footprint and our project execution. aspartof
the ongoing evaluation process, we are closely analyzing how such measures could be designed
and what consequences they would have for siemens energy, our customers and our employees.
while the evaluation process may further crystalize in the near future already, no resolution has
274
been made yet on future measures and these measures are subject to consultation with
employee representatives. also, the findings of this process will be discussed in the relevant
committees,whichwillsubsequentlytakeadecision.
in total, our restructuring and optimization programs and the potential further measures
outlined above aim at global cost savings of around € 700 million by the fiscal year 2021 and are
expected to exceed the originally targeted global cost savings for the fiscal year 2023 of around
€ 1 billion by at least € 300 million, compared to the fiscal year 2018. on the basis of these
programs and measures, we target additional global cost savings in the low triple digit euro
millionrangebythefiscalyear2025.
for more information, see “9.4.10.1 restructuring and integration measures in our gas and
powersegment”.
as the majority shareholder of our sgre segment, we believe that we are best placed to support
the unlocking of its full potential. the strong business of our sgre segment with its 100%

onshore wind and is a pioneer in offshore wind technologies with more than 50% of existing
offshore installations provided by sgre (cumulative installed capacity figures according to wood
mackenzie’s database on “historical global wind turbine oem market share”, which includes
new capacity additions until the end of 2019). at the same time, its end-market is expected to
grow strongly both in offshore and service and to remain large in onshore (e.g., at a cagr of
22% from 2019 to 2025 in offshore wind installations (source: wood mackenzie, “global wind
power market update: q2 2020”, june 2020)). with its new “leap” program, sgre plans to
turnaround onshore into sustainable profitability and to capture the growth potential that
offshore and service offer. our sgre segment plans to maintain focus in productivity and asset
management and also in operational excellence, innovation, digitalization and sustainability and
people.
furthermore, we will be focusing on dedicated strategies and synergy realization designed to
untap sgre’s full potential. we see significant synergy potential resulting from collaboration in
areas such as procurement, go-to market and strategic collaborations, among others. from a
strategic perspective, fields like the service business, where both companies enjoy significant
operations, or clean hydrogen, where both companies arepresentin complementary parts ofthe
value chain offer collaboration potential that will be explored. intensified cooperation between
the gas and power segment, siemens ag and the sgre segment is expected to deliver annual
costsavingsofupto€100million.

12.2.3 leadingportfoliointheindustry
in our view, the disruptive trends defining the energy markets are demand growth,
decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization. while posing great challenges, we believe
thatwehavethepeople,experienceandskillstocapitalizeonthesetrends.
(cid:129) demandgrowth–primaryenergydemandandfinalenergyconsumptionareexpectedtogrow
in the medium- to long-term, despite ongoing increases in energy efficiency. under the iea’s
stated policies scenario as well as the sustainable development scenario, electricity demand is
expected to grow at a cagr of approximately 2% over the 2018-2040 period (source: weo
2019). all of our activities are directly or indirectly involved in supplying energy where and
whenitisneeded.accordingly,demandgrowthoffersopportunitiesforalldivisionsofourgas
andpowersegmentandofoursgresegment,e.g.,inasiapacific.
(cid:129) decarbonization – global efforts to reduce the level of ghg emissions and the determination
tofightclimatechangehaveintensifiedoverthelastdecades.decarbonizationisakeyleverto
lower the amounts of ghg emitted globally and is acting as an important driver for the
transformation of the energy sector. under the iea’s stated policies scenario and the
sustainable development scenario, renewables are expected to account for 44% and 67%,
respectively, of the global electricity generation by 2040 (source: weo 2019). this trend has
triggered a shift towards renewables and sector coupling based on hydrogen. although more
than 50% of our portfolio is decarbonized per fiscal year 2019, we believe that renewables
alone will not be able to cover the world’s electricity needs in the foreseeable future,
translating into a growing needfor highly efficient conventionalpowergenerationequipment
and the modernization of existing fossil-based generation equipment. we therefore expect
increases in wind power demand, new demands in transmission and an emerging market for
electrolyzers.
(cid:129) decentralization: renewable and conventional electricity is increasingly generated decentrally.
distributed energy systems comprise not just decentral generation, but also local energy
storage as well as demand response. while we expect centralized generation units to continue
to play an important role in the foreseeable future, we expect the trend towards
decentralization to persist. particularly, the shift towards decentralization in gas will create
opportunities for small and medium gas turbines and new solutions in our industrial
applicationsdivision.
(cid:129) digitalization–digitaltechnologiesandtheresultingchangesinconsumerbehavior,combined
with corresponding regulatory initiatives, are expected to change energy markets
276
fundamentally. as interconnectivity, data availability and the degree of automation continue
to increase, new business opportunities across all stages of the energy technology value chain
arise. specifically energy technology players can improve their existing offering with asset-
related digital offerings and expand their portfolio with new standalone software as service
solutions. in addition, the increasing automation of processes enabled through digitalization
presentsthefundamentforproductivityimprovements.
as a result of these trends, there is a variety of equipment and service requirements which differ
across countries depending on the existing infrastructure, the availability of fuel, wealth and
environmental policies. our leading market positions across different technologies, the efficiency
andreliabilityofourproducts,oursolutionsexpertiseandthequalityofourserviceswillallowus
to capitalize on these trends as the individual needs of our customers around the globe differ
widely. while we anticipate the rapid shift from fossil-based fuels to renewables to continue in
european countries, we expect countries with access to fossil fuels not to shift directly from fossil
to renewable power, but initially to transition from coal to gas to lower emissions in the existing
infrastructure. as an example, we see in asia, australia opportunities for revenue growth for all
our businesses driven by the need for grid development, increasing industrial growth, a growing
share of wind and the shift from coal and nuclear to gas. technology partnerships enable us to
accesscertainmarketsmoreefficiently.
supporting a transition from coal to gas ties in with our efforts to contribute to a sustainable
energyindustrywhichalsoincludesacommitmenttoreachnet-zerogreenhousegasemissionsof
our own business operations (climate neutrality) by 2030. in this context, we are reviewing the
details of the phase-out of our coal-related business activities in the long run. as part of this
review process, we are currently closely evaluating what consequences such phase-out would
have for siemens energy, our customers and our employees. the findings of this review will be
discussed in the relevant committees, which will subsequently take a decision. as part of the
phase-out of our coal-related business activities, we would likely stop supporting the
construction of new coal-fired power plants, while we would, of course, continue to honor any
contractual obligations that were created prior to a final decision being taken on this matter.
furthermore, we expect to continue to offer our services for existing coal-fired power plants. we
want to use our business relationships with coal-fired power plant operators to offer, among
other things, co -reducing solutions that minimize the adverse effects of coal-fired power
2
generation.
12.2.4 servicebusinessasacorevaluedriver
we are determined to transform siemens energy into a product-led service company with
significantcontributionsfromservicesacrossallbusinesses.
our gas and power segment has a large installed base of more than 90,000 service-relevant units
(as of june 30, 2020; including large, industrial gas and aero-derivative gas turbines, large and
industrial steam turbines and compressors) as well as more than 100 gw installed capacity at
sgre globally. this installed base provides the foundation of our resilient and high-margin
service business, which amounted to total revenue of € 9.5 billion, representing almost one third
of siemens energy’s total segments’ revenue in the fiscal year 2019. as of september 30, 2019,
we had a service order backlog of € 35 billion in our gas and power segment and € 12 billion in
oursgresegment,providinguswithastrongbasisforfutureprofitablerevenuegeneration.
our growing and highly profitable service business provides us with continuous customer touch
points and is a key profit contributor, characterized by a high level of resilience to main
macroeconomic shocks. themain reasonsfor this arethreefold: (i) energyinfrastructure is critical
and needs to be maintained in order to provide electricity, (ii) we have a broad customer base
and (iii) our products are highly sophisticated which creates significant entry barriers to the
service business. in addition, this technical sophistication of our products and the quality of the
services we offer leads to a high conversion rate between new installations and service contracts.
as an example, we estimate a conversion rate of close to 100% for high efficiency large gas
turbines and estimated renewal rates of 60% for low efficiency gas turbines of our generation
277
division (which we target to increase to 70% by the end of 2020) in our gas and power segment
based on new unit projects sold together with service agreements. in our sgre segment, we
estimate a capture rate of approximately 60% based on our serviced own installed fleet
compared to total installations. we estimate a high contract retention rate of approximately
80% and an average duration of approximately 12 years for long-term service programs in our
gasandpowersegmentandapproximately9yearsonaverageinoursgresegment(ineachcase
asofjune30,2020).
the long life-time of our products coupled with the high level of wear and tear during
operations and increased fleet utilization in most regions lead to a particularly large share of
service revenue as a percentage of total revenue. especially the long-term service contracts
generate a continuous revenue flow due to regular service inspections. due to the rapid growth

the services we offer are maintenance, spare parts, modernizations and upgrades and
increasingly digital services. in maintenance, it is critical for our customers to keep installations
operating at the designated performance level with little or no unscheduled downtime.
21 thousand highly skilled employees (as of june 30, 2020) active in 73 service centers in the
world and sophisticated spare part logistics help us to support our customers running their
machinery at maximum uptime and as efficient as possible. our leading-edge product portfolio
does not just help us to grow the installed base, but also feeds our modernization and upgrade
activities, which are on average due after 20 years where we can often achieve significant
efficiency improvements (cost reductions) for the customer. digital services and innovation allow
for an optimization of our customers’ fleets, remote monitoring and predictive maintenance

12.2.6 increaseebitaandcashconversion
siemens energy has a clearly defined financial framework to drive shareholder value. we have
identified the improvement of adjusted ebita and cash conversion rate as the key value drivers
for siemens energy. for details on our profit forecasts for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 as well
as profitability and/or revenue targets for the fiscal year 2023 and the mid-term, see “22 recent
developmentsandoutlook”.
278
our financial performance has stabilized pre covid-19 with a stable topline and growing
backlog. we strive to lift our significant upside potential in profitability and cash generation
even though challenging market environment and covid-19 impacts are expected to lead to a
decline of adjusted ebita margin before special items to an expected (1)% to 1% in fiscal year
2020. the accelerating impact phase of our energy of tomorrow program is expected to deliver
an adjusted ebita margin before special items in a range from 6.5% to 8.5% by the fiscal year
2023. in the mid-term, as a result of the leading the energy transformation phase of our energy
oftomorrowprogram,wetargetanadjustedebitamarginafterspecialitemsofatleast8%.
for the fiscal year 2023, we target a cash conversion rate of 1 minus the cagr of revenue,
excluding portfolio effects and currency effects, over the fiscal years 2021 to 2023. these key
performance indicators are captured by the siemens energy’s incentive framework. pursuant to

12.3 gas and power segment
our gas and power segment comprises our transmission, generation and industrial applications
divisions. together, these businesses cover key parts of the energy value chain and serve a broad
base of customers with products, solutions and services for the energy infrastructure markets as
described in our industry section (see “11 industry overview”). the key trends demand growth,
decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization are common to all divisions within the gas
and power segment, however, each is affected differently by these trends. to address the
transformation in our markets we are developing new products, solutions and services, in
particular hydrogen-based solutions as part of our new energy business. with our more than
90,000 service-relevant units, as of june 30, 2020 in our installed fleet and more than 12 years
average ltp contract duration we have a resilient backbone to our business with a truly global
fleet with approximately two-third installed in europe and north america and a growing fleet in
asia. based on our global fleet footprint increased large gas turbine utilization rates during the
fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, especially in asia, europe and north america resulted in high
revenue recognition. our total service revenue of € 7,931 million in the fiscal year 2019 can
largely be attributed to gas turbines including our large gas turbine, industrial gas turbine and
aero-derivative gas turbine business. we seek to continue to grow our fleet and expect in terms
of number of units until 2025 the highest growth from the transmission division and our
industrial and our smaller aero-derivative gas turbines. we anticipate a stable outlook for our
large gas turbines and a small decline in our steam fleet. in terms of revenue per unit we expect
an overall growth, again with the highest increase coming from the transmission division and
industrial and aero-derivative gas turbines and a stable development in large gas turbines and
steam. however, we will over time no longer actively market our larger sized aero-derivative gas
turbines(formoreinformation,see“12.3.3.1.2(2)aero-derivativegasturbines”).
operating in onesegmentallows all ofourbusinesses toleveragetheir leadingmarketpositions,
the siemens energy brand, our global footprint in more than 90 countries and our industry
know-how. we have a common approach to r&d of, e.g., digital solutions or additive
manufacturing, project excellence, manufacturing and procurement. as demonstrated by our
large lng-to-power projects (see “12.3.5 project development and execution”), the
comprehensive offerings of our transmission, generation and industrial applications divisions
enable to us provide our customers with integrated solutions. together with our sgre segment
we believe our gas and power segment is uniquely positioned to deliver complex large projects
up to major infrastructure upgrades for entire countries andtoservethewidely varyingneedsof
ourcustomersaroundtheglobe.
we believe that our gas and power segment is well diversified based on the regional split of its
revenue by location of customer in the fiscal year 2019 between emea, americas and asia,
australia,whichamountedto49%,33%and18%,respectively.
279
in order to overcome structural issues in the gas and power segment we initiated programs (see
“9.4.10 integration and operational improvement measures; special items”) to reshape our
footprint, foster project excellence, streamline our portfolio in each of the divisions, excel in
supply chain, sustainably reduce inventories and get closer to our customers. as of june 30, 2020,
we operated 104 sites with more than 50 employees each, thereof 75, 89 and 73 primarily served
as a basis for our (i) manufacturing, (ii) sales, execution, engineering (here, including sites with
more than 25 employees) and (iii) service relevant internal facilities. in r&d, we run 15 centers
withouremployeesspreadinmorethan90locations.asofthesamedate,approximately20%of
our employees were located at our ten largest sites. reducing the complexity of our footprint is
one of our priorities. furthermore, we aim to increase the utilization levels of our factories by
optimizingourfactorynetworkandimprovingconnectivityviadigitalization.
inthepast,ourprofitabilitywasnegativelyaffectedbyhighproposalandnon-conformancecosts
incurred in connection with project execution and selection. accordingly, we have made it our
priorities to reduce non-conformance costs by 30% and to increase the share of high margin
projects (project selectivity) until the fiscal year 2023 in each case as compared to fiscal year 2019
levels. by overlooking approximately 2,700 projects in execution or warranty (projects with more
than € 2.5 million order intake per project; as of april 30, 2020) we will foster our project
excellence and have implemented projectdash, a unified reporting system combining more than
20 legacy systems to improve performance by increasing transparency. furthermore, to improve
portfolio analytics and systematic risk management we will implement new unified project
managementandselectionsystemforempiricalbaseddecisionmakingandmonthlykpitracking.
a similar approach had successfully been implemented in siemens mobility reducing the
non-conformancecostsby55%andimprovingprojectmarginsby350bpsfrom2013to2019.
we strive to reduce material and organizational costs by an improved supplier base through e.g.
reducing the number of suppliers in some commodities by 30%, fully exploiting our sourcing
levers e.g. by increasing our global value sourcing share by up to 30% in some businesses, cost
value engineering, simplifying our procurement organization, maintaining the procurement
alliancewithsiemensandthedigitalizationofprocurement.
furthermore, we are targeting to optimize our rounded 125 days of inventory, which is
calculated based on inventories amounting to € 5,294 million divided by cost of sales before
amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments
amounting to € 15,403 million multiplied by 364.25 calendar days as of september 30, 2019 or
thefiscalyear2019,respectively.
in order to get closer to our customers, we target to foster our key account management,
providedifferentiatedofferings,expandourasianbusiness,increaseourshareofpubliclyfunded
projects with customer co-development, provide customized project financing (see also
“12.3.5 project development and execution”) and strive for intensified outage coordination as
wellasimplementaclearaccountabilitythroughend-to-endproductresponsibility.
across the gas and power segment, we plan to drive our service margins by increased
productivity, field service tools and utilization, and innovation, e.g., advanced repairs and
technology download from product development, by increasing focus on service r&d and field
serviceutilization.
12.3.1 transmissiondivision
theintegrationofrenewablesandthetrendtowardsdistributedpowergenerationaswellasthe
liberalization of energy markets is leading to an increasing complexity of grid infrastructures.
our transmission division caters to these requirements by providing, what we believe to be an
industry-leading and innovative portfolio focused on the key market trends: digitalization,
decarbonization, grid stability and electrification (see “11.2.2 market size, development and
trends”). in our view, these include the most advanced, leading-edge products and systems as
well as complex solutions, such as hvdc offshore grid connection. revenue from new units
contributed approximately 92% of the division’s total new unit and service revenue in the fiscal
year 2019 and revenue from services approximately 8%, respectively (including intercompany
business). most recent innovations include digital products such as the sensformer and sensgear,
280
which also provide a basis for other digital services. to reduce environmentally-harmful assets in
the infrastructure, we offer products such as gas-insulated switchgear without sf (one of the

12.3.1.1.1 switchgear
a switchgear is the switching part of a substation which is used to control, protect and isolate
electrical equipment. in electricity grids, voltage levels are increased or decreased at substations,
and this change in voltage levels is realized by the main transformer (for our transmission
division’s transformer offering, see “12.3.1.1.2 transformers”). the various equipment parts,
includingcircuitbreakers,disconnectors,surgearresters,currentandvoltagetransformersaswell
as earthing switches, measure and switch electric power on or off for the main transformer and
power line; all of this is collectively referred to as a switchgear. typically, a switchgear is located
onboththeprimaryandsecondaryvoltagesidesofthemaintransformer. themainpurposeofa
switchgear is to connect or disconnect power paths, i.e., power lines, power producers or
consumers. the different components of a switchgear must be duly insulated to ensure their
proper function. this insulation can be achieved by air (air-insulated switchgear) or gas
(gas-insulatedswitchgear).
(1) air-insulatedswitchgear
air-insulated switchgear can be used for voltages of up to 1,200 kv and regularly require tailor-
made solutions. the installation of air-insulated switchgear is influenced by the site, existing
infrastructure and accessibility. in addition, the incoming and outgoing lines, the number and
position of transformers and the rated voltage levels for which the switching devices are built
must also be considered. air-insulated switchgear requires more space than gas-insulated
switchgear. on the other hand, air-insulated switchgear is more cost-efficient than gas-insulated
switchgear. our transmission division’s air-insulated switchgear comprises circuit breakers,
disconnectors, earthing switches, surge arresters and insulators. circuit breakers interrupt short
circuit currents in caseofafault. theyusethesignals providedbytheinstrument transformers as
abasisforbreakingoperationsunderfaultconditionsandarefundamentaltonetworkreliability
and security. disconnectors and earthing switches are used to ensure that an electric circuit is
282
completelyde-energizedandsafelyearthedtoallowisolationofvariousapparatussuchascircuit
breakers and transformers for maintenance, refurbishment and replacement. disconnectors are
usually not intended for normal control of the circuit, but only for safety isolation. surge
arresters protect electrical equipment from over-voltage. during normal operation, a surge
arrester is designed to avoid negative effects on the power system. a surge arrester diverts the
excessvoltagetogroundandisbuilttowithstandtypicalsurgeswithoutincurringanydamage.

short distance between a substation and the consumer results in more economical and better-
quality power supply. accordingly, the customers of our transmission division often seek to build
substations close to urban centers where space is limited. this is where gas-insulated switchgear
can make a positive contribution. they serve the same purpose as air-insulated switchgear but
require significantly less space. this type of switchgear provides higher economic efficiency
compared to air-insulated switchgear and high reliability, as well as low noise and
electromagnetic emissions. the different components of a switchgear are enclosed in a gas-tight
metal enclosure. their compact design allows for use in confined spaces, whether in a basement
of a high-rise building, in an industrial plant or in a mobile container. further, gas-insulated
switchgear offers numerous advantages, from flexible switchgear designs to a long product life
as well as low life cycle and maintenance costs. the comprehensive range of our transmission
division’s gas-insulated switchgear for rated voltages from 72.5 kv up to 550 kv provides
solutionsthatareparticularlysuitableforchallengingandcomplexindoorandoutdoorswitching
applications. its conventional gas-insulated switchgear use sf gas as insulation medium between
6
live parts of the equipment and the metal enclosure. due to a strong global footprint, it is well-
positionedinthecompetitiveenvironmentasagas-insulatedswitchgearmanufacturer.
(bb) blueswitchgear
since 2010, the air- and gas-insulated switchgear series were innovated with the launch of the
blue series. the blue series of switchgear features an sf gas-free design, which provides clear
6
environmental benefits. it uses a proven vacuum interrupter technology with compressed
synthetic air (clean air) as an insulating medium. synthetic air is a non-toxic, non-flammable,
stable insulation medium. webelievethatthis technologywill comply with upcomingnorms and
standards for environmentally-friendly insulation mediums. the portfolio of blue switchgear is
available today for rated voltages up to 145 kv. in the coming years, our transmission division
plans to expand the portfolio to include blue switchgear for rated voltages up to 550 kv. like
conventional switchgear, blue portfolio elements offer safeandeasyhandling, maintenance-free
operation as well as high operational safety. however, blue switchgear are currently more costly
and in case of gas-insulated switchgear require more space than conventional switchgear. based
on the environmentally-friendly blue series of switchgear, we believe that our transmission
divisioniswellpositionedtomeetexpectedfuturedemandfortheseproducts.
12.3.1.1.2 transformers
whether in infrastructure, industry or households, transformers play a key role in the reliable
transmission and distribution of power. the rated power, voltage level, available space and the
specific use case are all important factors that determine a transformer’s design. the
transmission division provides different types of transformers for varying needs – from compact
distribution transformers to large power transformers. the transformers are embedded in a
completepowersystemencompassingpowergeneration,transmissionanddistributionnetworks.
(1) powertransformers
power transformers are a core component of power transmission systems, which are designed to
deliver power to consumers efficiently and reliably. power transformers include generator
step-up transformers, step-down transformers and system interconnecting transformers.
283
generator step-up transformers are essential elements which create a link between the power
station and the transmission network. they have to be built to withstand extreme thermal
loading without ageing prematurely. they are responsible for the safe and reliable transmission
of generated electricity from the power plant to the substations. generator step-up transformers
transform the voltage from the generator voltage level up to the transmission voltage level.
step-down transformers transform the voltage down from the transmission voltage level to a
required distribution voltage level. system interconnecting transformers provide connections
between different voltage systems, so that active as well as reactive power can be exchanged
betweenthesystems.
our transmission division offers all types of power transformers whether small, medium or large
transformers. all of its transformers are highly customizable to best address the specific needs of
each customer. small power transformers are transformers from 5 mega volt ampere (“mva”) to
30 mva with a maximum service voltage of 145 kv. they are used as network transformers in
distribution networks. medium power transformers feature a power range from 30 mva to
250 mva and a voltage of over 72.5 kv up to 300 kv and are used as network and generator
step-up transformers. in the power range above 250 mva and 300 kv, generator and system
interconnecting transformers with de-energizedoron-loadtapchangersarecategorizedaslarge
power transformers. even ratings of more than 1,000 mva and voltages up to 800 kv / 1,200 kv
areachievedbylargepowertransformers.
moreover,ourtransmissiondivisionoffersitscustomersbenefitfromthepretactconceptwhich
is aimed at ensuring the continuous operation of their critical transformers, thereby contributing
to increased grid resilience. events such as the big blackout in canada in 1989 and the 2012
blackout in manhattan due to hurricane sandy have exposed the crucial role of transformers in
grid resiliency. pretact is a mix of products and services based on the three pillars: “prevent”,
“protect” and “react”. this means that malfunctions of transformers due to aging or network
failures should be prevented by monitoring, maintenance, repair and retrofit services. further,
the transmission division has developed several designs to protect transformers against natural
disasters (e.g., sun storms and the resulting geomagnetically induced current, earthquakes, etc.)
and other forced outages (e.g., assaults with firearms). if all preventive and protective measures
fail,thetransmissiondivisionreactsbyswiftlydeployingemergencycountermeasures,whichmay

(2) distributiontransformers
in traditional networks, distribution transformers are used to transform the distributed high or
medium voltage to low voltage levels that can be used in industries, infrastructure and
households.distributiontransformersareusedatthelaststepintheconversionchainthatbrings
electricity to consumers. they are also used at the first transformation step to feed power
generated at lower voltage level by renewable sources like wind power generation into the
electricity grid. the portfolio of distribution transformers ranges from fluid-immersed
distribution transformers (fitformer series) over voltage regulators to cast-resin-insulated / dry
type transformers (geafol series). these products can be customized in detail to meet individual
customerrequirements.
in the wake of an enhanced electrification and decarbonization of industries, distribution
transformers play an increasingly important role to support the sustainable system integration of
producingindustries,datacenters,e-mobilityanddistributedrenewablegeneration.
284
(3) othertransformers
in addition to its main transformer portfolio range, our transmission division also provides a
wide range of special transformers for different applications, some of which gain special
importance with the need to increase integration of intermittent renewable power into the
powergrid.
(aa) hvdctransformers
hvdc transformers are key components of dc transmission networks that enable the
transmission of large energy amounts with high efficiency (i.e., minimal losses) over long
distances. with the increase of renewable energy generation and rising energy prices,
interconnection and power exchange between large transmission grids is becoming increasingly
more common. hvdc transformers establish back-to-back links for connecting two ac networks
with deviating frequencies. these types of transformers are key coupling elements between ac
grids and high-power rectifiers. they adapt the voltage, insulate the rectifier from the ac grid
andgenerateaphaseshiftfordcpowertransmissionathigh,extra-high-andultra-high-voltage.

within its hvdc transformer portfolio, our transmission division offers hvdc classic, hvdc plus
anduhvdc(i.e.,ultrahigh-voltagedirectcurrent)transformers.
(bb) productsforgridstabilization
phase-shifting transformers are devices for controlling the power flow through specific lines in a
complex power transmission network. they ensure grid stability and reliability by actively
balancing fluctuating power flows. this makes these transformers anessential equipmentfor the
operationofthegrid,inparticularduetotheincreasinginfeedofvolatilerenewableenergy.the
basic function of a phase-shifting transformer is to change the effective phase displacement
between the input voltage and the output voltage of a transmission line, thus controlling the
amount of active power that can flow in the line. it improves the stability and flexibility of grids
by enforcing or blocking the loads or by creating balance of load sharing between two
transmissionlines.
reactors can be used to limit over voltage and compensate reactive power (shunt reactors) or
changecurrent flow andlimit short circuit currents (series reactors) withanincreasingnumberof
high,extra-highandultra-highvoltageoverheadlineswithlongtransmission.
(cc) specialtransformersforindustrialandrailwayapplications
transformers are also used in a variety of industrial applications, including steel manufacturing,
electrolysis, mining as well as offshore oil and gas platforms. these industries require specific
high current application transformers due to the high usage of power (current) as a major
resourceforproduction.
railway applications need special transformers to transform available power voltage to the
overhead contact line voltage, which ranges mainly from 15 kv to 25 kv, to voltages suitable for
traction converters between 0.7 kv and 1.5 kv in the train. transformers must ensure continuous
operation under heavy overload and withstand frequent short circuits to assure uninterrupted
trainoperations.
12.3.1.1.3 sensformerandsensgear
digitalized transmission and distribution products are a key enabler to manage decentralization
and drive decarbonization for sustainable energy systems. connectivity of assets is the first step
towards digitalization. our transmission division equips all of its new transformers (since 2018)
andswitchgearwithsensorsandadigitalinterfaceenablingeasyremotereal-timemonitoringof
285
key parameters. these features are referred to as “sensformer” and “sensgear”, respectively.
they aim to increase productivity, reduce unplanned downtime and improve performance.
sensformer and sensgear use a smart and robust internet of things (iot) gateway which securely
transmits a minimum amount of required information to a cloud-based storage and visualization
platform. in “sensformer advanced” our transmission division’s visualization software allows its
customers to monitor a digital twin of the reporting equipment in real time with a variety of
features (internet of energy). each sensformer and sensgear has a unique id, which is also used
for encryption to provide a high level of cybersecurity. so far, we have seen strong growth rates
foroursensproductsandtheirdigitaltwins.
12.3.1.1.4 bushings,instrumenttransformersandcoilproducts
the transmission division’s core high-, medium- and low-voltage components include a range of
bushings, instrument transformers and coil products. generally, all these components are highly
customizabletobestmeetcustomerneeds.
bushings are electrical components that insulate a high-voltage conductor carrying current
passing through a metal enclosure or building. they are used for both ac and dc applications.
ourtransmissiondivisionoffersseveraltypesofbushingsrangingfrom24kvto1.200kvvoltage

between live parts of the equipment and the metal enclosure. however, as part of its innovative
blueseries,ourtransmissiondivisionalsoofferssf gas-freecurrentandvoltagetransformers.

in addition, modern non-conventional instrument transformers support digitalization of
substations and therefore help reducing wiring efforts and also improving the overall substation
footprint.
coil products are used, among others, to minimize capacitive power transmission losses, to limit
powersurgesandtofilteroutoscillations.
12.3.1.2 transmissionsolutions
transmission solutions include substations in which switchgear, transformers and high-voltage
components are installed and operated. our transmission division also offers modern solutions
for managing complexity in the electricity grid through its facts and dc interconnectors as well
asgridaccesssolutionsforconnectingdistributedgenerationsourcestotheelectricitygrid.
12.3.1.2.1 turnkeysubstations
around the globe, on either a turnkey basis or as a general contractor, our transmission division
plans and construct high-, extra-high- and ultra-high-voltage substations comprising switchgear,
other electrical equipment and transformers as well as all ancillary equipment such as control
systems, protective equipment, etc. the services offered range from system planning to
commissioning and after-sales service, including training of customer personnel. all these
installations have in common their high standard of engineering which covers all system aspects
such as power systems, steel structures, civil engineering, fire precautions, environmental
protectionandcontrolsystems.
12.3.1.2.2 mobiletransmissionsolutions(“e-houses”)
our transmission division provides a range of prefabricated substations that are equally suited
for either temporary or permanent use in challenging grid expansion and maintenance
programs. our transmission division’s mobile transmission solutions consist of self-contained
“plug and play” switching stations built as a fully mobile substation on a trailer, a skid, or inside
286
a shelter as an “e-house”. the modules contain all components for a complete substation,
including the power transformer, the gas-insulated switchgear, medium-, high- and extra-high-
voltage cables, protection, monitoring and control systems as well as auxiliary ac and dc power
supplies. the high mobility of a mobile transmission solution enables grid operators to restore
power after a substation failure within short time. it also helps to avoid disruptions during grid
maintenance and upgrade works. mobile transmission solutions enable faster and more reliable
grid connection for power-critical infrastructures such as electrical generation or process
industries, and they ensure little exposure to site work contingencies. as a true “plug and play”
solution, the mobile transmission solution requires little civil work, as it comes entirely
pre-assembledandfactory-tested.thisreducessiteworkstoanabsoluteminimum.
12.3.1.2.3 flexiblealternatingcurrenttransmissionsystems(facts)
the important shift of the energy mix towards an increasing share of renewables challenges grid
operators with respect to enabling a safe and reliable transmission grid operation. in order to
handle the resulting unpredictable load situations, our transmission division has developed
various solutions to ensure network stability. these solutions focus on managing reactive power,
frequency and power flow. these solutions are referred to as flexible alternating current
transmission systems (facts) and are continuously enhanced in line with customer requirements.
for example, our transmission division recently developed a facts system permitting system
operators to store and release energy into the electricity grid to stabilize frequency. with these
solutions installed in the system, unacceptably high voltage fluctuations and power failures can
be prevented, network assets can be efficiently utilized, and load-induced disturbances can be
mitigated.
in addition, our transmission division provides tailor-made synchronous condenser solutions
based on a facts network control and on its generator and transformer expertise and portfolio.
with this offering, our transmission division supports tsos in reducing redispatch costs, i.e., costs
incurred by tsos in connection with the balancing of power supply and demand in electricity
grids. its synchronous condensers consist of a synchronous generator, sourced from the product
portfolio of our generation division, and a step-up transformer integrated and combined with
intelligent grid control from transmission solutions. synchronous condensers can provide steady-
stateanddynamicvoltagecontrolaswellasreactivepowercontrolofdynamicloads.
12.3.1.2.4 high-voltagedc(hvdc)transmissionsystems
our transmission division provides a comprehensive portfolio of efficient and sustainable
solutions in a broad variety of fields of hvdc application. hvdc technology is particularly well
suited to support and improve the sustainability, efficiency and reliability of power supply
systems. hvdc transmission systems supplement the existing ac infrastructure in a number of
ways, including through highly efficient long-distance power transmission, transnational grid
connections as well as through the connection of asynchronous grids and grids with different
frequencies.
over the last years, demand for large-scale power exchange over long distances and often across
nationalbordershasincreasedsteadily.tosupportthisenergyexchange,interconnectorshaveto
be built bridging long distances, e.g., to cross seas. the energy transition towards renewable
energies has resulted in an increase in distances between power generation (e.g., in offshore
wind power plants) and electricity consumers. transportingenergyusingacsystems is inefficient
over long distances. thus, the more efficient hvdc transmission solutions are becoming
increasingly important to connect large-scale renewable generation and load centers. our
transmission division’s hvdc technology has been successfully installed in more than 50 projects
worldwide. our transmission division believes it is the best available solution for long-distance
transmission, grid access, and grid stability. today, its hvdc portfolio comprises two models:
hvdc classic transmission systems with line-commuted converters, and hvdc plus transmission
systemswithvoltage-sourcedconverter.

12.3.1.2.5 medium-voltagedc(mvdc)transmissionsystems
our transmission division’s medium-voltage dc (“mvdc”) transmission systems addresses the
challenges that regional high-voltage transmission networks and medium-voltage distribution
grids increasingly must deal with. the mvdc portfolio aims to apply the advantages of dc
technologyavailableforapplicationsintraditionallyacnetworks.
mvdc plus is an innovative universal solution designed to help handle issues such as unstable
grids, remote area connections, increased power infeed and increased autonomy from power
transmission. compact and cost-efficient mvdc plus connections via cable or compact overhead
lines enable cost-efficient power transmission over distances. we believe that these systems are
ideal for the grid connection of islands, offshore platforms and remote locations as well as the
interconnectionofautonomoussmartgrids.
mvdc plus is based on modular multilevel voltage-sourced converter technology. this mature
technology has proven its efficiency and performance in numerous hvdc plus and svc plus
applicationssinceitsfirstoperationin2010.
12.3.1.2.6 gridaccesssolutions
grid access solutions are custom-engineered solutions for distributed generating units and
remote loads. they are an essential part of so-called “intelligent grid solutions”. grid access

and efficient transmission in the best possible way. for example, in the design of high-, extra-
highandultra-high-voltageoffshoreplatformsforoffshorewindpowerplantconnectionstothe
grid, grid access solutions optimize the entire system with particularly well suited 66 kv and
above voltage equipment to balance life cycle costs as well as performance and electrical losses,
meeting local grid code requirements. by offering a turnkey solution, our transmission division
provides a comprehensive approach for complex projects involving project management, design
and engineering services, subcontracting, procurement and expediting of equipment, inspection
of equipment prior to delivery, shipment, transportation, control of schedule and quality,
pre-commissioning and completion, performance guarantee testing, and training of owner’s
operating and/or maintenance personnel. our transmission division believes that it is uniquely
positioned with its broad in-house engineering competence, from the initial system studies work
through to primary and secondary engineering, including platform design/management
competence.
webelieve,thatweareatechnologyleaderintheareaofgridaccesssolutions.forexample,the

technological breakthrough for connecting large offshore wind parks to the grid (source: world
economic forum, white paper entitled “global innovations from the energy sector 2010-2020”,
may 2020). furthermore, our innovative ac offshore grid connection solutions rely on offshore
transformer modules, which can reduce the size and weight of offshore platforms by
approximately 30% compared to conventional ac substations whilst providing the same or even
higherpowerranges.

12.3.2.2.4 decarbonizedsolutions
decarbonized solutions support our customers in the energy transformation towards more
sustainable, yet affordable and reliable solutions. our decarbonization support addresses both
individual projects and global fleet transformation over time. we see ourselves as the
decarbonization and efficiency leader in fossil fuels, which we underlined with our latest project
wins such as the santo domingo floating power plant, which is a hybrid power plant solution
with integrated battery energy storage providing 145 mw of flexible power generation or the
hybridization project with a german ipp combining battery storage systems and industrial gas
turbines with the capability to switch from gas to hydrogen and show readiness for
transformationto100%hydrogenfiring.
in combining all decarbonization levers – efficiency increase, hybridization and deep
decarbonization – we develop future proof energy systems via co-creation, resulting in an
individualized decarbonization roadmap based on the customer’s current fleet and
decarbonization targets. the implementation steps of such roadmaps are a combination of
available technologies, like heat pumps or hydrogen-ready gas turbines, as well as technologies
in development. a special focus is on the integration of renewables, hybridization, and energy
storage combined in customer specific optimal system designs for power generation producers
and energy intensive industrial verticals. nevertheless for the transition phase also a coal to gas
shift can increase the efficiency up to 25 percentage points (source: storm, 2017) and reduce co

(cid:129) growth–inthefiscalyear2019,approximately60%ofthedivision’stotalnewunitandservice
revenue was attributable to service (including intercompany service business) and was driven
by its installed base of more than 79,000 units, which we plan to further leverage to grow our
business.theservicebusinessformstheindustrial applicationdivision’s financialbackboneand
contributed 70% to its order backlog of € 10 billion as of june 30, 2020. this is the result of
long-lasting customer partnerships with oil &gasoperators, suchasinternational,nationaland
independent oil companies, and customers within industries such as marine, chemical, fiber,
metallurgy, and air separation. we also provide services for oil & gas and distributed
generation customers, including other industries such as food and beverages, minerals and
metals,industrialparksandmunicipalities,amongothers.
our orders in the fiscal year 2019 can be grouped in orders from our upstream (approximately
30%), midstream (approximately 20%) and process industries business (includes downstream
business (approximately 15%) as well as orders from industrial customers (approximately
35%)), addressing both the new units business and our service relevant rotating equipment
installed base of approximately 7,000 units in the upstream as well as midstream business,
approximately 25,000 in the downstream business and approximately 40,000 in the industries
business. based on our average orders over the fiscal years 2017 to 2019, we received orders
from more than 5,000 customers and thereof more than 20% from fifteen customers. the

integratedsystemsandsolutionofferings.
12.3.3.1.1 compressors
our industrial applications division offers an extensive portfolio of compressors with different
technical designs suited for a wide range of applications for many different process industries,
includingtheoil&gasindustry.suchapplicationscomprise,amongothers:
(cid:129) upstream production – our industrial applications division’s compressors are used for gas lift
(i.e., lifting of fluids by introducing high-pressure gas), boil-off / residue gas, export, natural
gas gathering, natural gas liquids, shale, coal bed methane and enhanced oil recovery by
injection of natural gas into an oil field to increase pressure, floating production storage and
offloadingunits(fpso)andfloatingliquefiedgas(“flng”)operations.
(cid:129) midstream segment of the oil & gas industry – our industrial applications division’s
compressors are used for applications such as gas transportation and storage, on- and offshore
lngandfuelgasandnaturalgasprocessing.
(cid:129) downstream processing, process and other industries – our industrial applications division’s
compressors are used for gas-to-liquids processes in petrochemical plants, hydrogen
production, various other refining applications, methanol and ethylene, ammonia, nitric acid,
andurea,aswellasfor,e.g.,airseparation,fertilizers, metallurgy,carbon-captureandstorage,
compressedairenergystorageandpowergenerationapplications(suchasfuelgas).
ourindustrial applicationsdivision’s compressorsareengineered-to-orderorconfigured-to-order
according to customer needs, in particular due to the specific requirements for different gas
compositions.
turbo compressors come in different technical designs based on gas composition, flow rate, inlet
andoutletpressurerequirements.technicaldesignsofturbocompressorsrangefromsingle-shaft
centrifugal compressors, over pipeline centrifugal compressors, axial compressors, integrally
geared centrifugal compressors to single-stage compressors and gas expander. our industrial
applications division’s turbo compressors are generally sold as an integrated system together
with a driver turbine or motor serving as a train, including auxiliary systems such as oil and
controlsystemsonajointorindividualbaseframe.
the technical design of reciprocating compressors is based on positive displacement of gas
through pistons. our industrial applications division’s reciprocating compressors are often
individuallysuppliedtotier-onesupplierscombiningtheseintotheoveralltrainsystem.
12.3.3.1.2 gasturbines
with its industrial and aero-derivative gas turbines, industrial applications addresses a wide
variety of market segments along almost the entire value chain of the oil & gas industry and
process industries. based on robust and flexible design, they are applied as mechanical drive for
compressors and pumps or for power generation and co-generation applications. turbines are a
type of internal combustion engine in which the burning of a fuel or air-fuel mixture produces
hot gases that spin a turbine to produce power or compressors and pumps to move hydrocarbon
gases and fluids. our turbine portfolio covers industrial gas turbines and aero-derivative gas
turbines.
(1) industrialgasturbines
our industrial gas turbines are characterized by their compact and rugged design for process
industries such as the oil & gas, petrochemical, chemical, cement, metals and mining, fiber (pulp
and paper), construction and infrastructure as well as other manufacturing industries. industrial
301
gas turbines are commonly used for mechanical drive applications such as driving compressors or
pumps. therefore, in many cases industrial gasturbines aresold asatrain packagetogetherwith
a compressor or a pump. in addition, industrial gas turbines are used for on-site captive power
and co-generation. they deliver power outputs ranging from 5 mw to 62.5 mw. the hydrogen
co-firing capabilities of our smaller sized industrial gas turbines delivering power outputs from 5
mw to 15 mw range from 10% to 30%. for more details regarding industrial gas turbines
deliveringpoweroutputsfrom24.5mwto62.5mw,see“12.3.2.1.1(2)industrialgasturbines”.
(2) aero-derivativegasturbines
the technical design of aero-derivative gas turbines is based on turbine designs used in aviation.
due to this technical background, aero-derivative turbines are used for applications that require
flexible, compact and lightweight equipment, such as applications in the onshore and offshore
oil & gas industry (e.g., lng, onshore and offshore production and pipelines). when compared
with industrial gas turbines, aero-derivative gas turbines also have significantly faster start-up
times. presently, we offer aero-derivative gas turbines that deliver power outputs from 4 mw to
71 mw. however, in the pursuit of higher profitability, we re-assessed our portfolio of aero-
derivative gas turbines and made a strategic portfolio decision to streamline our offering. while
we will continue to service all types of our aero-derivative gas turbines and still deliver all aero-
derivative gas turbines that have already been ordered, we will over time no longer actively
market our larger sized aero-derivative gas turbines (see also “9.4.10.3 special items” and also
“9.7.2.13adjustedebitaandadjustedebitabeforespecialitems”).
12.3.3.1.3 subseaproducts
for subsea applications, our product portfolio includes wet mate connectors and sensors (for our
subseasolutions,see“12.3.3.3.9subseapowergridsolutions”below).
wet mate connectors are used to distribute power and communication signals from the main
umbilical or power cable to diverse equipment such as the so-called “christmas trees” (which are
assemblies of valves and other components used to control the flow of an oil or gas well),
manifolds (which are a type of flow routers) control modules or subsea processing equipment
like pumps or compressors on the seabed. our product range of wet mate connectors includes
low-voltage(“lv”),ethernet,optical/fiberandmedium-voltage(“mv”)connectorsupto45kv.
sensors are used on subsea structures, such as so-called “christmas trees” and manifolds, to
measure pressure and temperature in the fluid flow from a production well, orareusedin single

our industrial applications division’s portfolio includes integrated systems for unconventional
production, energy storage, energy generation and heat-to-power systems that extend our
product offerings. where other products and services are required for its integrated systems
offerings, these are sourced either from other divisions of siemens energy (e.g., medium
industrial gas turbines and steam turbines are sourced from our generation division), from
siemens,orfromotherthird-partyproviders.
12.3.3.2.1 siemenselectricalandmechanical(seam)
with our siemens electrical and mechanical (“seam”) portfolio, our industrial applications
division provides electric and mechanical solutions for in-field unconventional oil & gas activities,
including drilling, exploration of shale gas and enhanced oil recovery. these solutions allow its

12.3.3.3.9 subseapowergridsolutions
our industrial applications division offers comprehensive subsea power grid solutions. we
believe that subsea power distribution can transform the way offshore oil and gas fields are
developed, especially by connecting remote satellite fields to existing installations (so-called
“long tiebacks”), and for marginal and dispersed fields, by extending tieback ranges and
substantially reducing cabling costs. our subsea power grid solution is a mega-volt power
distributionsolutionsuitableforwaterdepthsdownto3,000meters(approximately10,000feet).
the grid consists of a subsea transformer, subsea switchgear, a subsea variable speed drive
(“vsd”), which is used to drive pumps, subsea wet mate connectors (see also “12.3.3.1.3 subsea
products” above), and a remote control, monitoring and power management system that
includes cloud-based user dashboards and data analytics. by moving heavy, space-consuming
power equipment like vsds and pumps and compressors to the seafloor, our subsea power grid
solution allows operators and epcs to implement more flexible designs. the subsea power grid
also has environmental benefits as it improves the economics of tying into onshore power grids
orusingrenewableenergyfromoffshorewindpowerplants.
other solutions include power solutions for subsea pipeline heating systems using our direct
electrical heating (deh) or electrical trace heating (eth) technologies as a flow assurance
measure to control or remove hydrate formation in subsea pipelines. subsea digigrid is a

12.3.4.1 newenergybusiness
our new energy business complements our portfolio by driving new technologies in the field of
decarbonization. the current focus of the new energy business is to enable the green hydrogen
economy and to drive decarbonization with “power-to-x” solutions. we believe that hydrogen is
at the core of an entirely new energy business, as it is expected to foster sector coupling (see
“11.1.3.2.2 decarbonization”). our new energy business currently offers electrolyzer systems for
the production of green hydrogen, which can be used to produce, e.g., synthetic fuels and other
chemicals. these are integrated into the energy value chain, where they connect with several
products andservices providedbyourotherdivisions withinthegasandpowersegment.various
lighthouse projects have proven the technical feasibility and industrial scalability of our
electrolyzer-based solutions in several multi-mw plants and large-scale commercialization is
expected in the near future. in august 2020, we signed an agreement to provide a customized
hydrogen production system for a hydrogen fueling station in beijing. the megawatt green
hydrogen production solution features our silyzer 200 electrolyzer system and is the first of its
kind to be built by us in china. it is expected to be delivered in 2021. the project is part of a
broader cooperation in green hydrogen development between siemens energy and spic (for
information on the cooperation with spic in other business fields, see “12.3.2.1.1(4)
collaborationwithstatepowerinvestmentcorporationlimitedofchina”).
our new energy business is currently in the start-up phase; consequently, the customers so far
consist mainly of users of pilot plants. the future customer structure will depend on the further
311
development and penetration of this new market. in particular, the extent and implementation
of sector coupling will have an impact on future customers in other economic sectors. given the
start-up nature of our new energy business, we are not expecting a positive profit contribution
fromtheseactivitiesinthecomingyears.
12.3.4.1.1 systems
due to high flexibility of design, our electrolyzer systems can be tailored to the specific needs of
its customers. they feature modular designs and are available for various fields of application.
we have carried out projects based on two large-scale electrolyzer systems so far: the silyzer 200
and the silyzer 300. the silyzer 200 system consists of 1.25 mw stacks including the necessary
process technology which produces approximately 20.5 kg of hydrogen per hour with a system
efficiency of around 65%. multiple stacks can be combined into a pem electrolysis system in a
higher performance class. the scope includes an optional cooling system, water treatment
system, power grid connection and more. currently, our new energy business offers the latest
silyzer 300 system as our most powerful product line with peak performance in the double-digit
megawatt range, which allows for the efficient scaling to minimize overall investment costs in
large-scale industrial electrolysis plants. we believe that the silyzer 300 produces hydrogen at
competitive costs with a system efficiency of up to 75%. its hydrogen production output can
rangefrom100to2,000kgofhydrogenperhour.
12.3.4.1.2 solutions
to operate electrolyzer systems as part of the energy value chain, they must be integrated
efficiently. this is where our solutions business can provide customized combinations along the
entire value chain. to produce green electricity, the sgre segment can provide its wind turbine
products. to connect the renewable power to the electrolyzer, the transmission division has
various products (e.g., transformers, switchgear, and rectifiers) as well as solutions for grid
connection and grid management. to compress the hydrogen that our electrolyzers produce, the
industrial applications division has products and solutions available. over the coming years, we
aim to expand into “power-to-x” solutions (e.g., power-to-fuels) based on our portfolio of
productsandsystems.
12.3.4.1.3 services
new energy business provides several services for electrolyzers. services range from basic
maintenance and troubleshooting activities on demand over advanced services, such as
preventive maintenance, remote service and condition monitoring, to integrated comprehensive
serviceusingstate-of-the-artdataanalysisbasedonaperformance-basedmaintenancecontract.
new energy business plans to provide digital services and consulting to help customers on
decarbonization solutions based on the domain expertise, techno-economic modelling and
optimization, global footprint and local experts, with the focus on hydrogen and “power-to-x”
solutions.
based on our industry knowledge, long-standing expertise in the management of large-scale and
complex projects, global footprint and network of experts, we believe that our new energy
business is in a strong position to drive our customers’ decarbonization projects, with the focus
onhydrogenand“power-to-x”solutions.

12.3.11.6 awards
over the years, our gas and power segment has won many awards recognizing the results our
r&d efforts deliver. recent examples include, the spotlight on new technology award 2019 of
the offshore technology conference for its bluevault energy storage solution, which is a
lithium-ion battery-based energy storage solution suited for both all-electric and hybrid (e.g.,

power grid for subsea power distribution in large depths. in 2015, it received the german
renewables award in the category “product innovation of the year” for the silyzer electrolysis
systemforhydrogenproduction.
12.3.12 iprights
ip is an essential part of our gas and power segment’s business and ip assets are, in the
aggregate, of material importance. however, we believe that no single ip asset is material to its
business as a whole, except for its right to use the trademark name, “siemens energy”. we
believe our gas and power segment’s ip portfolio is a competitive advantage for the business
and, accordingly, our gas and power segment devotes significant resources to develop, protect,
defend,andexploititsipassets.
our gas and power segment’s patent portfolio is predominantly based on employee inventions
fromourr&defforts.theiporganizationhasofficesingermany,theunitedstates,greatbritain
and china and each office is located in close proximity to its primary r&d sites, which are based
in berlin, düsseldorf, erlangen, munich, orlando (us) and beijing. as of june 30, 2020, our gas
and power segment held about 18,400 single patents and utility models in approximately 5,200
patent families, including approximately 12,600 granted patents or registered utility models,
globally. in addition, it currently maintains, protects, and owns approximately 2,000 marks,
includingapproximately1,800registeredtrademarks.
our gas and power segment has defined and implemented dedicated ip strategies for each
business. its divisions are supported by experienced ip organization of patent professionals
specialized in energy ip matters. key elements of its ip framework strategy include generating

clustersofiprightsaddressingdifferentaspectsofselecteduniquesellingpointfeatures.ourgas
and power segment actively manages its ip portfolio to maintain and enhance its technological
positionandcompetitiveadvantageaswellastocreatebusinessopportunitiesfromip.
in recent years, our gas and power segment has been pursuing a more selective strategy when
filing for new patents, which is aimed at reducing costs while at the same time adequately
protecting its innovations. as a result, the average number of new filings decreased from
approximately 780 in the fiscal year 2017 to approximately 530 in the fiscal year 2019. this
decrease was mainly driven by a reduction in patent filings for inventions related to rotating
equipment which decreased from approximately 320 in the fiscal year 2017 to approximately 100
inthefiscalyear2019.
generally, our gas and power segment’s ip strategy is based on three pillars: protect, defend and
exploit.
(cid:129) protect – it protects its ip rights by, among other things, filing new patents, utility models,
designs,trademarks,copyrightsandregisteringdomainswithappropriateregionalcoverage.
(cid:129) defend – it monitors third-party ip rights and takes appropriate countermeasures to defend
against allegations of infringing on third-party ip rights. such countermeasures include
invalidation actions, implementing alternative solutions, or seeking to obtain a license. in the
fiscal year 2019, the gas and power segment filed 45 objections against third party patents. in
addition, it entered into license agreements regarding third-party ip rights from selected
companies and universities, as well as from the siemens group to support our current and
futurebusinesses (see,also“18.1.1.1.4trademarkandnameuse(sub-)license agreementwith
siemensenergy”).
(cid:129) exploit – it makes its ip visible in tenders and contracts, particularly whenthereis afocus onits
patentsandtheunderlyingprotectedtechnology.furthermore,byactivelylicensingitspatents
it tries to generate additional value for its business. for example, it generates additional
incomefromthelicensingofitspatents.
we have applied to register our brand “siemens energy” in more than 100 countries
worldwide. several hundred product names are registered as trademarks in numerous countries.
among them are several marks with a longstanding tradition in the business such as benson,
trafo-union,geafolorelin.
12.3.13 insurance
our gas and power segment’s current insurance coverage is provided under the siemens global
insurance policies until september 30, 2021 and in amounts that we believe are consistent with
customary industry practices in its businesses and for its business operations, including insurance
for property damage, business interruption and construction coverage,generalliability insurance
(including products, operations and services liability), marine and cyber insurance. following the
expiry of its insurance coverage under the siemens global insurance policies, our gas and power
segment intends to enter into new global policies substantially similar to the previous insurance
policies, giving due consideration to the size and risk profile of its business and the volumes
available in the insurance market at reasonable economic conditions. accordingly, no assurance
can be given that our gas and power segment will be able to obtain insurance coverage that has
a comparable scope at similar costs. the directors and officers liability insurance (“d&o
insurance”) and other financial lines programs (e.g., employment practices liability, crime
insurance and criminal legal defense cost insurance) will be replaced by its own policies at the
latestuponspin-offcompletion.
12.4 sgre segment
our sgre segment is a leading global supplier of wind power solutions to customers all over the
world and had the second highest installed capacity (in gw) of wind turbines worldwide as of
the end of 2019 (source: wood mackenzie 2019 market share report, database of historical
capacityinstallations).
323
with almost 40 years of experience in the wind power business, sgre designs, develops,
manufactures, sells, installs and maintains both onshore and offshore wind turbines. sgre offers,
in its own assessment, one of the broadest product portfolios in the industry as well as industry-
leadingservicesolutions,helpingtomakecleanenergymoreaffordableandreliable.
sgre s.a. is headquartered in spain. our sgre segment generated € 10.2 billion in total
revenuesinthefiscalyearendedseptember30,2019(fiscalyear2019).itsorderbacklogstoodat

the activities of our sgre segment are organized in two main businesses: (i) wind turbines,
which consists of the business units onshore wind power and offshore wind power (also
referred to as “onshore” and “offshore”, respectively), and (ii) operation and maintenance
(service). as of june 30, 2020, 46.9% (or € 15 billion) of the order backlog related to the sgre
segment’s service activities, which have higher profitability and have expandedconsiderably over
the past few years, driven by a higher installed base (e.g., an increase by 9.1% in the fiscal year
2019 compared to the fiscal year 2018). in addition, in the context of energy transition trends,
the sgre segment explores opportunities in adjacent renewable business fields. the sgre
segment’s wind turbine and service portfolio creates value reducing the levelized cost of energy
(lcoe), contributing to long-term returns for customers and to the development of the industry.
there is more than 100 gw of installed capacity of sgre wind turbines spread across the globe
delivering more than 260 mt ghg savings per year in more than 70 countries and a fleet of
approximately 72 gw under maintenance (including the integration of the fleet acquired in the
senvionacquisition),ineachcaseasofjune30,2020.
sgre has a leading product and service platform in place to benefit from the favorable outlook
for the wind energy market. as described in our industry section (see “11.5.3.2 new unit market

market update: q2 2020”, june 2020, and 2019 o&m reports, including related data sets) and
sgre has a very strong competitive and profitable position in both of them. in offshore, sgre is
the market leader (both in terms of new capacity additions in 2019 as well as of the offshore
turbine installed base, according to wood mackenzie data; see “11.5.4.2 competitive
environment in the offshore new unit market segment”) with unparalleled track-record with

at the same time, the onshore new unit market segment is expected to remain the largest wind
market segment in the coming years (see “11.5.3.1 new unit market segment – onshore” for
more information). sgre also has a leading product platform in this sector, with 89 gw installed
and with an onshore order backlog of € 7 billion as of june 30, 2020. in general, profitability in
the onshore sector has significantly decreased in recent years due to the introduction of auctions
and tensions in the supply chain (e.g., so-called trade wars and the recent impact of the
covid-19 pandemic, among others). additionally, our sgre segment has been recently
negatively affected in its onshore business by cost overruns in some projects and also by the
structuralchallengesintheindianmarket,wheresgrehasaleadingposition.
our sgre segment aims for value creation by improving the profitability in onshore activities
through a dedicated turn-around effort and capturing the growth potential of the offshore and
services sector while maintaining profitability. furthermore, our sgre segment has set a clear
priority on profit over volume, in particular in onshore, as well as strong focus on cash
generation. with significant progress made already in recent years, our sgre segment remains

12.4.1 productsandservices
the core business portfolio of our sgre segment comprises wind turbines for onshore and
offshore wind power plants as well as a wide range of services. these business lines allow sgre
325
to be present across the wind value chain, by offering a wide range of products and services for
different project types and site conditions. innovation is a key driver in the wind energy sector.
sgre believes it is at the forefront of technological development and innovation, and that it has
one of the most comprehensive wind turbine and service portfolios in the sector, enabling it to
minimize the lcoe (for more information on lcoe, see “11.5.2.5 cost trends”) and to provide
optimalreturnsforitscustomers.
the sgre segment’s wind turbines business generated total revenue in the amount of
€ 8.6 billion (or 84% of the sgre segment’s total revenue) in the fiscal year 2019, thereof
€ 5.2 billion attributable to the onshore business unit and € 3.4 billion to the offshore business
unit. sgre’s service business generated total revenue in the amount of € 1,617 million (or 15.8%
of the sgre segment’s total revenue), in the fiscal year 2019. during the fiscal year 2019, our
sgre segment received orders amounting to € 12.7 billion (as stated in the “orders” line item
corresponding to sgre in note 24 to the combined financial statements). from those orders,
€ 10.0 billion related to wind turbines (thereof € 6.9 billion in onshore and € 3.1 billion in
offshore)and€2.7billiontoservice.
our sgre segment develops and manufactures wind turbines which are suitable for a broad
range of wind speeds (low, medium and high wind) and a full spectrum of weather conditions,
and which are capable of fulfilling specific local requirements. every wind generation location
presents specific challenges, which require the choice of the most appropriate product. to meet
the specific needs of its customers, sgre offers versatile solutions for onshore and offshore
powerplants.
according to its “one segment, one technology” strategy, sgre uses mainly geared technology
for onshore and direct drive technology for offshore wind turbines. in the direct drive
technology, a low-speed permanent magnet replaces the gearbox, the coupling and the high-
speed generator, combining simplicity with a high level of efficiency (see also “12.4.1.3 offshore
windturbines”).
with wind turbines installed in more than 70 countries worldwide, having a total capacity of
more than 100 gw as of june 30, 2020, and a full range of product platforms, sgre sees itself as
one of the main global technological leaders in the multi-megawatt wind turbine segment. our
sgre segment had wind turbines with over 1 gw installed in each of the following 16 countries
as of september 30, 2019 (based on cumulative installed capacity figures, including all sgre
onshore and offshore wind turbines for each country): united states, spain, united kingdom,
germany,india,china,brazil,canada,mexico,italy, denmark,france,sweden,turkeyegyptand
poland.
offshore projects are typically significantly larger in size than onshore projects. for example, one
recent reference offshore project is hornsea one in the united kingdom, the world’s largest
offshore wind power plant commissioned to date (source: ørsted’s website for the project,
hornseaprojectone.co.uk,section“abouttheproject”),inwhich174sgreoffshoreturbineswere
installed. with a total capacity of 1.2 gw, the plant can power over 1 million homes. in addition,
injune2020,sgreconditionallyreceivedanorderfor100unitsofitsnewsg14-222ddoffshore
wind turbineforinnogy’s1.4gwsofiaoffshorewindpowerplantintheunitedkingdom.when
completed, the project will have the capacity to generate enough electricity to power more than
1.2 million british households (source: power technology website, information on sofia offshore
wind project, available from https://www.power-technology.com/projects/sofia-offshore-wind-
farm/).
for the onshore business, reference projects include a landmark order for 35 units of its new sg
5.8-155 turbine (the most powerful geared onshore wind turbine so far, according to sgre) for
the 231 mw skaftåsen project in sweden. the turbines will be installed with flexible power
rating operating at 6.6 mw, and they will be covered by a 30-year full-service agreement. the
first of the 35 units is expected to be installed in the second quarter of 2021. in 2020, sgre
received additional orders for the sg 5.8-170 variant of its 5.x onshore platform for further
projectsinswedenandinothercountrieslikebrazil.

inaddition,oursgresegmenthasatrackrecordofexcellenceinoperationandmaintenance(for
more details, see “12.4.1.4 services”). leveraging scale and global reach, and also capitalizing on
its extensive fleet of installed wind turbines, sgre offers a flexible service portfolio that can be
tailored to its customers’ diverse operating models. sgre also provides advanced diagnostics and
digitalization capabilities, as well as customized offshore services. recently, sgre was able to
extend the service agreement for the 288 mw meerwind project off the german northern sea
coast for an additional seven and a half years, with an option for a further three-year extension
period. moreover, in 2020, sgre signed a 20-year service agreement and another 30-year service
agreement for senvion turbines for two wind projects in australia with a combined capacity
ratingofapproximately360mw.
12.4.1.1 overviewofwindclassclassification
the characteristics of the wind turbines in sgre’s portfolio vary depending on the type of
location for which they are designed. the industry uses a classification of wind classes that
focuses on aspects such as wind speed (both maximum and average wind speeds at a certain
location are considered), extreme gusts and turbulence. the international electrotechnical
commission (“iec”) sets international standards for the wind speeds each wind class must
withstand; the latest version is contained in “iec 61400 – edition 4” (2019). the iec wind
classification goes from class iec i (high wind), over iec ii (medium wind) to iec iii (low wind). in
addition, wind class “s” refers to parameters that are user-defined and/or location-specific, while
wind class “t” is used for tropical cyclone classes (typhoon, hurricane and cyclone). in addition,
the suffix “a”, “b” or “c” used after the roman number corresponding to a wind class refers to
the categories of higher, medium and lower turbulence intensity characteristics, respectively.
some of the iec standards provide technical conditions verifiable by an independent, third party
and as such are necessary in order to enter into agreements relating to financing and erection of
wind turbines. in certain countries, like in the united states for offshore wind turbines, the
fulfillmentoffurtherstandardsmayberequired.

sg 3.4-145 turbine is already being commercialized and is expected to begin commercial
production in sgre’s facilities in india starting in early 2021. the sg 3.4-145 wind turbine has
been designed to comply with the global iecre standards and meets the indian cea 2019
requirements.
12.4.1.2.3 siemensgamesa4.xplatform
the sgre 4.x platform is one of the latest additions to the sgre product portfolio, designed to
deliver an outstanding lcoe for turbines with nominal power ratings in the 4 mw segment. due
to the modularity and flexibility of these turbines, they are suitable for a variety of sites. sgre’s
4.xplatform incorporates proventechnologies,significantly minimizing technologicalrisks, while
alsointegratinginnovativetechnologiestoachievehigherefficiencyandcost-effectiveness.
sg5.0-132and5.0-145
the sgre 4.x platform consists of the sg 5.0-145 and the sg 5.0-132 wind turbines, two
benchmark solutions in the market for sites with medium and high winds. with a new control
system, enhanced blade aerodynamics and structural modularity, both the sg 5.0-145 and sg
5.0-132 wind turbines offer sgre’s customers higher flexibility to adapt to sites with a wide
rangeofwind conditions andlogistics constraints. sgre’s4.xplatformusesprovenconceptswith
extensive track record in the market, such as the combination of a three-stage gearbox (two
planetary and one parallel) and a doubly-fed induction generator, offering high levels of
reliability. in addition to this, the inclusion of an optional premium converter allows sgre’s 4.x
wind turbines to meet demanding grid connection requirements. the new 71-meter and
64.5-meter blades, made of fiberglass reinforced with epoxy resin, integrate innovative
aerodynamics. the dinotails® next generation technology enables a balance between high
energy production and reduced noise emission levels. sgre’s 4.x platform introduces a new
control system to optimize the efficiency of the wind turbines and their applicability in a wide
range of sites. it also offers flexible power rating, depending on the noise requirements,
temperature and electrical properties of the project. the sg 5.0-145 and sg5.0-132models allow
for an increase in annual energy production (“aep”) of more than 30% compared to previous
solutionsfromthesgre3.xplatform.
12.4.1.2.4 siemensgamesa5.xplatform
the sgre 5.x platform achieves new parameters in terms of performance, cost-efficiency and
reliability: in power output, with 5.8 mw and a rotor size of 155 and 170 meters, depending on
the variant, for a highly competitive lcoe; in technology, based on sgre’s know-how and
expertise; in versatility, with a highly flexible design for logistics, construction and service; in site
adaptability, to configure the optimal solution for each project and, ultimately, in value for
sgre’s customers. sgre’s 5.x platform was announced in april 2019 and is not yet in serial
production. sgre expects that first prototypes of the turbine models of this platform will be
availabletowardstheendof2020.
sg5.8-155andsg5.8-170
the sg 5.8-155 and sg 5.8-170 wind turbines include a doubly-fed generator and partial
converter combination, a compact drive train design with a three-stage gearbox, and the use of
components widely validated on the other sgre platforms. the result is a wind turbine design
that delivers optimum performance and lcoe. sgre’s 5.x platform is a new generation platform
with a high unitary power rating of 5.8 mw combined with two of the largest rotor diameters
currently in the market, 155 and 170 meters (depending on the variant), resulting in maximum
performanceinhigh-,medium-andlow-windconditions.
the sg 5.8-155 and sg 5.8-170 turbines allow for a higher aep per wind turbine and optimized
capital expenditures for wind projects compared to previous generations. this is also duetotheir
versatility, a modular, flexible design for maximum ease of logistics, construction and o&m,
reducingtheoperationalexpenditure,whichresultsinalowerlcoeforprojects.

the sgre 5.x platform focuses on enhancing profitability as a key factor in generating value for
sgre’s customers. contributing factors to profitability include (i) a flexible, personalized
configuration of power modes fully tailored to the needs of each site, (ii) an extensive catalog of
towers with multiple available technologies and the additional capability to create specific
project designs, (iii) the use of advanced control strategies that enable intelligent load reduction
andagreaterapplicability for thesgre5.xplatformindifferentwindconditions,(iv) amodular,
optimized structure for local transport and construction conditions, (iv) a maintainability-
oriented design with advanced diagnostics and remote operation solutions, as well as the
possibility of replacing main components without requiring a crane, and (v) optional product
solutionstocoveralltypesofmarketrequirements.
sgre has already secured orders for the 5.x platform, for example for projects in sweden and in
brazil(see“12.4.1productsandservices”).
12.4.1.2.5 legacyonshorewindturbines
certain onshore products from the former siemens wind power and gamesa portfolios are still
available for selected projects. sgre’s legacy portfolio includes, among others, the following
wind turbines (which are based on the direct drive technology): the swt-dd-120 and the
swt-dd-130 turbines, both with a nominal power from 3.9 to 4.3 mw and a rotor length of 120
meters and 130 meters, respectively, as well as the swt-dd-142 model, with a nominal power
rangingfrom3.5mwto4.1mwand142-meterrotorlength.
12.4.1.3 offshorewindturbines
sgre’soffshoreapproachisfocusedondirectdrivetechnology(asopposedtogearedtechnology
for the onshore products), which is particularly suitable for offshore conditions. replacing the
gearbox, main shaft and a conventional high-speed generator with a low-speed generator
eliminates two-thirds of the conventional drive train arrangement. as a result, the number of
rotating and wear-prone parts is vastly reduced, so that a sgre direct drive wind turbine has
50%fewer movingparts thanacomparablegearedmachine.thesimplistic designalsotranslates
into lower weights. furthermore, it reduces the likelihood of failures, and the use of fewer
moving parts in the direct drive technology (compared to geared machines) also means fewer
sparepartsareneededoverthecourseofawindpowerplant’slifetime.

sgre ventured into offshore as a pioneer in 1991, installing the first commercial offshore wind
power plant (vindeby project) off the coast of denmark. as of september 30, 2019, sgre had
331
installed offshore wind turbines with a total capacity of approximately 15 gw worldwide as well
asanoffshoreorderbacklogof€7billion.
swt-6.0-154
the swt-6.0-154 has a 6 mw output and a swept area of 18,600 square meters, making it an
ideal offshore solution. the drive train design has evolved from an onshore 3 mw direct drive
design with enhanced electrical components and upgraded magnets adapting it to the harsh
offshore wind environment. this turbine comes with a 154-meter rotor and 75-meter blades, and
has been designed for class i or s sites, i.e., for high-wind and high-turbulence offshore
environmentswherereliabilitymattersmost.
swt-7.0-154
with high-energy production and assured reliability, the swt-7.0-154 is a class i/s design with an
increased mw rating. it features small upgrades in the electrical components (converter,
transformer) and magnets compared to the proven 6 mw technology. staying within the
swt-6.0-154 design envelope, the 7 mw variant offers various advantages: a shorter certification
process, re-use of equipment and tools, known manufacturing and installation processes as well
asminimalbalance-of-plantsupplychainimpactfromturbineconfiguration.

power- and grid performance. by introducing a larger rotor (with a diameter of 167 meters)
using the new aerodynamic 81.4-meter-long b81 blades, the sg 8.0-167 dd is able to yield up to
20% higher aep than the 7 mw direct drive turbine. the fact that – with the exception of the
blades,whicharenowlonger–sgreutilizescomponentsthatarealreadyinplayinothermodels
alsomeansoperatingwithanestablishedsupplychainandestablished,standardizedprocesses.it
also reduces product risks and enables the manufacturing of high volumes and a fast
time-to-market. this wind turbine is available in different variants, including typhoon wind class
and a high temperature package to cater to varying regional market conditions. the production
start of the sg 8.0-167dd was in the european autumn of 2019 – by which time over 1,000 units
of the direct drive offshore turbine family had been installed since such direct drive offshore
turbineswerelaunchedin2011.
sg11.0-200dd
the new sg 11.200 dd was publicly presented in february 2020 and is scheduled for serial
production in 2022. the 11 mw rating is made possible through a larger generator diameter,
reusing the proven direct drive generator technology. by increasing the rotor diameter to an
impressive 200meterswith97-meter-longblades,thesg11.0-200ddoffersupto40%moreaep
than the sg 8.0-167 dd under similar conditions. the most significant change compared to
previous models is the introduction of carbon in the blade, which was first introduced in the
onshore blade portfolio, to achieve lighter and stiffer blades. the rest of the components are
tried and tested over generations of offshore turbines, including the direct drive technology,
“integralblade” technology, tower concepts, as well as maintenance and safety systems. features
suchas“highwindridethrough”andthepowerboostfunction enabletheturbinetomaintain
an industry leading availability. again, building the new turbine based on the experience of
previous turbine generations allows sgre to improve profitability and reduce risk for its
customers.itisdesignedforhigh-windclasses(i,s).
in june 2020, sgre received a firm order for 140 sg 11.0-200 dd wind turbines for the subsidy-
free projects hollandse kust zuid i to iv off the netherlands. the project will feature nearly 1.5
332
gw of installed power and is expected to be commissioned in 2023. the new sg 11.0-200 dd
offshore wind turbine is also planned to be deployed, for example, in two offshore projects,
borkum riffgrund 3 and gode wind 3 (which is still subject to certain conditions), in the german
north sea totaling 1,142 gw (for more information, see the introduction under “12.4.1 products
andservices”).
sg14-222dd
in may 2020, sgre announced the sg 14-222 dd offshore wind turbine, released with a
nameplate capacity of 14 mw, but which can reach 15 mw with a “power boost” option. this
new wind turbine is designed with a 222-meter rotor diameter and massive 108-meter long
blades, and particularly for wind class i, s. according to sgre’s calculations, this new turbine
would avoid approximately 1.4 million tons of co emissions per machine over the turbine’s
2
projected25-yearlifetime.thesg14-222turbineoffersover25%moreaepthanthesg11.0-200
dd offshore wind turbine under similar conditions. it is designed with a light 500-ton nacelle
weight that enables optimized substructure at lower cost. sgre plans to have a first prototype
ready in 2021 and currently expects that this turbine will be commercially available in 2024. for
example, in late may 2020, sgre’s new sg 14-222 dd offshore wind turbine was selected to be
used at the upcoming 300 mw hai long 2 project. the deployment of the turbine for the rest of
the 1,044 mw hai long pipeline is also being considered. the exact number of units for the first
300 mw of the project remains to be confirmed based on site-specific conditions, and the
preferred supplier agreement remains subject to certain conditions (for more information, see
the introduction under “12.4.1 products and services”). in may 2020, sgre was named as the
preferredturbinesuppliertosupplyitssg14-222directdriveoffshorewindturbinestothe2,640
mw dominion energy coastal virginia offshore wind (“cvow”) project, the largest offshore
project to-date in the united states (according to dominion energy’s website section regarding
the cvow project), with turbine installations expected to be completed by 2026. decisions on
sourcing and supply chain to serve the u.s. market are expected to be made within 2021. in
addition, in june 2020, sgre conditionally received an order for 100 units of this new
sg 14-222 dd offshore wind turbine for innogy’s 1.4 gw sofia offshore wind power plant in the
unitedkingdom,amongotherprojects.
12.4.1.4 services
the service business of our sgre segment is responsible for the management, monitoring and
maintenance of wind power plants. as of june 30, 2020, sgre reported a service order backlog
of € 15 billion. the average duration of the order book is approximately nine years (as of
june 30, 2020). our sgre segment had roughly 32,000 serviced turbines worldwide, with more
than 72 gw under maintenance (including approximately 11 gw from the offshore fleet under
maintenance and approximately 61 gw relating to the onshore fleet under maintenance, which
includes the fleet acquired in connection with the senvion acquisition) as of june 30, 2020. sgre
currently delivers high-quality o&m services with a global reach and has service operations in
more than 60 countries around the world through its five regional and two global competence
centers.
sgre’s service business unit supports its customers’ business models in multiple ways. these
include maximizing sgre’s customers’ wind power plant revenue through efficient maintenance
and repair solutions, mitigating customers’ financial and business risk through sgre’s
performance and component warranties, or increasing the energy production and thus the
return on investment of customers’ wind power plants through performance upgrades and
lifetime extensions. in addition, byprovidinginnovativeoffshorelogistics forfar-shoresiteaccess
or combining its intelligent analytics with unique domain know-how into knowledge products,
sgreaimstodeliveranoptimizedmaintenancestrategyforawiderangeofcustomers.
our sgre segment’s services can be tailored, depending on the customer’s specific operational
needs. these range from models under which experienced customers assume part of the risk,
over comprehensive services that include service from upgrades and expert analysis, to asset
management,whereoursgresegmentmanagesawindpowerplantforthecustomer.
333
our sgre segment capitalizes on its own extensive fleet of installed wind turbines (89 gw
onshore and 16 gw offshore as of june 30, 2020), most of which, in particular in the years
following installation and in many cases based on long-term agreements, is being serviced by
sgre based on long term agreements with contract durations up to 30 years. in addition, sgre
strives to increase its share of service of third-party turbine fleets, pursuing service contracts for
other manufacturers’ turbines, which was, for example, one of the rationales behind the senvion
acquisition (for more information, see “12.9.3 acquisition of selected european assets of
senvion”).
our sgre segment offers a range of services that can be purchased through tailor-made long-
term contracts or on a more transactional basis, aligned with individual customer needs. our
o&m contracts are designed in a flexible manner, with many different selectable modules based
on core services (the modules are described in more detail in the following sections). a typical
o&m contract includes fundamental maintenance services, including preventive (both
pre-determinedandcondition-based)andcorrectiveworkscope.thescopetypicallycoversworks
performed physically on-site, but also extensive remote maintenance activities performed by our
sgre segment’s global network of monitoring & diagnostics centers. o&m contracts are usually
backed by a performance warranty (described in more detail further below) which provides
assurancetothecustomerthatsgrewillmaintaintheirassetwiththerequiredquality.oursgre
segment refers to an extensive scope o&m contract with a term of ten or more years as a long-
term program, and its service business unit focuses on attracting customers to such deals, which
provide long-term profitable revenue streams and a significant contribution to our sgre
segment’sorderbacklogasawhole.
12.4.1.4.1 performanceguarantees
in our sgre segment, o&m agreements are usually supported by an availability warranty as a
mechanism to provide our customers with assurance that our products will perform well on their
site. the warranties are typically either based on percentage uptime of the asset (time-based
warranty) or percentage of theoretical maximum energy yield from the asset (yield-based
warranty). our sgre segment offers competitive levels of warranted availability. in the event of
performancebelowthatlevel,thecustomerwouldbeabletorecoverthemissingrevenuearising
from such underperformance. these warranties are an important part of our sgre segment’s
value proposition to its customers as they ensure that customers benefit from a clear allocation
of risk as well as providing a cost-effective mechanism through which sgre can assume those
risks from the customer’s project that our sgre segment is well-positioned to manage and
mitigate.
our sgre segment’s most recent innovation track in this area is the development of a “revenue-
basedavailability”tool,whichmeasuresandincentivizesperformanceonthebasisnotjustofthe
customer’s energy generation, but also on the basis of revenues obtained from the sale of that
energy. this is an important move to ensure that incentives and operating model are properly
aligned with the value drivers of the customer business case of our sgre segment, since the
industry now has an ever increasing number of wind turbines moving into low-subsidy or post-
subsidy environments. this increases the importance of taking into consideration the market
energypricewhenplanningandconductingo&m.
the first pilot contract using this availability tool has already been signed, and development is
wellunderwaytoformalizetheproductasastandardofferingofoursgresegment.
12.4.1.4.2 lifeextensionservices
asinstalled wind turbinetechnologyagesandinordertoaddressincreasingcustomerinterestto
maximize the profitability of their installed assets for longer, sgre offers a “life extension”
service which allows for the extension of the useful lives of a customer’s turbines from typically
20 to up to 30 years (counted as from the start of operation of the turbine). this is a full-scope
maintenance program including a series of structural upgrades and monitoring features to
ensure that customers’ wind turbines are safe to operate while extending energy production
334
beyond the original design life. with this service, sgre offers its customers a guarantee relating
to the safety for the public, personnel and wind power plant assets, while keeping customers’
maintenancecostsundercontrolduringtheextendedlifeperiod.
since 2014, sgre has performed life extension services, with lifetime assessments being carried
out across more than 2,800 wind turbine generators as of november 30, 2019. through its
internal lifetime modeling, sgre’s life extension program combines a number of parameters,
such as turbine failure rates, structural analysis or turbine field data, to offer a specific, tailor-
made maintenance for each type of platform and for the full remaining lifetime of the wind
turbine. this can be further enhanced by implementation of necessary upgrades to bring the
turbine up to the latest state-of-the-art, including repairs, reinforcements and components
substitutionstoachieveenhancedperformanceofcustomerassets.
12.4.1.4.3 annualenergyproductionupgrades
through its aep upgrade solutions such as “energy thrust”, “power boost”, “power curve
upgrade” or “high wind ride through”, our sgre segment updates older wind turbines with
the latest performance enhancement technology. this results in improved wind turbine output,
which can increase aep by up to 5%, depending on the variant and without compromising the
turbine’s structural integrity. the additional energy is obtained through the adaptation of each
turbine to the specific wind conditions of its location by software and firmware updates,
resulting in improved performanceinallrangesofthepowercurve.theseproductsarevalidated
by our sgre segment and required assessments are obtained from an independent assurance
provider,suchasdnvglse(germany).
our sgre segment is continuously innovating, and by combining its extensive turbine design,
field performance data and advanced analytics modeling, it explores new ways for performance
upgrades to allow for the best possible wind power plant asset management in line with its
customers’businessobjectives.
12.4.1.4.4 offshorelogistics
the new generation of offshore wind power plants is often located far from shore, which
generally means unstable weather conditions, significant wave heights and increased travel time
for spare parts and technicians. in addition, both wind power plants and wind turbines continue
to increase in size. traditionally, the farther an offshore wind power plant was from shore, the
more expensive its maintenance. to address this, our sgre segment introduced service operation
vessels thatwork asfloating workshops, therebysignificantly reducingcosts.oursgresegment’s
integrated logistics are focused on achieving maximum yield and overcoming challenging
conditions when servicing offshore wind power plants. customers can choose from service
operations vessels, helicopter services or crew transfer vessels for regular maintenance
operations. when a heavy component exchange is needed, chartered jack-up vessels can be
deployed quickly. our sgre segment’s service offering for offshore wind power plants improves
offshore wind power plant availability through greater efficiency, less weather downtime due to
safe operation at high waves and fast response to service needs by operation within the
boundaries of its customers’ wind power plants. in the fiscal year 2019, our sgre segment
introduceda“service train” conceptbywhich it deploysonecommon vessel across multiple wind
power plants with several customers to reduce the downtime associated with scheduled service.
in addition, it also introduced a program aimed at securing a safe and reliable installation and
start-upofeachoffshorewindturbinewithin24hours.
12.4.1.4.5 bladeservices
blades have a direct impact on the quantity as well as the cost of the energy that turbines
produce. they are the most expensive components of a wind turbine. they are also vulnerable
components, since they bear extreme loads and weather conditions, thus requiring professional
care. if blades are not checked for damage and wear at suitable intervals, turbine yield can
potentially decrease over time. our sgre segment offers different services for blades of onshore
335
and offshore wind turbines, including blade inspections (with reporting and assessment), repairs,
upgradesandupdates,bladeintegritymanagementandartificialintelligencesolutions.
for example, our sgre segment combines drone inspection data with an online platform called
hermesai,whichispresentedthroughagraphicuserinterfacecalledvisionbasedassetintegrity
(“vbai”) that controls the process. vbai’s artificial intelligence (“ai”) uses the power of cloud
computing, ai, machine learning, big data and specialist interaction to enable predictive
maintenance and statistics as well as to identify blade damage. customers receive a thorough
analysis of their turbine’s blade conditions and sufficient data to make informed decisions about
anynecessaryrepair.
furthermore, “poweredge” care is a durable and cost-optimized protection solution that
mitigates theimpact oferosiontotheleadingedgeoftheblades. “poweredge”careisdesigned
asalifetime solutiontopreventreoccurringrepairs,thusminimizing theturbine’sdowntimeand
providing an aep improvement relative to eroded blades. the overall solution is validated by
sgreandhasbeencertifiedbydnvglse.
12.4.1.4.6 diagnostics
our sgre segment’s remote diagnostics approach encompasses a wide range of digital tools
supporting the service of customer assets and is available for all onshore and offshore wind
turbines and wind power plants. diagnostics services include (i) 24/7 alarm notification and
management (e.g., so that when an alarm is detected, knowledge-based alarm rules are applied
to quickly and accurately reset and restart a turbine without a site visit), (ii) software version
updates, (iii) diagnostic support (e.g., to remotely identify the cause for an alarm and try to fix it
remotely, or suggest on-site actions), (iv) turbine set-up control (a detection service that
recognizes any changes in a wind turbine generator from the parameters defined in its profile),
(v) basic, advanced and model-based vibration, (vi) antivirus protecting solutions and (vii) oil
particle counters. with respect to vibration diagnostics, by picking up vibrations on turbine
components, sensors can lower the risk of slow- and fast-developing damages by early detection,
and optimize maintenance strategies – such as automatic turbine shutdown or preventive repair.
this helps to save service costs and reduce downtime. in addition, advanced vibration diagnostics
tools that accurately pinpoint vibrations within the drivetrain (composed of the gearbox and the
generator, which the wind turbine needs to produce electricity) allow to predict damage up to
three years in advance, allowing for optimized risk and asset management, and minimizing
downtime.
through model-based diagnostics, our sgre segment gathers data from around 6 million sensors
from turbines worldwide and creates roughly 1.5 million individual digital models of the
turbines’ ancillary systems. the system flags around 250,000 deviations per year but not all of
these positives correspond to real-life faults. algorithms filter out the costly false-positives and
insignificant deviations. this drops the count of significant deviations that need to be addressed
to approximately 8,000 site visits a year. in addition, service technicians’ reports and the analysis
ofdamagedpartsarefedintoaknowledgebasesupportingseveraldigitaltools.
12.4.1.4.7 multi-brandmaintenanceservices
in the rapidly changing market environment of the wind industry, wind turbine fleets of most
wind turbine operators show an increased diversity of technologies. as owners grow their fleet
sizes, most expand their fleets beyond a single turbine manufacturer, either due to economics,
performance, or through the integration of fleets from m&a activities. the service market
segment is becoming increasingly complex for service providers and owners alike. from
inefficient repair loops, over unexpected and unbudgeted failures well outside of the warranty
period, to older equipment with limited attention or supply chain, or even to turbine
manufacturers shifting focus and, in some cases, even leaving markets, the areas where owners
requireinnovativeengineeringapproachesarenumerous.
sgre possesses specialized know-how and valuable insights for multiple brands and maintains
turbinesofmanyserialoems.thefleetofthird-partytechnologiesundermaintenance(including
336
vestas, ge, nordex, suzlon, senvion, legacy made, bonus, adwen and other technologies) had
1.7 gw installed capacity in total at the end of the fiscal year 2019. multi-brand services can be
attractive for onshore and offshore wind power plants with mixed brands, irrespective of the
wind power plant’s size, and wind power plant owners who are looking for alternative o&m
providers, since such multi-brand services allow leveraging economies of scale. the senvion
acquisition, including a large part of senvion’s european onshore service business and associated
assets and operations to provide full service, positions our sgre segment to service a broader
range of wind turbine technologies. the transaction added around 9 gw of serviced fleet and
operationsin13countries,takingoursgresegment’smulti-brandfootprinttomorethan10gw
and its fleet under maintenance to approximately 72 gw (as of june 30, 2020). in addition, since
the closing of the transaction, sgre has secured several orders relating to the senvion fleet,
including onshore and offshore contracts. thus, with the acquisition, our sgre segment
significantlyincreasedits“otheroem”fleetundermaintenance.
leveraging global reach, our sgre segment offers a flexible service portfolio thatcanbetailored
to its customers’ diverse operating models and needs. providing an integrated asset
management, our sgre segment’s services range from corrective and preventive maintenance to
upgrades and from balance of plant solutions to energy management services. it also provides
advanceddiagnosticsandotherdata-drivencapabilities,aswellascustomizedoffshoreservices.
12.4.1.5 newadjacentbusinessfields
with the rapid development of renewable energies, our sgre segment has begun to enter into
new, adjacent business fields within the area of renewable electricity generation, such as solar,
hybrid solutions, storage, floating or hydrogen. however, these activities represent only a small
fractionofsgre’scurrentbusiness.
(cid:129) solar – our sgre segment has recently offered solar downstream services, mainly in india,
which are currently not considered part of sgre’s core business. in addition, sgre
manufactures solar inverters through its subsidiary gamesa electric. however, sgre is
continuouslyreviewingitsbusinessperformanceandmarketdevelopmenttoadjustitsstrategy
accordingly,forexampleaspartoftherestructuringinindia.
(cid:129) hybrid–asthemarketevolves,oursgresegmentisexpandingintothegrowinghybridpower
solutions market segment. these solutions combine multiple power generation sources,
including wind. hybrid power leverages the advantages of the complementary energy profiles
of wind and solar power, for example by balancing the energy generated by solar power
during the day with the wind, which is usually stronger at night. depending on location and
hourly profile, a hybrid system can optimize energy feed-in, grid stability and capacity factor.
in addition, customers can save costs and achieve a higher energy production by sharing land,
gridinfrastructureandmaintenanceservicesforthedifferentassets.
(cid:129) storage – as the energy sector increasingly shifts towards a growing share of renewables, it
faces new challenges, including the fluctuation of energy generation as well as the issue of
stranded costs for early phase-out of conventional power plants. our sgre segment is
continuously monitoring storage related solutions and technologies. for example, our sgre
segment has recently invested in electric thermal energy storage (“etes”). the first test site
with 5 mwh capacity was implemented in 2014. for the proof of system, sgre opened a new
pilot plant in hamburg-altenwerder in june 2019. sgre is exploring alternatives around the
nextstepsinthedevelopmentofitsetestechnology.
(cid:129) floating – at present, the offshore market has certain limitations on expansion due to the
technology used for offshore turbine foundations (called monopoles) which are embedded
into the sea floor. the cost-effectiveness of the solution is challenged when water depth
exceeds40meters. sgre’soffshore business unit is activelyexploringfloatingfoundationsthat
will allow the deployment of wind power plants in deeper waters near heavily-populated
coastal areas with proper wind resources, such as the east chinese sea, the u.s. eastern coast,
the gulf of vizcaya or the irish sea. several prototypes are expected to be tested during the
courseof2021and2022.

(cid:129) hydrogen – green hydrogen production is projected to increase during the next years as the
energy sector is expected to contribute significantly to the decarbonization of the economy.
industrial-scale production of green hydrogen will require a significant deployment of
renewable energy technologies and we expect that wind turbine generators will play a key
role. in addition to onshore opportunities, we expect that offshore wind turbine technology
may provide a relevant share of generation capacity required for green hydrogen production,
mostly due to comparably larger project size stemming from less limitations of offshore. in this
field, oursgresegmentis currently exploring different technological alternatives varyingfrom
so-called “plug and play solutions” for existing wind power plants to integrated electrolyzers
inside the wind turbine to produce hydrogen locally, instead of feeding electricity into the

there are modularized offerings for each customer segment in each business unit (onshore,
offshore and service). service customers are not only those with installed sgre wind turbines,
but in some cases also with turbines from other brands (as part of the multi-brand service
offering;see“12.4.1.4.7multi-brandmaintenanceservices”).
regarding strategic customers of a certain size, our sgre segment supplies more than a dozen
global accounts as a key supplier. some examples of such accounts are iberdrola, enel, ørsted
andequinor.
in line with widespread industry practice, sgre typically grants warranties to its customers in
connection with repair and replacement obligations in case of component defects or functional
errors relating to sgre’s products during the warranty period, which generally ranges between
two and five years. furthermore, sgre’s wind turbine generators are supported by certain
warranties with respect to specific performance criteria such as noise, the power curve, or –
normally if accompanied by a service contract – the availability of the turbines throughout the
year. certain of sgre’s service contracts include full-scope warranties for up to 30 years, which
cover not only availability, but also components, including exchange costs (such as costs for
cranesandvessels).

12.4.3.2 manufacturing
oursgresegmentmanufactureswindturbinesatitsfacilities ineurope,theunitedstates,india,
brazil, china and morocco. our sgre segment has established a technical presence close to its
customers across the world. its manufacturing base is designed to ensure an efficient production
process from the design of the wind turbines to the manufacturing of all critical components.
339
our sgre segment operates blade factories, nacelle assembly factories and other factories (such
asgearbox,converterandcabinetfactories).
the decision as to whether a specific component of a wind turbine should be produced in-house
or outsourced to third-party suppliers is determined by looking at three different dimensions:
capacity, cost and local content or industrialization requirements. with information from a sales
plan elaborated by the sales and marketing team for the upcoming years (split by products and
geographies), our sgre segment defines the amount of capacity required at each location. then,
basedontheabovecriteria,a“makeorbuy”decisionismade.
blade factories produce the entire blade for a wind turbine. in recent years, our sgre segment
implemented structural shell production in all its models, which requires less infrastructure and
can be implemented more rapidly. our sgre segment started to implement carbon fiber in
longer blades to further reduce weight. its industrial strategy also aims for a balance among
several options for manufacturing blades, including “make”, “buy” and “build-to-print” (under
which our sgre segment designs the blade, while the manufacturing is outsourced). our main
blade factories are located in fort madison (united states), aalborg (denmark), hull (united
kingdom), tangier (morocco), nellore (india), somozas (spain), lingang (china) and vagos
(portugal; this plant was acquired in the context of the senvion acquisition). a new factory for
wind turbine blades (as well as nacelles) is planned in le havre (france), with start of production
expected for the beginning of 2022. at the end of 2019, sgre stopped the manufacturing of
onshore blades in its aalborg factory (the location now manufactures blades for offshore
turbines only). in addition, a decision to close the blade factory in aoiz (spain) due to
competitiveness considerations was made in june 2020. this plant is specialized in small turbine
modelsmainlyforthespanishmarket.
in addition to its own manufacturing, sgre sources blades from third-party manufacturers
located in mexico, brazil, turkey, india, china and poland, either providing its own blade designs
orusingthedesignfromthethird-partymanufacturer.
nacelle assembly factories assemble the nacelle for the wind turbine. the nacelle is the structure
placed upon the tower, housing the gearbox (for onshore wind turbines), generator,
transformer, electronics and other components. attached to the nacelle is the rotor consisting of
a hub and three blades. our sgre segment’s main nacelle assembly factories are located in
hutchinson/kansas (united states), camaçari (brazil), brande (denmark), cuxhaven (germany),
ágreda (spain), aliaga (turkey), mamandur (india) and tianjin (china). in addition, sgre

tower factories produce the tower for the wind turbine. sgre is a minority shareholder in tower
manufacturer windar renovables, s.l., which has factories in spain, india, mexico, brazil and
russia.
generator factories produce the generator transforming the rotation energy to electricity. our
sgre segment’s generator factories are located in reinosa (spain), camaçari (brazil) and tianjin
(china). in addition, direct drive generators are assembled in brande (denmark) and cuxhaven
(germany).
our sgre segment operates gearbox plants in spain, with the main factories located in lerma
and sigüeiro. a gearbox is typically used in a wind turbine to increase rotational speed from a
low-speedrotortoahigherspeedelectricalgenerator.
our sgre segment’s converter factories are located in madrid (spain), valencia (spain) and
tianjin (china). converters enable the management of the electrical output of the wind turbine
to optimize it following grid requirements. our sgre segment produces converters for wind and
solarapplications.
in addition, oursgresegmentoperatescabinetsfactoriesinvalencia(spain)andtianjin(china).
a control cabinet monitors certain parameters of a wind turbine in order to operate the turbine

in the most efficient way. dependingon the direction and thespeedofthewind, theposition of
the nacelle and the blades are modified to maximize production, as well as to control the loads
transmittedbythewindthroughtherestofthewindturbine.
with respect to the newly-acquired onshore blade manufacturing plant in vagos (portugal), we
expect that this plant will help to strengthen our sgre segment’s industrial value chain and
reduce dependency on supplier sourcing from asia. the plant can produce more than 1,300
bladesperyear. in addition, thefacility is complementarytoexistingsgrebladecapacitiesandis
expected to support international sales. its location and logistics are suitable to source the
europeanmarkets,allowingforsignificantcostoptimizationandmitigatingsupplychainrisks.
in addition, our sgre segment is currently building a new nacelle assembly facility for the
offshore business in taiwan, at a site located in the port of taichung. it will be our sgre
segment’s first offshore nacelle assembly plantoutsideofeurope.theplantallowssgretofulfill
local content requirements. moreover, in may 2020, sgre started an expansion plan for its
nacelle assembly facility in taichung, to form a regional offshore wind nacelle industrial hub
together with taiwan-based suppliers. the expansion, which is subject to certain conditions, is
planned to start after the nacelle assembly work is completed in 2022. the first project to be
supported by the broader manufacturing plant will be the 300 mw hai long 2 project (with
nacelle productionfor theprojectscheduledtobeginin2024andturbineinstallation isexpected
to follow thereafter). sgre is also building a new nacelle and blade manufacturing plant in le
havre (france). among others, blades and nacelles for the wind turbines to be supplied for two
large french offshore projects totaling almost 1 gw are planned to be manufactured at this new
plant. furthermore, our sgre segment is considering to use its existing nellore facility in india

our sgre segment has implemented innovative logistical set-ups, for example with its plant for
offshore nacelles in cuxhaven, germany, which represented an investment of approximately
€ 200 million. this new set-up for offshore markets uses two purpose-built transport vessels.

12.4.3.3 procurement
our sgre segment operates with a large supplier and contractor base, and had approximately
18,000 tier-1 suppliers with procurement volumes of approximately € 8 billion in the fiscal year
2019.thenumberoftier-1supplierswasreducedduringthefiscalyear2020.
oursgresegmentiscontinuouslyworkingondiversifyingtheriskinthesupplychainbyworking
with multiple suppliers globally and striving to reduce the volume of sourcing from single
suppliers. our sgre segment is leveraging partnerships with selected key suppliers in particular
for gearboxes, bearings, transformers and blades, with the aim of further enhancing its
technology and innovation capabilities and its technology position in the market. other relevant
materials include hydraulic systems, power controls, steel parts and fabrications, casting,
compositematerials,towerconversion,resinsandstructuraladhesive.
sgre has entered into supply agreements with siemens energy mainly relating to the
procurement of electrical components as well as various procurement agreements with siemens
group companies relating to (i) certain supplies used in sgre’s manufacturing process and other
operations, and (ii) the provision by siemens ag of certain procurement services for sgre,
enabling sgre to benefit from a greater collective bargaining power. for more information, see

“18.1.2.4.6transactionsbetweenthesiemensgroupandsgre”.theawardsystemisdesignedto
ensure that supplies are carried out under market conditions, as well as to enable the
participationofothersuppliers.
aspartofthenecessary increase in purchasingvolumeduetothegrowth andits needfor global
supplies, our sgre segment is striving to strike a balance between local content requirements
andtheglobalsupplychain.
our sgre segment has a specific supplier relationship policy in place, which provides a group-
wide framework for management and control of procurement activities. the aim is toensurethe
impartiality, transparency and objectivity of its supplier selection processes; the policy also
establishes the channels and mechanisms neededtoensurethatsuppliers’ conductis ethical. one
of these mechanisms is the p2p (“purchase to pay”) process implemented in order to reduce risks
in the purchasing process and to ensure a strict adherence and compliance throughout the
process,avoidingmisconductandfraudalongthewholesupplychain.
overall, the activities of the supply chain support are guided by principles such as the
development of the local supply base while contributing to local wealth creation, working with
suppliers to achieve high-quality component design in order to reduce costs and creating
opportunities for qualified suppliers to export to other regions based on their competitiveness.
these are contemplated in internal activities regarding, for example, commodity strategies and
new product introduction, and by its supplier life cycle management team. for instance,
sustainability self-assessments are applied to strategic suppliers or suppliers located in high-risk
countries. furthermore, an external sustainability audit is carried out by different third-party
providerstodetectanynon-compliance.
our sgre segment’s code of conduct for suppliers and third-party intermediaries, released in
2018, is included in the general purchasing conditions, framework contracts and purchase
agreements with each supplier, and is also included in procurement tools to ensure compliance.
in 2019, sgre released a booklet with its code of conduct for suppliers and third-party
intermediaries which documents in detail its expectations towards its suppliers. furthermore,
sgre has a supplier quality manual in place which deals with health, safety and environmental
guidelines, as well as quality requirements for the qualification of suppliers, components and
services.
sgre also monitors critical suppliers (defined according to parameters such as a purchasing
volume over € 50,000 or operating or being based in a high-risk country from a corporate
responsibility perspective) and keeps track of high sustainability risk suppliers which it identifies
accordingtopre-definedcriteria,e.g.,relatingtoincidentsofcompliancemisconduct.
12.4.3.4 productdesignandlifecycle
the product life cycle process within our sgre segment follows a detailed, multidisciplinary plan
for the development of products, which is coordinated by the product portfolio management
organization within sgre, receiving input from cross-functional teams. the process includes an
analysis of customer requirements, ehs regulations, industrialization requirements, supply chain
restrictions and operations track record. after the conceptual design and the functional
definition, thedetailedproductdesigniscarriedout,includingprototypetestingandverification
of the identified requirements as well as product validation and risk analysis. thereafter, the
product moves to the industrialization phase. once delivered and commissioned, the product is
operated and maintained by the services business unit, and is optimized through continuous
product improvement. in addition, after-sales activities, such as field upgrades, refurbishments,
retrofitsandadd-onfeaturescanbeofferedtocustomers.
12.4.3.5 salesandmarketing
our sgre segment markets its products through a global sales force with local offices in almost
40countriesandineveryregioninordertoensurecustomerproximity.themainsalesofficesare

located in the united states, mexico, brazil, spain, denmark, germany, india and china. our
sgre segment’s sales force is responsible for the identification of sales opportunities and their
management, technical support, order processing and day-to-day contact with customers. in
addition, our sgre segment is introducing focused market strategies tailored to different types
ofcustomers.
our sgre segment’s staff in sales and marketing functions comprised approximately 1,600
employees as of september 30, 2019 worldwide. the compensation of the sales force is partly
performance-based. marketing is organized to cover the three business units onshore, offshore
andservice andtheir respective sales regions, with nearly40localsalesofficesandteamspresent
around the globe. certain functions, notably our sgre segment’s global brand strategy and
marketing communications, are managed by the corporate affairs unit, which defines a uniform
appearance and corporate design of all publications and advertising materials throughout its
organization. to support a corporate identity at the level of our sgre segment, this central unit
also defines the brand strategy with respect to all brands used by our sgre segment, develops
marketingconceptsandcarriesoutpartoftheirimplementationalongsidemarketingteamswith
each of the business units. sgre’s sales model is generally based on direct sales, with the
exception of the offshore business in china, where currently a license model through a

12.4.3.6 projectdevelopmentandexecution
our sgre segment executes projects worldwide and offers engineering, procurement, execution,
project management, financing support and after-sales services, among others. depending on
market requirements as well as sgre’s regional or project-specific approach, the scope of sgre’s
involvement may include undertaking a full epc scope or wind power plant development
activitiesinsomecases.
bytheendofthefiscal year2019,sgrehadinstalled, intheaggregate,nearly16gwofonshore
windpowerplantswithanepcscopeandhadfurtherprojectswithepcscopeunderconstruction
of more than 1.6 gw. for example, for the west bakr wind project in egypt, our sgre segment
will install 96 sg 2.6-114 onshore turbines through a turnkey epc contract and will provide long-
term maintenance for a 15-year service term. all civil and most electrical and logistical work will
be handled by local subcontractors and all the turbine towers will be produced in egypt. the
projectwillincreasethecountry’sinstalledwindenergycapacityby18%upto1,650mw.
in offshore wind, sgre is the industry leader (see “11.5.4.2 competitive environment in the
offshore new unit market segment”) and has successfully executed a project pipeline of nearly
16 gw (mostly without extended or epc scope) by the end of june 2020. a recent example that
highlights this excellence in project management and execution is in the successful delivery of
the world’s largest offshore wind power plant commissioned to date, hornsea one (source:
ørsted’s website for the project, hornseaprojectone.co.uk, section “about the project”), off the
coast of yorkshire in the north sea, which was completed on time, in budget and within quality
targets in 2019. in the hornsea one project, 174 sgre swt-7.0 mw turbines were installed,
whichrepresentedasignificantlogisticalandmanufacturingundertaking.duringtheinstallation
phase, sgre was able to further demonstrate its innovation and market-leading experience with
individual wind turbines being installed and commissioned in less than 24 hours each and over
98% availability from the first day of operation of the project (according to our monitoring data
for the project). project management excellence, highly skilled passionate employees, close
collaboration with customers and over nearly 30 years of offshore experience enable sgre to
maintainitsleadershipininternationaloffshoremarkets.
together with its partners, our sgre segment also supports customers to develop tailored
financing solutions to address their specific requirements. forexample, for theno.5thanhhai1
nearshore wind power plant in vietnam, sgre coordinated the discussions with the financing
parties, which includes the danish export credit agency, an international bank and one of
vietnam’s largest banks, to offer its customer a highly bankable and competitive debt package.
furthermore, through the preferred financing agreement between sgre s.a. and siemens ag
343
(for more information, see “18.1.1.2.3(1) preferred financing agreement sgre”), sgre can also
provide solutions regarding equity financing as well as debt and commercial finance for projects
viasfs.
in 2020, sgre introduced a project management framework for the onshore business unit. this
framework – “pm@sgre” – has the goal to improve project management efficiency and
effectiveness.adedicatedprojecthasbeensetuptoacceleratetheharmonizationandconsistent
implementation of this framework into the operational business across the three business units
onshore,offshoreandservice.
in addition, in some countries sgre also assumes exposure to development activities.
traditionally, this has been the case in india, where in most oftheprojects sgrehadexposureto
development activities. outside india, the exposure to development activities is more limited (in
the fiscal year 2019, sgre’s development activities based on installed capacity represented
approximately 5% of the total volume installed outside india). with the implementation of the
leap program, and the restructuring in india, our sgre segment is planning to have a more
selective approach to project development to reduce exposure to associated risks. for example,
full own development is intended to be more limited, and development terms are being
adjusted. our sgre segment will continuously review its development assets and different
optionsregardingsuchassets.

the it organization has a clear focus on cybersecurity, digitalization, standardization and
harmonization of processes and applications. our sgre segment sees information and the assets
it supports as strategic assets for the business, for which reason it has control systems in place to
ensure the protection thereof in terms of availability, confidentiality, integrity, authentication
and traceability. our sgre segment’s it processes include, among others, (i) back-ups, by way of
duplication of critical infrastructures and regular production of back-up copies of information in
separate physical locations, and a policy for review and control of the integrity of the copies
made; (ii) security of physical access to the data processing center and of software access
(including access restrictions, encryption of sensitive information and analysis of identified
security incidents, among others); (iii) controls relating to the maintenance and implementation
of computer applications, implementation and migrations plans, risk management via separate
environments for operation and tests and simulation and other measures. sgre has an
operationalcybersecurityapplicationinplace.
since the foundation of sgre in its current set-up, back in 2017, sgre is driving a transformation
based on stand-alone company it applications, tools and infrastructure. in parallel, a clear focus
has been set on the gradual reduction of transitional service agreements agreed between sgre
and siemens at the time of the merger (with a maximum term of four years), with the aim of
supporting both governance and operational independence from siemens. in this connection,
among other initiatives, sgre has developed internal capacities or outsourced certain functions
to specialized third-party providers in several key functional areas. in 2019, our sgre segment
expanded its digital team working on the digital transformation of wind energy. this team has

12.4.4 r&d
wind turbines developed and manufactured by our sgre segment are in permanent evolution,
incorporating the latest technological advances with the aim of increasing both power and
performance. overall, our sgre segment employs approximately 2,000 dedicated r&d staff
aroundtheworld(asofseptember30,2019).inthefiscalyears2017through2019,r&dactivities
were focused, in particular, on the development of new wind turbine models, software and the
optimization of the components’ performance. the sgre segment’s research and development
expenses amounted to € 208 million, € 166 million and € 189 million in the fiscal years 2019,
2018 and 2017, respectively. furthermore, the sgre segment showed additions to other
intangible assets of € 160 million, € 129 million and € 76 million in the fiscal years 2019, 2018
and 2017, respectively, which largely relate to capitalized research and development expenses.
the periods presented did not include any amortization of intangible assets acquired in business
combinations and goodwill impairments for sgre. in the fiscal year 2019, sgre invested broadly
the same amount as capitalized development costs, which are shown as additions to other
intangibleassets.
our sgre segment’s r&d activities are carried out mainly through seven technology centers
located in bangalore (india), boulder (united states), brande (denmark), hamburg (germany),
zamudio, madrid and pamplona (all in spain). the r&d activities brande, bilbao and pamplona
are focused on the nacelle and its components. the facilities in madrid and brande are equipped
withtestbenchesfortestingandvalidatingsoftwaresystemsforwindpower,pv,energystorage
and hybrid power systems. the bangalore center serves global engineering and technology

sgre also cooperates with renowned specialized institutions in the field of wind energy and
fosters research partnerships across countries, organizations and disciplines. in addition, sgre’s
partnership with ørsted and the three u.k. universities of hull, sheffield and durham is also
lookingathowrenewableenergyresearch canlower thecosts ofoffshorewindpower.thisfive-
year partnership funded by the u.k. government under its engineering and physical science
research council enables sgre and its partner to develop new solutions relating to structural
health monitoring and generator topologies. sgre is also collaborating with siemens in the
development of thermal energy storage in a project called “etes” that is co-funded by the
german federal ministry of economic affairs of energy. within the digitalization field, our sgre
segment is cooperating with the university of carlos iii in madrid in a three-year project, funded
by the spanish institution “centro para el desarrollo tecnológico industrial” (cdti). the project
comprises research on edge computing technologies, probabilistic design and power plant
control technologies, while looking for synergetic solutions with other sectors’ needs and
solutions. furthermore, our sgre segment regularly showcases some of its innovations at
exhibitionsandtradefairsinthewindenergyindustry.

in addition, it is particularly important to our sgre segment to protect the results of its
innovation activities with regard to new product developments and business fields against
unauthorized use. throughout its history, sgre has patented a large number of innovations,
including products, methods and processes. our sgre segment’s patent portfolio includes an
extensive number of patents that are necessary for its business activities, which it obtains by
exercising its rights regarding employee inventions and submitting them for registration. sgre
held over 5,800 active patents as of june 30, 2020 (this figure contemplates, among others, over
2,200activepatentsacquiredfromsenvionunderthesenvionacquisition).patentsincludeutility
models in denmark, spain, germany and other jurisdictions as well, among them a few patents
and utility models registered for foreign sgre companies in foreign jurisdictions only. however,
with respect to trade secrets and specific secret process technologies, our sgre segment
sometimes elects not to pursue protection through patent registration, as this would require the
disclosureofsecretknow-how.foradescriptionofcertainsgredisputesrelatingtoiprights,see
“12.8.2.4disputesordisagreementsregardingiprights”.
12.4.6 sustainability,environmental,socialresponsibilityandgovernance
sgre voluntarily adheres to various codes of ethics or codes of practice, including (i) “united
nations global compact”, which is promoted by the united nations (“un”) with the goal of
promoting commitment and support of the ten principles related to human and labor rights,
environmental protection andthefight againstcorruption, (ii) theglobalreportinginitiative, an
independent international organization that has pioneered sustainability reporting, relating to
the exchange of transparent and reliable information on sustainability, (iii) the science based
targets, a joint international initiative of the carbon disclosure project, the un global compact,
the world resources institute, the world wide fund for nature and the we mean business
coalition with the aim of reducing carbon emissions in a measurable manner and to a sufficient
level to meet the objective of not exceeding 2ºc of global warming established in the paris
agreement, and many other initiatives relating to diversity, sustainability, climate change and
similar topics. in december 2019, sgre signed the “business ambition for 1.5c – our only
future” pledge during the climate change talks held in madrid, committing to meet objectives
relating to its emissions evaluated through the un’s sbti, or by setting a public goal to reach
net-zero emissions by no later than 2050 (source: sgre website, journal section, “siemens
gamesa reaffirms pledge to meet un’s climate targets for industry”, published on december 11,
2019). as of august 24, 2020, there were 274 companies that had committed to this initiative
(source: un global compact website, “take action” section, “business ambition for 1.5 c – join
the visionary corporate leaders”). sgre is a member of various international sustainability
indexes, such as dow jones sustainability indices of the s&p dow jones indices, which are float-
adjusted market capitalization weighted indices that measure the performance of selected
346
companies with respect to economic, environmental and social criteria using a best-in-class
approach; the ftse4good index series of the financial times stock exchange index, the ethibel
sustainability index, the stoxx® euro sustainability and the global challenges index. in 2020,
sgre received an a rating (on a scale of aaa-ccc), an upgrade from its former bb rating, in the
msci esg ratings assessment, enabling sgre’s inclusion in the msci indices and with an
investment grade rating. the msci esg ratings measure companies, according to exposure to
industry-specificesgrisksandtheabilitytomanagethoserisks.
in addition, sgre has identified several strategic lines and actions to work on regarding
corporate social responsibility (“csr”), which are set forth in its 2018-2020 csr strategy,
including pillars such as integrity and transparency, green development and a responsible supply
chain, among others, as well as specific targets, actions and compliance control frameworks for
eachofthepillars.
anexampleofsgre’scommitment tosustainable developmentistheamountofguaranteesthat
qualify as “green” which added up to € 1.77 billion by the end of 2019. guarantee lines are
considered “green” when they are linked to transactions that contribute to the un’s sdgs, i.e.,
transactions focused on environmentally friendly, social or sustainable deals. for more
information,see“12.9.2certainsgrefinancingagreements”.
with nearly 100 gw of installed wind capacity as of september 30, 2019, sgre contributes to
cutting emissions of co by 259 million tons per year (data for the fiscal year 2019; based on the
2
calculation of total co emissions that would be generated annually with conventional fossil
2
fuels to produce the equivalent amount of electricity, in kwh, produced by sgre turbines on an
annual basis), roughly equivalent to planting 4 billion trees or removing the emissions of
170 million diesel cars (as per its own internal assessment based on the 2006 ipcc national
greenhouse gas inventories). sgre had undertaken to be carbon-neutral by 2025, by using
offsetting measures while working consistently to reduce all carbon emissions across its
operations, replacing conventional emission-intensive power sources with renewable energies. in
the second quarter of the fiscal year 2020, sgre communicated that it had achieved carbon
neutrality (including through offsetting) ahead of its 2025 target timeframe. sgre will continue
totransitionitselectricity supplyfromrenewablesources.asignificant shareofsgrelocationsin
denmark, germany and spain are already supplied with renewable energy. currently, this is
achievedthroughthepurchaseofgreenrenewablecertificatesthatguaranteethattheelectricity
has been generated by a renewable energy source. sgre has stated that it will also investigate
the feasibility of implementing renewable energy generating technologies at facility or project
sites in the future. in addition, sgre has defined a sustainable mobility plan (the “global
mobility & transportation policy framework”) which includes adecreasingset oflimits regarding
co for management fleet with different milestones to be achieved as from october 1, 2019,
2
2020 and 2021, respectively. sgre is currently implementing this framework, which will
contribute to sgre’s objectives regarding its (indirect) ghg emissions. in addition, sgre is
looking into the cost and feasibility of replacing part of the existing company vehicle fleet with,
for example, plug-in hybrids, electric vehicles, which will support sgre in its reduction of (direct)
ghg emissions. furthermore, sgre has one wind power project registered as a clean
development mechanism (“cdm”) under the united nations standards (un framework
convention on climate change). this project generates certified emission reductions (“cer”)
that are used to offset ghg emissions. the project is in the state of oaxaca in mexico and is
currently in operation. a decision has yet to be taken on the different deadlines and scenarios to
exchange the cers available for use and subsequently deleted from the cdm register to offset
sgre’sghgemissionsinkeepingwithitsclimateneutralstrategy.
sgre also uses several regulatory and voluntary instruments to achieve a positive net balance in
relation to biodiversity and the environment. these include company policies and procedure, full
compliance with permits granted by environmental and conservation authorities in each region
(whichsetoutrequirementstoensurethelocalenvironment’sprotection), settingenvironmental
and control plans and implementing management systems (the majority of which have been
certified according to the iso 14001 standard to prevent and control environmental risks), and
complying with regulations on conducting environmental impact studies (which include analysis
347
and prevention mechanisms with different alternatives and lay down corrective measures to
avoid,mitigateoroffsetanypossibledamagetobiodiversityandtheenvironment).
sgre pursues a life cycle approach so that its wind turbines not only provide clean energyduring
operation but are also resource-efficient and recyclable. sgre’s most significant efforts in this
area include, among others, reducing materials, waste, energy and water, optimizing packaging
and logistics, improving the turbines’ capacity factor for higher aep, reducing time between
service visits for less fuel consumption, applying remote diagnostics to increase availability,
protecting wildlife by using scada control, a modular design to optimize dismantling and waste
treatment, reusing and recycling components and materials and seeking alternative materials for
highrecyclability.
in addition, sgre has undertaken in its code of conduct (the “business conduct guidelines”
issued in 2018) to defend human rights. sgre is committed to observing international standards
on the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of the people affected by its operations,
guided by the un norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other
business enterprises with regard to human rights, the guidelines of the oecd, the tripartite
declaration of principles concerning multinational enterprises and social policy of the
international labor organization and the women’s empowerment principles of the un
development fund for women (unifem). in 2020, sgre was included in bloomberg’s gender-
equalityindex.
moreover, in early april 2020, sgre joined the irena coalition for action alongside over 100
leading renewable energy players calling for the sector to be at the core in leading a sustainable
recovery from the coronavirus crisis. in may 2020, sgre joined an expanded group of 270
executivesfrommajoreuropeancompaniesandbanks,eupoliticiansandindustrybodiestohave
signed up to the eu’s green recovery alliance that aims to drive a sustainable recovery path in
the wake of the coronavirus crisis. the alliance has committed among its signatories to work
together, share knowledge, and create synergies needed to deliver the investment decisions
requiredforagreenrecovery.
12.4.7 compliance
sgre’s compliance system is based on three pillars, namely (i) prevention (including effective
preventive measures such as risk management, policies and procedures, training and
communication to enable systematic misconduct to be avoided), (ii) detection (including
complete clarification through initiatives such as whistle-blowing channels aswell asprofessional
and fair investigations) and (iii) response (including explicit consequences and clear reactions to
supportthepreventionofmisconductandeliminatedeficiencies).
sgre’s compliance organization comprises different levels, headed by the chief compliance
officer, an internal independent and permanent figure who reports to the audit, compliance
and related party transactions committee of the board of directors as well as to the executive
committee. the internal audit department is responsible for adapting internal control systems
and examines the compliance organization. when requested by the chief compliance officer,
the internal audit department also conducts reviews on certain compliance regulations and
processesuptoacompletecheckofthecompliancesystem.thecompliancedepartmentoversees
the prevention supervision of the ethics culture and the creation thereof. overall responsibility
for compliance lies with the management of sgre and the managing directors/heads of the
individual sgre units. the board of directors is ultimately responsible for compliance within
sgre. its audit, compliance and related party transactions committee supervises the reviewing
of the compliance system’s efficiency, including proposingthecompliance organization’s budget.
the compliance organization is supported by several compliance officers who are responsible for
implementingthecompliancesystemsintheregionsandcountriesinwhichsgreoperates.
sgre’s business conduct guidelines lay the foundation for its internal regulations and express
sgre’s values, compliance-related responsibilities and behavioral framework for all managers,
employees and managing board members worldwide. sgre has developed and implemented a
compliance system as the basis for all its decisions and activities, focused on strictly complying
348
withalllawsandinternalregulationsaswellasprinciplesofethicalbusinessconduct.training,in
particular of employees who, by their functions, are exposed to specific compliance risks, is an
important element of sgre’s compliance system. in addition, a compliance risk assessment
evaluates these risks and defines mitigation measures. it also creates an awareness of compliance
risks, strengthens cooperation between the compliance organization and the operational units
and emphasizes the responsibility of the managing directors and management in general for
compliance-related topics. moreover, a clearing committee has been set up to assess the risks
resulting from disclosure of information and documents by sgre to law enforcement or other
governmentalagencies.
for risks related to the failing of our compliance system, see “3.4.4 our risk management and
internal controls may not prevent or detect compliance risks, which could result in investigations
by authorities, fines, damage claims, payment claims, the termination of relationships with
customers or suppliers and even governmental exclusion from businesses (blacklisting) as well as
reputational damage. further, our internal controls could fail to detect business risks in time or
atall.”.
12.4.8 insurance
sgre’s insurance policies are aimed at adequately covering its property, plant and equipment.
sgre has also entered into insurance policies to cover the wind turbines generators while they
are being assembled. effective as of october 1, 2019, sgre adhered to a global stand-alone
insurance program, which includes all-risk property damage insurance policies, civil liability
insurance policies, transport, chartering of ships and all-risk construction insurance policies.
marsh and mclennan acts as insurance broker and service provider for the global insurance
program. in addition, sgre s.a. has entered into d&o insurance policies as well as death and
disability insurance, among others, for executives, directors and other employees. as of the date

12.4.9 ratings
sgre has received ratings from several rating agencies. the following provides an overview of
the current ratings as of the date of the prospectus and of the definitions used by the respective

moody’s: according to the definition used by moody’s, obligations rated “baa” are judged to
be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess certain
speculative characteristics. moody’s appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each
generic rating classification. the modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the
higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range
ranking;andthemodifier3indicatesarankinginthelowerendofthatgenericrating
category.
a review indicates that a rating is under consideration for a change in the near term.
a rating can be placed on review for upgrade, downgrade, or more rarely with
direction uncertain. a review may end with a rating being upgraded, downgraded, or
confirmedwithoutachangetotherating.ratingsareplacedonreviewwhenarating
action may be warranted in the near term but further information or analysis is
needed to reach a decision on the need for a rating change or the magnitude of the
potential change. the time between the origination of a rating review and its
conclusion varies widely depending on the reason for the review and the amount of
time needed to obtain and analyze the information relevant to make a rating
determination. in some cases, the ability to conclude a review is dependent on
whether a specific event occurs, such as the completion of a corporate merger or the
execution of an amendment to a structured finance security. for the majority of
reviews, however, where the conclusion of the review is not dependent on an event
whose timing moody’s cannot control, reviews are typically concluded within 30 to 90
days. ratings on review for possible downgrade (upgrade) have historically concluded
withadowngrade(upgrade)overhalfofthetime.
fitch: according to fitch, a “bbb” rating indicates a good credit quality, i.e., that
expectations of default risk are currently low. the capacity for payment of financial
commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are
more likely to impair this capacity. the outlook indicates the direction a rating is

each rating reflects the opinion of the particular rating agency at the given reported point in
time. investors should consider each rating individually and obtain additional information and a

orsellsecurities.
12.7 risk management and compliance
we continuously seek to reduce various risks to which we are exposed, including the risk that
employees as well as representatives, consultants and business partners of siemens energy may
engage in illegal business practices. the aim of our risk management is to ensure the risks
associated with our business activities are in reasonable relation to the opportunities pursued,
while the aim of our compliance system is to prevent, detect and respond to potential violations
of applicable rules and regulations. as part of the siemens group, our gas and power segment
was integrated into the siemens group’s risk management and compliance systems. in
preparationforourseparationfromsiemens,wehaveestablishedourownriskmanagementand
compliance organizations, functions, tools and processes, the key features of which are based on
thesystemsdevelopedbysiemens.

12.7.1 riskmanagement
ourriskmanagementpolicystemsfromaphilosophyofcreatingeconomicvaluewhilemanaging
appropriate risks and opportunities and avoiding inappropriate risks. as risk management is an
integral part of how we plan and execute our business strategies, our group-wide risk
managementpolicyissetbytheexecutiveboard.ourorganizationalandaccountabilitystructure
requires each of the respective managements of our organizational units to implement risk
management programs that are tailored to their specific industries and responsibilities, while
beingconsistentwithgroup-widepoliciesoftheexecutiveboard.
risk management at siemens energy builds on a comprehensive, interactive and management-
oriented enterprise risk management (“erm”) approach that is integrated into the organization
352
and that addresses both risks and opportunities. our erm process aims for early identification,
evaluation and response to risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement
of our strategic, operational, financial and compliance objectives. the time horizon is typically
three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after
the execution of existing control measures. our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy
and effectiveness of our risk management. the processes and procedures implemented are
intended to help ensure that the executive board and the supervisory board are fully informed
aboutsignificantrisksinatimelymanner.
if risks have already been considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the consolidated financial
statements (e.g., as a provision or risk contingency), they are supposed to be incorporated with
their financial impact in the entity’s business objectives. as a consequence, only additional risks
arising from the same subject (e.g., deviations from business objectives, different impact
perspectives) should be considered. in order to provide a comprehensive view of our business
activities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way combining elements of both
topdownandbottom-upapproaches.
reporting generally follows periodic cycles but we complement this periodic reporting with an
ad-hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner. relevant risks
and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different
perspectives, including business objectives, reputation and regulatory requirements. if new risks
are identified the respective managements of our organizational units will become involved to
decide whether such risks shall be tracked in future risk reporting. responsibilities are assigned
for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on
the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. our general response strategies with
respecttorisksareavoidance,transfer,reductionoracceptanceoftherelevantrisk.
to oversee the erm process and further drive integration and harmonization of existing control
activitiestoalignwithlegalandoperationalrequirements,theexecutiveboardestablishedarisk
management and internal control organization, headed by the chief risk and internal control
officer. in order to allow for a meaningful discussion of risk at the group level, this organization
aggregates individual risks and opportunities of similar cause-and-effect nature into broader risk
and opportunity themes. the chief risk and internal control officer reports periodically to the
executive board on matters relating to the implementation, operation and oversight of the risk
and internal control system and assists the executive board, for example, in reporting to the
auditcommitteeofthesupervisoryboard.
12.7.2 compliance
at siemens energy we pursue a zero tolerance approach to corruption and other violations of
applicable law and our business conduct guidelines (“bcgs”). our compliance system is designed
toanchorintegrityandcomplianceinthemindsandactionsofallsiemensenergyemployeesand
external stakeholders. for this purpose, we conduct integrity dialogues and compliance training
worldwide. our bcgs form the basis for detailed internal regulations. the bcgs are binding for
allsiemensenergyemployeesworldwide.
our compliance system is designed to ensure that our business practices worldwide comply with
these guidelines and with applicable laws. to this end and to protect against compliance risks,
our compliance system is based on the three pillars of prevention, detection and response, and
covers in particular the areas of anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, antitrust, data privacy,
export control and human rights. we also require our suppliers and business partners to comply
with our standards of business conduct, including those relating to anti-corruption and fair
competition.
the global compliance structure combines strong governance at group level with the use of
qualified compliance officers who ensure that the compliance system is implemented worldwide.
since the corruption scandal at siemens ag in 2007/2008, a clear and unambiguous message has
been constantly conveyed that every single employee and especially management must comply
353
with the compliance rules. this message applies equally to the employees and management of
siemensenergy.
at siemens energy, a reliable compliance risk analysis is key to the success of the corporate
strategy and planned business objectives. therefore, our compliance risk management is an
essential element of the group wide erm program. for example, we have mandatory processes
and related tools for compliance due diligence of business partners, which are continuously
adapted to cover emerging risks. they support the siemens energy units in risk-based integrity
checks of business partners. at siemens energy we offer all employees and external third parties
protected reporting channels to report violations of external and internal rules. we follow up on
any indication of a violation. we monitor, evaluate and improve the siemens energy compliance
systemonacontinuousbasis.
12.8 legal and administrative proceedings
in the ordinary course of business, we are involved in out-of-court disputes, litigation and
arbitration proceedings as well as administrative proceedings. frequently encountered situations
include claims based on alleged breach of contract (in particular claims from or against project
partners and customers in connection with delays, poor or non-performance), labor disputes,
antitrust issues, product liability and warranty claims as well as infringement or the validity of ip
rights. for more information on the related risks, see “3.4.1 we are subject to risks from disputes
and administrative, legal and arbitration proceedings which could result in penalties, damages
and loss of reputation.” and “3.4.4 our risk management and internal controls may not prevent
or detect compliance risks, which could result in investigations by authorities, fines, damage
claims, payment claims, the termination of relationships with customers or suppliers and even
governmental exclusion from businesses (blacklisting) as well as reputational damage. further,
our internal controls could fail to detect business risks in time or at all.”. except for the
proceedings described below, neither the company nor any companies of the siemens energy

this includes claims brought against siemens in connection with an alleged anti-competitive
arrangementbetweenapril 1988andapril 2004in thefield ofgas-insulated switchgear inisrael.
in september 2013, the israeli antitrust authority concluded that siemens ag was a party to an
illegal restrictive arrangement regarding the israeli gas-insulated switchgear market between
1988 and 2004, with an interruption from october 1999 to february 2002. siemens ag appealed
againstthisdecisioninmay2014.
based on the above mentioned conclusion of the israeli antitrust authority, two electricity
consumer groups filed motions to certify a class action for cartel damages against a number of
companies including siemens ag with an israeli state court in september 2013. one of the class
actions was dismissed by the court in the fiscal year 2015. the remaining class action seeks
compensation for alleged damages amounting to ils 2.8 billion (as of september 30, 2019
equivalent to € 739 million). in addition, the israel electric corporation filed at the end of
december 2013 with an israeli state court a separate ils 3.8 billion (as of september 30, 2019
equivalent to € 997 million) claim for damages against siemens ag and other companies that

a reverse carve-out, i.e., the businesses within a regional company that remains with siemens

legalentity.
as a result, legal proceedings against such regional company arising in connection with business
activities that were previously conducted by such regional company and that do not pertain to
the siemens energy business will remain with such regional company, which is now part of
siemens energy. siemens energy and siemens group have reached agreements to allocate the
resulting financial risks in accordance with the separation of the business activities. however, it
cannot be excluded at this stage that, as a result of those legal proceedings, such regional
company might also be (temporarily or permanently) barred from conducting certain or any

12.8.2.2 claimsbasedonawindpowerplantprojectingermany
adwen gmbh (a subsidiary of sgre) was party to a proceeding pending before the dispute
adjudication board based in hamburg (“dab”), which concerns claims and counterclaims of
adwen gmbh (including adwen’s former shareholder areva, s.a.) and one of its customers
relating to a wind power plant project in germany. in june 2019, the dab resolved that adwen
gmbh is responsible for the remediation of certain defects, providing different deadlines (until
march 2020) for the remediation. at the same time, the dab awarded certain monetary
payments to adwen gmbh for unpaid invoices and as compensation for delays and project
disruptions. before the resolutions became legally binding, both parties agreed to start a
negotiation period (for mediation). with effect as of august 15, 2020, the parties entered into a
final settlement agreement. in such settlement agreement, the parties have agreed that the dab
decisions shall be final and binding and have specified how such decisions shall be implemented.
in addition, the agreement includes certain rules regarding the commercial relationship among
the parties going forward as well as the settlement of their claims regarding alleged defects of

due to problems with the execution of contracts, sgre may negotiate variations to the contract

the end of 2019, the customer alleged that sgre has delayed the project and is claiming

on july 31, 2020, general electric company (“ge”) filed intellectual property related lawsuits
against sgre entities with the district court (landgericht) in düsseldorf, germany, and before
the u.s. international trade commission (“itc”) asserting a violation of two patents with regard
to certain variable speed wind turbine generatorsandcomponents. thegermanlawsuit seeksan
injunction against sgre, mainly in relation to the manufacturing, offering and marketing of the
relevant wind turbine generators and components in germany, and financial compensation for
any (alleged) infringing action performed after july 15, 2020. the u.s. itc complaint seeks an
exclusion order against sgre’s importation of certain wind turbine equipment into the united
states.
should the complainant be successful, the financial burden to sgre could be significant. there is
the risk that sgre will not be able to complete projects or to win new projects for which the
affected wind turbine generators or components are required in germany and/or the united
states, or will only be able to do so at a higher cost (e.g., if it had to resort to alternative
generators or components). furthermore, if ge’s patents were found to be valid and infringed
upon by sgre, sgre could be forced to obtain a license from ge. sgre will be defending against
ge’s claims. in addition, sgre has launched an opposition appeal before the european patent
office in munich, germany, against the european patent which is the basis of the german
lawsuit;aresolutionontheappealisstillpending.
it cannot be excluded that sgre will be involved in further disputes of such kind in individual

agreement amounting to a total of € 2.5 billion (taken together), originally with
commerzbank aktiengesellschaft, banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria, s.a. (“bbva”) and bnp
paribas s.a. surcursal en españa acting as coordinating bookrunners and mandated lead
arrangers. this agreement replaced a former € 750 million multi-currency syndicated credit
facility agreement entered into in the fiscal year 2017 by gamesa, which had remained unused,
and several stand-alone financing arrangements on the sgre subsidiary and project level. the
2017facilitywasdeemedinsufficientfortheneedofthemuchlargermergedcompanysgres.a.
the 2018 credit facilities agreement included a fully-drawn term loan tranche of € 500 million,
which was initially set to mature on may 30, 2021, and a multi-currency, revolving credit line
tranche of € 2.0 billion initially maturing on may 30, 2023, with two one-year extension options.
asofseptember30,2019,andseptember30,2018,€500million and€700million, respectively,
had been drawn under these facilities (on aggregate). the revolving credit facility could be used
for general corporate purposes and the term facility could be used to refinance outstanding
debt. the facilities agreement was based on the loan market association investment grade
template facility with a 0% floor, a margin grid linked to the ratio of net financial debt and
ebitda,andwithnofinancialcovenants.intheeventthatanypersonorgroupofpersonsacting
in concert (a) owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the equity share capital or voting
rights of sgre s.a.; or (b) has the right to appoint the majority of the members of sgre s.a.’s
board of directors, and therefore acquires control over sgre s.a., each of the participating
financial institutions may negotiate with sgre s.a. in good faith for a period of 30 days
regarding the maintenance of the financial institution’s commitments under the facilities
agreement. in the event that an agreement is not reached, thefinancial institution(s) in question
may cancel all or part of its/their commitments and require full or partial prepayment of their
participationinthefinancing.
on december 19, 2019, sgre amended and extended this € 2.5 billion syndicated loan by an
amendment and restatement agreement, extending the maturity dates of the € 500 million loan
and the € 2 billion revolving tranche to december 19, 2022 and december 19, 2024, respectively.
the maturity of the € 2 billion revolving tranche may be extended by one further year on the
first and second anniversary of the signature of the agreement if sgre solicits the extension,
subject to a favorable decision of the banks. besides the original banks mentioned above,
citigroup global markets limited and banco santander, s.a. (“santander”) act under the
amended and restated facility agreement as coordinators. sgre announcedthat it would use the
funds to finance recurring activity. as part of the refinancing, sgre was able to secure more
flexible conditions due to its investment grade credit rating, reducing restrictions on loans out,
third-party guarantees and others. in addition, the pricing of this syndicated loan is tied to
sustainability (i.e., environmental social and corporate governance) criteria, in line with sgre’s
new “green” financing strategy. thus, this transaction constitutes sgre’s first “green” financing
facility. in addition, the amended and restated agreement also clarified that the transfer of
siemens ag’sinterest in sgres.a. tosiemensenergyaginconnectionwiththespin-off will not
constituteachangeofcontrolforpurposesoftheagreement,providedthatnothirdparty(i.e.,a
359
party other than siemens ag or siemens energy ag) holds direct or indirect control over sgre
s.a. similar language has been included in all financing facilities (bilateral agreements, including
thosementionedbelow)whereverchange-of-controllanguageiscontemplated.
in march and may 2019, sgre s.a. signed new bilateral credit lines at a variable rate with bbva,
santander,sociétégénérale,bnpparibasandcaixabankamountingto€512millionintotal,of
which € 412 million matured in 2020 and were extended until 2021. as of june 30, 2020, sgre
had not drawn any amount related to these credit lines. these credit lines are senior unsecured
lines, with pari passu, cross-default and no covenants attached. in may 2020, additional bilateral
credit lines with same-tenor terms and structure were signed with commerzbank
aktiengesellschaft and kutxabank, adding up to € 125 million. in july 2020, sgre s.a. increased
the bilateral credit line with santander included in the€512million from €100million to€150
million.
in addition, sgre has entered into agreements with several financial institutions regarding
so-called “green” guarantee lines. in a deal arranged with bnp paribas, the company converted
a€240million guaranteelineintoa“green”lineandsignedanadditionallinefor€110million

worldwidebusinessofmanufacturingonshoreandoffshorewindturbinegenerators.inaddition,
in early january 2020 sgre extended a guarantee line from danske bank to € 150 million (from
an initial € 100 million) and included sdg criteria. likewise, sgre signed and included similar
conditions for a new € 140 million guarantee from mizuho bank europe n.v. in january 2020.
moreover, at the end of october 2019, sgre arranged sustainable foreign exchange hedging
contracts in a landmark transaction coordinated with bnp paribas. on sgre’s account, the
transaction represents another significant step in its commitment to sustainable development
across all its activities, with which sgrehasconvertedanotional total of€174million inforeign
currency exchange hedging deals to “green” transactions. the derivatives are used not only to
hedge the foreign exchange exposure of selling offshore wind turbines in taiwan (a renewable
energy project), but also have an impact on the sdg targets related to “climate action”, and
“affordable and clean energy”. in addition, bnp paribas is committing to reinvest any premium
inareforestationprojectinspain.
on may 18, 2019, sgre signed a sustainability-linked syndicated bank guarantee line for up to
€ 600 million to cover the construction of wind turbines for hornsea two, the largest offshore
wind power plant to be announced to date. located in the north sea and owned by danish
utility company ørsted, the power plant will consist of 165 sgre wind turbines (with a total of
1.4 gw). bnp paribas lead managed the deal, in which bbva, mizuho and santander also
participated. under this agreement, the company will pay a premium in the event that it fails to
achieve the defined esg targets; otherwise, the premium will be paid by bnp paribas, together
with bbva and santander. in either case, the established premium on the deal will be used to

12.9.4 agreementswithsiemens
until spin-off completion, we had various relationships with siemens in the past and will
continue to have, modified and reduced, relationships with siemens in the future. in particular,
we received certain services relating to human resources, real estate, it, ip, legal, compliance,
procurement, export control and customs, treasury and other areas and were part of the cash
management system and global insurance coverage of siemens. a limited number of services in
some areas will partially continue for a transition period after the spin-off completion, in other
areas we have already built up our own resources. for further details see “18.1 transactions and

13 regulatory environment
at our main production sites in europe (germany, uk, spain, sweden, hungary and the czech
republic), usa, canada, china, brazil and mexico, we develop and manufacture products,
components, systems and solutions for customers who are active across the entire energy value
chain from generation, to transmission and distribution. our product portfolio includes
switchgear, transformers and high-voltage components (see “12.3.1 transmission division”),
compressors, aero-derivative and small industrial gas turbines as well as subsea products (see
“12.3.3 industrial applications division”), gas and steam turbines (see “12.3.2 generation
division”) as well as renewable energies such as wind turbines for onshore and offshore wind
power plants (see “12.4 sgre segment”). we sell these products and provide our solutions and
servicesinnearlyeverycountryontheglobe.
our business and operations are affected by various national and international rules, regulations
and standards. at the outset, this concerns requirements related to the production of our
products at our global sites. production regulation includes not only permit requirements for our
production facilities, specific equipment or production methods, but also environmental as well
as health and safety standards. in addition to our production process also our products as such
are subject to regulation, for example technical design specifications. some rules are directly
applicabletoourproductionandproducts,othersarerathercustomer-ormarket-related,suchas
where customers as operators of our products have to comply with environmental standards or
where climate protection policies aim at the decarbonization of energy markets. this regulation
indirectly also affects our production processes and/or our products. in addition, the sale of our
products to customers, particularly customers abroad, is subject to certain market access
regulations, like export control laws. finally, we must abide by laws applicable to all types of
entities regardless of their specific business, e.g., data privacy and competition law. all of these
rules, regulations and standards are subject to frequent, sometimes unpredictable, changes and
are supervised by the relevant authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our
business.
we have implemented management systems that are designed to ensure compliance with all
these requirements and we have in most cases obtained certifications of these systems regarding
quality (iso 9001), environmental protection (iso 14001), occupational health and safety (ohsas
18001/iso 45001) as well as in some cases certifications of specific aspects of our production or
location of work, such as energy management (iso 50001), welding workshops (iso 3834),
laboratories (iso 17025) or safety certificates for conducting our activities on our clients’
premises. on the one hand, these efforts contribute to our overall quality and compliance goals
and,ontheotherhand,theyalsofulfillourclients’basicconditionsforcooperationandbusiness.
13.1 production regulations
13.1.1 generalpermitandstatutoryrequirementsforindustrialinstallations
the manufacturing of our products depends on permits, approvals and other governmental
authorizations and must comply with statutory requirements. on a regular basis, the
construction, operation and/or material alteration of industrial installations requires a
comprehensive permit (integrated permit) or a set of different permits which take into account
building and planning law, operational safety as well as environmental impacts such as pollutant
andnoiseemissions,vibrationsandcomparableharmfuleffects.
additional regulations often apply to the operation and production processes in such
installations regarding the materials used for the production processes (for instance, chemicals)
as well as water discharge, waste disposal and air emissions. although the standards of
production regulations, requirements and restrictions differ in detail to a certain extent in the
countries in which we manufacture our products, the basic principles are generally comparable.
however, we do not produce all of our products at all of our main production sites. therefore,
some specific aspects of production regulation are only relevant for our production processes in
specificjurisdictions.
362
13.1.2 emissioncontrolregulations
our production processes generate different types of emissions including pollutants, noise
emissions, vibrations, odors and polluted waters. statutory requirements limit the extent of
permitted emissions and require us to take technical precautions to avoid harmful effects of our
installations on the environment and not endanger or cause significant disadvantages or
nuisancestothegeneralpublicorneighborhood.

inserts) of generators that we produce at several global sites. synthetic resin is generally a source
of strong odors. for that reason, these types of treatment plants often require a permit under
local emission control regulations, for example, under the german federal emission control act
(bundes-immissionsschutzgesetz, “bimschg”) in connection with the fourth ordinance for the
implementation of the federal emission control act (verordnung über genehmigungsbedürftige
anlagen, “4. bimschv”) at our german sites, in particular, in erfurt and muelheim an der ruhr,
or under the clean air act (“caa”) for our u.s. sites in charlotte and fort payne. in other
jurisdictions, a separate permit is not required but the synthetic resin emissions from our
production process must comply with specific thresholds, for instance in china under the
integrated emission standard for air pollutants (gb16297:1996). in brazil, environmental permits
also include limits for odor emissions that extend beyond the respective industrial property.
similarly, the coating of objects with metallic protective layers or plasma at our german sites in
berlin and duisburg and our u.s. site in charlotte also require a permit under the 4. bimschv or
thecaa,respectively. equivalentpermitrequirementsorregulationsoftenalsoapplyunderlocal
law for the coating of gas-powered engines as well as for impregnation of some transformer
componentsproducedatoursitesglobally.
the manufacturing of rotor blades by sgre at several production locations including spain, the
uk, usa, china, denmark and india involves the saturation of fiberglass components of the
bladeswithliquidepoxyresins,whichcausesdifferentairemissions,inparticular,volatileorganic
compounds. such environmental impacts are either subject to permit requirements or statutory
provisions under local emission control regulations, such as the environmental permitting
regulations 2018 (england and wales), the caa and related state regulations in the usa or the
respective environmental protection and air prevention and control of pollution acts in china,
denmark and india. further permit requirements apply to the use of epoxy adhesive during
assemblyofthebladeshellsbecauseoftheuseoforganicsolventsintheseadhesives.
13.1.2.2 operationofcoolingsystems
waste heat generated during our production processes is removed by cooling systems. these
cooling systems are prone to contamination (legionella bacteria), which could generally be
distributedintheenvironmentinthecourseofevaporation.inordertoensurethattechnicaland
organizational measures are implemented to avoid the emission oflegionella bacteria, theforty-
second ordinance implementing the federal emission control act on evaporative cooling
systems, cooling towers and wet separators (verordnung über verdunstungskühlanlagen,
kühltürme und nassabscheider, 42. bimschv) requires us to permanently monitor and report the
legionella concentrations of the cooling systems that we operate. if we exceed the statutory
thresholds, we have to take remedial measures and inform the authority accordingly. in brazil,
the national health surveillance agency ordinance 3523/1998 and resolution 09/2003 set similar
control and monitoring requirements. in china the standard hg/t 4323-2012 applies to the
detection and enumeration of legionella in circulating cooling water with reference to the
requirementsunderis011731:1998andis011731-2:2004.
13.1.2.3 operationofpowerplants
wealsooperatepowerplants(cogenerationunits)atsomeofoursites, forinstanceinmuelheim
an der ruhr, germany, to produce part of the electricity required for our manufacturing process.
363
in germany, the construction, operation and material alteration of such power plants requires a
permit under bimschg in connection with 4. bimschv and the forty-fourth ordinance
implementing the federal emission control act on medium-sized combustion plants
(verordnung über mittelgroße feuerungsanlagen, “44. bimschv”), which implements the
requirements of directive (eu) 2015/2193 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into
the air from medium combustion plants. equivalent permit requirements, statutory emission
limitations or air quality standards apply to several of our other production sites, such as under
the caa and related legislation in the usa or the environmental protection act in canada. in
china,theenvironmentalprotectionlawsetsgeneralstandardsofenvironmentalprotection,the
prevention and control of atmospheric pollution law prevents and controls air pollution to
ensure public health and a pollution discharge permit is required for power plants under the
regulation on pollution discharge permitting. in brazil, prevention and control of air pollution
and permit procedures are governed by the national air pollution control program and
resolutions of the national environment council (“conama”), for example for our operations in
thenorthregion.
13.1.2.4 testingfacilities
we operate testing facilities (prüfstände) for our products in different jurisdictions. such testing
covers different stages of a product from development up to acceptance testing. depending on
the proprieties of our testing facilities we may have to obtain specific permits or comply with
certain statutory obligations. for example, our testing facilities at some of our sites, e.g., in
germany (like in berlin and ludwigsfelde), uk, sweden, and the czech republic require a permit
under local emission control law because of the high rated thermal output
(feuerungswärmeleistung) of the tested components. another permit may be required for
storagefacilities forfuelsthatweuseduringturbinetesting.whereourstoragecapacityexceeds
certain thresholds, we must fulfil increased operator obligations in accordance with directive
2012/18/eu on the control of major-accident hazards (seveso iii), which includes implementation
of a major-accident prevention policy for things like the liquid gas storage tank at our swedish
siteinfinspång.
regarding ghg emissions produced in particular during testing activities, the european emission
trading system (“eu ets”), established by directive (ec) 2003/87 as last revised by directive (eu)
2018/410, requires us to provide emission certificates (“euas”) to the competent authority, in
particular for our cogeneration units, but also for the combustion process during the testing of
our gas turbines. in the energy sector allowances have already been auctioned since 2013. in
germany, these requirements are transposed into the ghg emissions trading act (treibhausgas-
emissionshandelsgesetz). in china, the environmental protection tax law aims at a reduction of
pollutantsbyimposingtaxesonthedischargeofspecifiedpollutants.
in addition, our test devices can be connected to water breaks, which cause significant noise
emissions. suchnoiseemissionsaresubjecttopreventionandcontrollawsapplicabletoallofour
production sites. under directive (ec) 2002/49 on environmental noise (“end”) each eu member
statemustidentifynoisepollutionlevels(noisemapping).determininglimitsandtargetvaluesas
well as appropriate noise protection measures, however, remains at the discretion of the
competent member state authorities. our industrial installations are also recorded in such noise
maps. where our industrial installations jointly with others cause harmful noise emissions, we
mayberequiredtoimplementcorrectivemeasures,suchasnoiseprotectionorreductionofnoise
emissions during the night. in germany, the end was implemented by an amendment to the
bimschg. further noise prevention and control laws that either set permit requirements or
statutory thresholds include the u.s. noise control act, the chinese noise pollution prevention
law,andbrazilianconamaresolution1,ofmarch8,1990,onemissionsofnoisefromindustrial
activity.
sgre does not require separate permits for component testing during product development or
manufacturing and assembly, but only for full turbine (prototype) testing, which is typically
364
conducted in denmark (høvsøre and østerild) or in spain (alaiz). for both countries, a local
building permit is requiredandin denmarksgrealso hastoobtainaprototypecertificate under
thedanishexecutiveorderno.73ofjanuary25,2013.
13.1.3 environmentalresponsibilitiesrelatedtoourproductionprocess
13.1.3.1 useofwatersanddischargeofprocessandwastewater
the resources and products we require to manufacture our own products as well as the devices
we operate to test our products are in partalso subject toregulation. forexample, for thewater
offtake from rivers and wells to use as process waters in our cooling systems, as at our german
site in nuremberg, requires a permit under the german federal water act
(wasserhaushaltsgesetz, “whg”). the same applies to the discharge of wastewater into
sewerage facilities, for example under the environmental permitting (england and wales)
regulations 2016 for our uk sites. wastewater standards for our u.s. production sites have been
set by the environmental protection agency (“epa”) under the clean water act, which also
regulates the discharge of pollutants into water and water quality standards. our chinese sites
requireawastewaterdischargepermitunderthepreventionandcontrolofwaterpollutionlaw.
in brazil, the national water resources policy (federal law 9433/1997) sets general standards for
water use and conama resolutions 357/2005 and 430/2011 regulate the discharge of pollutants
into water. additional water law permits are required for the operation of wastewater systems
such as our oil separators. since some of the substances we work with are hazardous to waters,
water laws also set prevention, control and monitoring obligations. also sgre’s production sites
depend on water usage and/or wastewater discharge permits in addition to the aforementioned
legislation, for instance in spain under the royal legislative decree no. 1/2001 or in india under
thewaterpreventionandcontrolofpollutionact.
13.1.3.2 useofhazardoussubstances
another aspect of protection against adverse health and safety effects concerns chemicals and
hazardous substances. numerous restrictions and requirements apply with respect to the access
to and the use of chemicals and hazardous substances required for our manufacturing or
commissioning processes. for example, as a global process we successfully manage the
production, dispatch, use and disposal of a special pickling chemical required during the
commissioning of heat recovery boilers. in the eu these issues are covered by regulation (ec)
1907/2006 (“reach”). under regulation (ec) 1272/2008 (“clp regulation”) we also have to
ensurethatsubstancesareclassified,labeledandpackagedinaccordancewiththehazarddegree
of their properties. this particularly concerns lacquers, resins and oils that we use for coating or
as lubricant for product components. for the enforcement of reach and the clp regulation,
supplementary provisions have been enacted, such as in the german chemicals act
(chemikaliengesetz). the use of some chemicals has generally been prohibited altogether, for
instance under the german chemicals prohibition ordinance (chemikalien-verbotsverordnung).
similarly in the usa, the toxic substances control act (“tsca”) addresses, inter alia, the
importation, use and disposal of specific chemicals. in china, the dangerous chemicals
management law addresses risks in connection with production, use, operation and
transportation of hazardous chemicals. in mexico, the general law of ecological balance and
environmental protection (ley general del equilibrio ecológico y la protección al ambiente,
“lgeepa”) concerns the handling of substances with flammable, explosive, toxic, reactive,
radioactive, corrosive or biological properties in amounts endangering the environment or
generalpopulation.
13.1.3.3 useofradiationdevices,laserandothertestingequipment
we have obtained further permits related to the development, manufacture, testing and
inspection of our products, including permits under the german radiation protection ordinance
(strahlenschutzverordnung) or the swedish radiation protection act (sfs 1988:220) concerning
the operation of portable andstationary non-medical x-rayunits (röntgeneinrichtungen) for the
365
non-destructive testing of pipes and flanges, among other things. comparable permit
requirements for our u.s. sites have been set by the nuclear regulatory commission, which
ensures the safe use of radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes. under the ionizing
radiation regulations 2017 in the uk we have to register radiation devices used mainly for
testing of welding of pipes with the competent authority along with certificates of testing. sgre
also uses radiation and laser equipment for testing at blade production facilities in spain, uk,
denmark, china and the usa, in particular for detection of defects. this equipment also requires
apermitand/oranotificationtothecompetentauthorityunderlocallaw.
requirements for pressure equipment that we use for leakage tests of vessels must comply with
directive (eu) 2014/68 on pressure equipment and the german pressure equipment ordinance. a
permitunderthegermanexplosivesact(sprengstoffgesetz)allowsustouseexplosivesubstances
as propellant in isolating switches of switchgears during research activities in berlin and
nuremberg in case a short circuit is produced. we also operate sources of non-ionizing radiation,
i.e., laser for powder welding during our additive manufacturing processes or for the curing of
edges and surfaces as well as precise metering of lengths. in some jurisdiction like in the uk we
require a permit for some of these activities, but even where these installations do not require a
permit (like under the german bimschg) we are nonetheless obligated to operate any such
installation in a manner avoiding harmful effects on the environment. for our non-destructive
testing using gammagraphy at our brazilian sites in jundiaí and santa bárbara d’oeste we must
comply with the standards set by the national nuclear energy commission on general
radiological protection as well as safety requirements and radiological protection for industrial
radiographyservices.
13.1.3.4 wasteproductionandmanagement
during our manufacturing process we also produce different kinds of waste including packaging
and industrial waste. waste laws in all the countries in which we operate generally require us to
reduce waste and to dispose of the different types of waste in a manner consistent with its
properties so that it does not endanger human health or harm the environment. in europe,
directive(ec)2008/98aslastamendedbydirective(eu)2018/851(“wasteframeworkdirective”)
requires eu member states to take appropriate measures in this regard. in addition to the waste
framework directive, directive (ec) 94/62 as last amended by directive (eu) 2018/852 (packaging
waste directive) contains supplementary producer responsibility regimes applicable to our
business activities. different member states’ laws transpose these eu requirements, such as the
waste management act (kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz) and the packaging act (verpackungsgesetz
2019) in germany or the environmental code (sfs 1998:808) in sweden. under the eu circular
economy package 2018, the european union also adopted directive (eu) 2019/904 on the
reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment. this directive, which has
to be implemented in the member states by july 3, 2021, aims to prevent and reduce the impact
on the environment of certain plastic products that are usually used only once or for a short
period of time, and to promote a transition to a circular economy by introducing a mix of
measures tailored to the products covered by the directive, including an eu-wide ban on
single-useplasticproductswheneveralternativesareavailable.propermanagementofhazardous

each type of waste and activity that, inter alia, standardize classification, storage, labeling,
transport and disposal of waste, in particular, federal law no. 12305 regarding the prevention

disposal. transport and disposal of hazardous waste also require a special permit of the local
environmental authority. for our chinese sites, the prevention and control of solid waste
pollutionlawsetsstandardsforpreventionandcontrolofpollutionbysolidwaste.
13.1.3.5 liabilityforenvironmentalimpacts
due to the historical and current industrial use of some of the production sites that we own and
occupy, it cannot be excluded that we may be held liable to investigate and remediate present
366
environmental impacts. there are, however, no globally applicable principles or even a european
harmonized framework on environmental liability. under the german federal soil protection act
(bundes-bodenschutzgesetz),forexample,wemaybeheldliableirrespectiveofwhetherwehave
caused the contamination. where an environmental damage occurs that was caused by our
business activities that are potentially dangerous to the environment we may be held liable
under the german federal environmental damage act (umweltschadensgesetz). in the usa, the
comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (superfund law) and
similar state statutes impose retroactive, strict, and joint and several liability on current and prior
owners or operators of contaminated sites, and on parties that disposed of or transported
hazardous substances to contaminated sites. in brazil, federal law 6938/1981 requires polluters
toremedyenvironmental damagescausedandconamaresolution420establishesdirectives for
the environmental management of contaminated areas. in mexico, lgeepa holds persons or
entities liable for actions or omissions that cause damage to the environment and requires them
totakeoutinsurancetoremediateenvironmentaldamage.
13.1.3.6 transportationofdangerousgoods
some of our products also contain or require hazardous substances with toxic or other defined
properties, such as oils, nitrogen or battery acid. we transport such dangerous goods to our
customers either as an integral part of our products or separately for later use in our products.
any transport of dangerous goods is subject to special regulations, such as segregation
requirements. these special regulations can be found for instance in the european agreement
concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road, the international maritime
dangerous goods code, the iata dangerous goods regulations for air freight, and furthermore
under the dangerous goods transportation act (gefahrgutbeförderungsgesetz) in germany, the
hazardous material transportation act in the usa or national land transport agency
resolutions 5848/2019 and 5232/2017 on transport of dangerous products in brazil. we ensure
fulfillment of specific safety requirements set out by these regulations, among other things
regardinglabellingandprotectionmeasuresbyaspecificsystem.
13.1.4 healthandsafetyregulations
we are subject to health and safety laws, rules and regulations not only regarding the sites we
operate but also at a given customer location, such as when we construct complete and
functional power plants in any given country around the globe. compliance with the applicable
requirements is paramount in order to be able to fulfill our contractual obligations vis-à-vis the
customer.
on the international level, the united nations sdgs, inter alia, provide a blueprint to achieve
better health and well-being standards. the occupational safety and health act (“osh act”) in
the usa, the federal regulation onsafetyandhealthin theworkin mexico (stps) anddirective
(eec) 89/391 on the safety and health of workers at work in the european union each promote
the improvement of the working environment to protect workers’ health and safety. over the
years, various standards have been adopted for a number of different areas of occupational
health and safety in the workplace (such as work equipment, personal protective equipment,
display screen equipment, the manual handling of loads and the handling of hazardous
substances). in some countries standards are directly implemented by law or decrees of the
competent ministries, such as in mexico where 41 official standards on occupational safety and
health apply. other countries have empowered trade associations to set specific standards which
are sometimes legally binding, in particular in germany, or non-binding but still preserved as
industrystandards,inparticularintheusa.
ingermany,generalhealthandsafetyrequirementsforemployeesarelaiddownbytheworking
conditions act (arbeitsschutzgesetz), the occupational safety act (arbeitssicherheitsgesetz) and
the ordinance on industrial safety (betriebssicherheitsverordnung). for the provision and use of
working equipment, the product safety act (produktsicherheitsgesetz) applies, along with the
ordinance on health and safety at work (arbeitsstättenverordnung) and the ordinance on
367
construction sites (baustellenverordnung). as regards exposure to hazardous substances, the
ordinance on hazardous substances (gefahrstoffverordnung) and the technical rules for
hazardous substances (technische regel für gefahrstoffe 900) set out limits for workplaces. we
have also obtained a permit under the radiation protection act (strahlenschutzgesetz) in order
toabletosendouremployeesinto nuclearfacilities operatedbythirdpartieswheretheymaybe
exposed to radiation of more than 1 millisievert per calendar year. all of these requirements are
further specified by german trade associations (berufsgenossenschaften) in their accident
prevention regulations (unfallverhütungsvorschriften), which also address specific health and
safetyrisksofcertainbusinessessuchasinspectionofwindpowersystemsbysgre.
in china, a set of health and safety regulations also applies to ensure work safety, including the
china safety production law and more specific laws covering aspects of disease prevention, use
ofchemicals,firepreventionandspecialequipmentsafety.
we review our work safety requirements on a regular basis and aim at improving the relevant
workplace conditions and operations to reduce the risks of injuries to a minimum. we are aware
oftheimpactthatworkhasonhealth,safetyandtheenvironment.wearecommittedtocontrol
and mitigate this impact, for instance, by reducing the water, energy consumption and co
2
emissions in our manufacturing processes and by offering various health and safety initiatives at
oursites.
in addition to statutory regulations, all our main production facilities also comply with different
non-binding but internationally recognized standards. this includes international occupational
safety management standards. it is anticipated that current audits will be completed in line with
the requirements of iso 45001. these standards confirm that we anticipate and avoid risks for
consumers, make employees aware of dangers in order to reduce accidents, and educate them in
environmentally-friendlypractices(forexample,reducingwasteandhazardoussubstances).
13.1.5 cybersecurityregulation
most of our products, in particular grid and generation related products, form part of a greater
infrastructure that supplies the general public with electricity. in most countries this is critical
infrastructure and therefore has to be protected against cyberattacks. therefore, operators of
this infrastructure are regularly obligated to take adequate organizational and technical
measures to avoid disruptions of their it systems, components or processes that are essential for
the critical infrastructure’s operation. they also must ensure the availability of these systems and
data,theintegrityaswellastheconfidentialityofprocessedinformation.
in the eu, directive (eu) 2016/1148 on cyber security of network and information systems (“nis
directive”)proposesawide-rangingsetofmeasurestoboostthelevelofsecurityofnetworkand
informationsystemstosecureservicesvitaltotheeueconomyandsociety,includingprovidersof
essential services in critical sectors such as energy. it aims to ensure that eu countries are well-
prepared and ready to handle cyberattacks in particular by the adoption of national cyber
security strategies and obligations of essential services providers and digital service providers, to
ensure that they take appropriate security measures and notify the relevant national authorities
about serious incidents. regulation (eu) 2019/881 on the european union agency for
cybersecurity (“enisa”) mandates enisa to support eu member states regarding cyber security
risks and aims at the certification of several critical infrastructure sectors. a framework for eu
cybersecuritycertificationforproducts,processesandservicesiscurrentlybeingdeveloped.
in germany, the relevant framework comprises the act on the federal office for information
security (gesetz über das bundesamt für sicherheit in der informationstechnik), with specific
obligations for operators of energy supply networks and energy systems set out in the energy
industry act (energiewirtschaftsgesetz) and minimum standards for cyber security contained in a
safety catalogue published by the federal network agency (bundesnetzagentur, “bnetza”)
including the implementation and certification of an information security management system
according toiso/iec 27001.similar systems arerequiredbythenisguidancecollectionintheuk
368
and the standards regarding critical infrastructure protection set by the north american electric
reliability corporation (“nerc”) for canada and the usa. china is in the process of establishing
similar provisions based on a draft regulation on the protection of critical infrastructure.
however, the cybersecurity law of the people’s republic of china already requires operators of
critical information infrastructure who purchase network products or services to sign a security
and confidentiality agreement with the respective provider clarifying duties and responsibilities
for security and confidentiality. thresholds or criteria determining whether a certain installation
counts as critical infrastructure, however, vary between countries. for example, nerc’s standard
for the usa and canada defines 75 mw as threshold for generating plants to count as critical
infrastructure whereas the german ordinance for the determination of critical infrastructures
according to the act on the federal office for information security (bsi-kritisverordnung) sets a
thresholdof420mw.
since we regularly only manufacture products that are built into critical infrastructure or only
operate plants on behalf of our business partners, we are in most cases not directly responsible
under the respective regulations. indirectly, however, we must comply with cyber security
regulations to be able to develop and produce components that can safely be used in these
systems. accordingly some of our systems are also included under a din iso/iec 27001
certification stipulating that we develop our products in a responsible manner consistent with
bestpractice.thisaspectisalsoatopicinthecurrentdiscussionsregardingabillonanitsecurity
act 2.0 (it-sicherheitsgesetz 2.0) of may 7, 2020, which is supposed to establish declarations of
trustworthiness regarding the supplier industry of operators of critical infrastructure in germany.
other countries have already adopted specific regulations regarding the supply chain of a critical
infrastructure. in the usa, presidential order no. 829 and the nerc standard cip-013-1 require
operatorsofbulkelectricsystemstoextendcybersecurityobligationstotheirsuppliersbywayof
contract.
for the industrial control systems (“ics”) that we produce, like sppa-t3000, the german federal
office for information security published (legally non-binding) recommendations for ics
manufacturers and integrators. the german federal office for information security recommends
the implementation of an information security management system and fulfilment of further
requirements that should be met during the process of planning and development of industrial
control systems. similarly, in the uk operators of critical infrastructure are required to specify
cybersecurityrequirementsfortheirsuppliers.
13.2 product regulations
13.2.1 design/constructionrequirements(productsafety,emissions,eco-design)
our products are subject to requirements relating to their technical design. in particular, our
products must comply with safety requirements which are laid down in numerousacts andwhich
contain both general safety requirements and requirements specific to certain products or
technologies, hazards or impacts. this legislation also provides certain requirements relating to
conformityassessmentproceduresandlabellingofourproducts.
13.2.1.1 generalproductsafety
product safety encompasses the safety of all products and services that we develop, manufacture
and/orsell. theymust meetapplicable statutory requirementsandofferstate-of-the-art safetyso
that they do not represent a hazard to life, health or property. in addition to our products being
technicallysafeintermsoftheirdesign,itisalsoessentialthatapreventiveproductsafetysystem
is in place that governs the organization, communication, responsibilities and reporting channels
established to ensure product safety and a rapid, professional response in the event of safety-
relatedproblems.
in the european union, products placed on the market must comply with all applicable
legislation (decision (ec) 768/2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products),
which is laid down in numerous acts relating to specific products. these acts mostly require the
369
manufacturer to carry out conformity assessment procedures as well. depending on the product,
the manufacturer can choose among several conformity assessment procedures. mostly, the
manufacturer can carry out such assessment himself. however, in certain cases (for instance with
regard to our pressure assembly system in power plants), the manufacturer has to involve
notified bodies. notified bodies must be established in a member state of the european union.
as a result of the uk leaving the european union on january 31, 2020 (“brexit”), notified bodies
which are established in the uk may no longer act as notified bodies and certificates issued by
them cease to be valid for products which we haveputonthemarketafter january31,2020.for
these products we must revert to another notified body established in the european union. as a
result of brexit there is a transitional period until december 31, 2020 in which the current
product-relatedrulescontinuetoapply.thismeansthatwemayexportourproductstotheukif
they comply with the applicable european requirements, notwithstanding the fact that these
products may need a certification by a notified body located in a member state of the european
union.
in china, our products must comply, in particular, with the china product quality law, according
to which industrial products that may be hazardous to health and safety shall conform to certain
standards or, in the absence of such standards, to minimum requirements for ensuring health of
the human body and safety of lives and property. a variety of actors has adopted standards
(national, regional, local standards; industry, enterprise, association standards). in general,
national standards take precedence over all other standards. voluntary standards become
bindingbyreferenceinspecificlawsorregulations.
13.2.1.2 machinery
many of our products, such as gas and steam turbines, wind turbines, drilling rigs and hydrogen
solutions, are subject to machinery related safety legislation. in europe this legislation is laid
down in directive (ec) 2006/42 (the “machinery directive”). accordingly, we must design and
construct machinery so that it is fitted for its function and can be operated, adjusted and
maintained without putting persons at risk when these operations are carried out under the
conditionsforeseen,takingintoaccountreasonablyforeseeablemisuse.whenchoosingtechnical
solutions to fulfil these requirements, the machinery directive applies a three-step approach.
according to this concept, the manufacturer must first eliminate or reduce risks as far as possible
by applying safe design and construction methods, second take necessary protective measures in
relation to risks that cannot be eliminated and third inform users of residual risks. in addition,
the machinery directive requires ustodesignourproducts in suchaway thatrisks resulting from
the emission of airborne noise are reduced to the lowest level taking technical progress and the
availabilityofnoisereducingmethodsintoaccount.
in the u.s., the occupational health and safety administration (“osha”) has adopted
regulations on machine safety. in particular, we are required to provide one or more methods of
machine guarding (e.g., barrier guards,electronic safety devices) in ordertoprotect theoperator
and other employees in the machine area from hazards. in canada, as a general rule, machinery
must be free from hazards that pose a danger to a person or property. beyond such general
requirements most provinces and territories have issued comprehensive safety codes applying to
specific products such as electrical components and pressure equipment (see “13.2.1.3 electric
devices” and “13.2.1.4 pressure equipment” below). in brazil, the regulatory standards (norma
regulamentadora, “nr”) set minimum requirements regarding the safety of specific products.
the general standard nr 12 on machinery and work equipment safety requires that industrial
machinery be free from recognized hazards likely to endanger health and physical integrity of
employeesanddesignedtopreventaccidentsdespitepotentialdefects(failsafeprinciple).
13.2.1.3 electricdevices
some parts of power transformers and other electronic devices we manufacture are subject to
requirements of directive (eu) 2014/35 on electrical equipment designed for use within certain
voltage limits (low voltage directive). this directive requires manufacturers to avoid
370
endangering health and safety of persons, domestic animals and property when electrical
equipmentis installed, maintained andused.thuswemustemploytechnicalmeasurestoprotect
persons and domestic animals (i) from hazards resulting from the electrical equipment (e.g.,
arising through contact with the equipment or from certain temperatures, arcs or radiation) and
(ii)againsthazardswhichmaybecausedbyexternalinfluencesontheelectricalequipment.
in the u.s., the electrical components we produce require approval by recognized testing
laboratories (29 cfr part 1910). electric equipment must generally be free from recognized
hazardsthatarelikelytocausedeathorseriousphysicalharmtoemployees,takingintoaccount,
among others, the mechanical strength and heating effects under all conditions of use. in
addition, state governments and local authorities have adopted as law the national electrical
code (“nec”). the nec covers the installation of electrical products for public or private use and
requires that certain electrical products (e.g., wires, cabinets and switches) meet the
requirements of specific standards. in particular, according to the nec all electrical components
mustbelisted,labelledorapprovedforinstallation.
in canada, electrical components have to be compliant with the electrical code of the canadian
standards association (“csa”) (csa c22.1-18) as implemented and amended by respective
provincial or territorial legislation. in particular any deviation from the standards laid down
requiresgovernmentalauthorization.
in brazil, electrical components have to comply with the specific national standard nr 10.
notably, they shall be designed to have overvoltage protection and discharging mechanisms.
some components, especially those used in fire sensitive surroundings and explosive
atmospheres, require certification by nationally recognized testing laboratories. such approval
involves determining whether theproductmeets therequirements ofapplicable safety standards
imposed by the national institute of metrology, standardization and industrial quality (instituto
nacionaldemetrologia,qualidadeetecnologia).
13.2.1.4 pressureequipment
our business also involves the delivery of assemblies which are covered, in europe, by directive
(eu) 2014/68 relating to pressure equipment (“ped”). typical assemblies we deliver to our
customers include, depending on design and application, steam generators (unfired, fired),
power piping, heat exchangers, pressure vessels, condensers, tanks, unpressurized vessels and air
receivers. as manufacturer of these products we are obliged to fulfil the requirements of the
ped. the ped stipulates essential safety requirements relating to the design, manufacturing and
materials used for the manufacture of pressure equipment in the ped’s scope. for some products
that we manufacture, like steam generators, the ped stipulates additional requirements and
requires us to calculate, design and construct such products to avoid or minimize risks of a
significant loss of containment from overheating. moreover, the ped stipulates specific
certificationrequirementswhichmayrequireustoinvolvenotifiedbodies.
in the u.s., the osha has defined a number of regulations which apply, among other things to
certain hydrogen containers and air receivers. the osha regulations refer to standards adopted
by the american society ofmechanical engineerscovering theconstruction ofpressure vessels. in
addition theoshactrequires employers toprovideaplaceofemployment freefrom recognized
hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to their employees. according to
aninterpretationletterfromtheoshathisobligationmayalsoapplytopressurevesselsusedfor

in canada, pressure vessels are subject to prior registration or authorization pursuant to local
legislation. the process includes disclosure of information on design, calculations and other
details. the authorities determine whether the product meets the requirements of applicable
safety standards imposed by the csa and the american standards institute. in particular, the
pressure equipment must be constructed to prevent unintentional release of contained fluid and
so that integrity assessments to determine its condition may be carried out. in china, the law on
the safety of special equipment requires that certain of our boilers, pressurevessels andpressure
371
piping elements be certified under a product certification scheme administered by the special
equipment licensing office of the state administration for market regulation. in brazil, boilers
and pressure vessels have to meet the additional standards described in nr 13. in particular, a
hydrostatictesthastobeconducted.
13.2.1.5 electromagneticcompatibility
our power transformers, wind turbines and other electric gear are also subject to requirements
relating to electromagnetic compatibility. in europe, these are laid down in directive (eu)
2014/30, according to which manufacturers must design and manufacture equipment to ensure
(i) that electromagnetic disturbance generated by equipment does not exceed the level above
which other equipment cannot operate as intended and (ii) that equipment is sufficiently
immune to electromagnetic disturbance created by other equipment. thereby the manufacturer
mustrespectthestateoftheart.fixedinstallations aresubjecttoanadditionalrequirementthat
they be installed applying good engineering practices. the federal communications commission
regulates the electromagnetic compatibility of products in the u.s. and has, to that end,
published a number of regulations (47 cfr part 15). our products must, in particular, be
authorized prior to initiation of marketing and must comply with specific limits for the emission
ofelectromagneticradiation.
13.2.1.6 explosiveatmospheres
some of our products constitute or are used in potentially explosive atmospheres, such as
hydrogen-based cooling systems, compressors and compressor strings, and industrial steam
turbines. in europe, directive (eu) 2014/34 relating to equipment and protective systems
intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres stipulates specific safety requirements for
these products. in particular we must, (i) if possible, prevent the formation of explosive
atmospheres which may be produced or released by equipment and by protective systems
themselves, (ii) prevent the ignition of explosive atmospheres and (iii) take measures to halt
immediately or to limit the effects of explosions which may occur despite the steps taken under
(i) and (ii). in the u.s., the nec also contains rules relating to equipment for use in explosive
atmospheres while in canada such rules are found in the canadian electrical code (see
“13.2.1.3electricdevices”above).
13.2.1.7 eco-designrequirements
someofourproductsarealsosubjecttoeco-designrequirementsandlegislationwhichgenerally
aims at reducing the ecological footprint of products. one aspect of this is to improve energy
efficiency of energy-using appliances, thereby contributing to lower co emissions. in europe,
2
directive (ec) 2009/125 and other legislation oblige manufacturers to consider eco-design
requirements at every stage of a product’s life cycle (raw materials, manufacturing, packaging,
distribution, installation, maintenance, use and end-of life). for certain power transformers we
produce, regulation (eu) 548/2014 stipulates specific requirements relating to minimum energy
performance and energy efficiency requirements (namely maximum load losses and maximum
no-load losses). in china, the energy conservation law promotes the improvement of energy

13.2.1.8 constructionproducts
regulation (eu) 302/2011 on construction products applies to certain products which will be
incorporated in a permanent manner in construction works. these must fulfil essential
characteristics laid down in harmonized technical rules. in addition, we must declare that our
products conform to this regulation and the relevant technical rules, and also that our products
have certain constancy of conformance with these requirements. depending on the product, we
may give such declarations ourselves or we must revert to notified bodies. this applies to certain
372

13.2.2 regulationofproductcontentandcomponents
certain chemicals and other contents of our products are subject to laws and regulations
governing their use, packaging, transport and disposal. in addition we are under certain
obligationstonotifyourcustomersofsuchcontentsinourproducts.
in the european union, the reach regulation provides a comprehensive legislative framework
for the manufacture and use of chemicals. it requires registration with the european chemicals
agency of all chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the european union in
quantities of more than one ton per annum. if there is no (pre) registration of the substance it is
impermissible to produce this chemical in the european union, to import or to use it (i.e., “no
data no market” principle). for substances that have been added to annex xiv of the reach
regulation, an authorization is required to continuously use them after the so-called “sunset
date”andit is uncertain whether theauthorities will providesuchauthorization. inaddition,the
use of substances listed in annex xiv of the reachregulation may be restricted in the future by
inclusion of these substances in annex xvii of the reach regulation. also, substances of very
high concern (“svhc”) may be listed on a so-called “candidate list” (“svhc list”). the svhc list
contains substances for potential inclusion into the list of annex xiv of the reach regulation.
we use anhydrides as a hardening agent in the production of many of our components for
electric systems which we produce from cast resin (e.g., generator components, cast resin
transformers, isolators and bushings). anhydrides have recently been included in the svhc list.
we must inform recipients pro-actively if our products contain svhc with a concentration of
≥0.1% weight by weight. under certain circumstances a notification to the european chemicals
agency is also required. further restrictions are found in national rules like in the german
chemicalsprohibitionordinance(chemikalien-verbotsverordnung).
our product line also includes air and gas-insulated switchgear which is often built into
substations orwind turbines. theinsulation gasusedis sf , which is aghg.asofthedateofthis

prospectus, no legal restrictions apply for the use of sf in our switchgear. public debate on this
6
matter includes a potential ban of the use of sf , which would prohibit us from using it in our
6
products in some countries or in general in the future. in light of this public debate, we have
pro-actively developed a product line which does not require the use of sf (blue portfolio). this
6
portfolio allows us to modernize and expand existing power grids in line with increased levels of
safety. many of our products, such as gear units, contain oil as cooling and lubricating agent. in
addition, certain of the fire extinguishing systems we produce use co as fire extinguishing
2
agent. these and other substances are considered dangerous under the clp regulation and we
are therefore subject to certain obligations with regard to their classification, labelling and
packaging.inaddition,wemustprovidetoourcustomersadequatesafetydatasheets.
in the u.s., the tsca is the primary chemicals management law. it requires epa to undertake risk
evaluations for chemicals made or used within the u.s. which are new or already listed in the

13.2.3 circulareconomy
our products are subject to general considerations of circular economy. in addition, our wind
turbines and transformers may in the future be subject to additional (specific) design
requirementswithaviewtoensuringefficientuseofresourcesandavoidanceofwaste.
373
in the european union, the eu commission published in 2015 its circular economy action plan
which aims at facilitating a transition towards a more sustainable model for economic
development. the action plan concerns circular economy over the entire life cycle of a product,
including the production phase, by proposing several initiatives and regulatory actions as well as
by identifying certain priority sectors. in 2019, the eu commission published its final circular
economy package summarizing the actions taken or envisaged in implementing the 2015 action
plan. in 2020, the eu commission published its new circular economy action plan which puts
emphasis on the roll out of a product policy framework to reduce waste and to ensure that the
european union has a well-functioning internal market for high quality secondary raw materials.
in particular the eu commission is planning to examine whether the european union should
develop specific eco-design requirements for wind turbines. with such requirements, the eu
commission aims at ensuring a circular economy of neodymium and other materials which the
european union considers as critical raw materials and which the eu commission expects will be
usedinlargerwindturbinesinthefuture.
in addition, the european union updated its waste framework directive (directive (ec) 2008/98)
in 2018 and obliged member states to manage waste containing significant amounts of critical
raw materials to the best extent possible (see “13.1.3.4 waste production and management”
above). this includes preventing that products which are the main sources of critical raw
materials become waste. member states must implement the updated directive into their
national laws by july 5, 2020. in germany, the federal government has published a draft law to
transpose the updated waste management directive into national law. as of the date of this
prospectus, the legislative procedure is ongoing. the draft envisages obligations for producers of
certain products to pay for the products’ recycling and further obligations to strengthen
producer responsibility. the german government can issue regulations to define the types of
products to which these obligations apply. our wind turbines consist of rotor blades made of
carbon-reinforced material which must be recycled in specific facilities after use. although there
has been a political debate in germany to oblige manufacturers of wind turbines or rotor blades
used therein to pay for the recycling of the blades, as of the date of this prospectus the german
government has not yet made a specific legislative proposal on this. france recently enacted a
rule (arrêté du 22 juin 2020 portant modification des prescriptions relatives aux installations de
productiond’électricité utilisant l’énergiemécaniqueduventauseind’uneinstallationsoumiseà
autorisation au titre de la rubrique 2980 de la législation des installations classées pour la
protection de l’environnement) stipulating stringent requirements for the recycling of existing
and the recyclability of new wind turbines, which are phased-in from july 1, 2020. in general,

in china, the circular economy promotion law stipulates general requirements for reduction,
reuse and recycling. in particular when we design products, we are obliged to make prior use of
materials anddesigningschemeswhichallowtheproductstoberecycled.withrespecttocertain
electric and electronic products we may not use certain toxic and harmful substances as
prohibitedbythestate.
in brazil, federal law 12305/2010 establishes the national solid waste policy which aims to
provide integrated and environmentally sound management of solid waste. this policy stipulates
the principle of joint responsibility of all agents involved in the life cycle of a product (e.g.,
manufacturers, importers, retailers, public authorities). therefore, they must minimize the
volume of solid waste and adopt practices to ensure that products are reintegrated into the
productioncycle.
13.3 regulations applicable to our customers’ operations
when using the products we produce, our customers are subject to a number of obligations
resulting from laws, regulations and technical specifications, which relate to things like pollutant
or noise emissions, protection of soil and water, and dismantling/decommissioning. such
requirements influence the way we design our products because our customers expect us to
deliverproductsfittofulfiltheirobligations.
374
13.3.1 technicalrequirements
our customers use the hvdc systems we produce to connect energy generating facilities to the
electricity grid. in addition they connect the gas/steam/wind turbines we produce to the
electricity grid. typically grid codes or similar regulations around the globe set technical
parameters that any facility connected to an electricity grid must fulfill in order to ensure safe
and reliable operation of the electricity grid. in particular, grid codes define parameters relating
to a facility’s active and reactive power supply and its characteristics during grid failures. these
requirementsmustusuallybefulfilledatthegridconnectionpoint.ineurope,gridoperatorsand
the eu commission defined such rules for generators (regulation (eu) 2016/631) as well as for
hvdc systems and dc-connected power park modules (regulation (eu) 2016/1447). similarly in
mexico high-voltage products including powergenerationequipmenthavetofulfil specifications
issued by public companies (cfe and pemex) but we expect that these will be regulated by the
governmentinthefuture.
13.3.2 airemissionlegislation
although legal requirements vary from country to country, all of the power plants that we build
for our customers using fossil fuel, gas and steam turbines have to comply with certain quality
requirements or technical specifications to be eligible for operation under applicable local laws.
this particularly concerns emission limits for all relevant airborne pollutants resulting from the
combustion process. in addition, certain installations like power plants are subjects to
environmental impact assessments in order to identify their impact for the surroundings. this
mayresultinemissionprotectionrequirementswhichmayincludefittingofcatalystsforco,nox
andnh emissionsorothermeasures.
3
in the european union, directive (eu) 2010/75 on industrial emissions (“ied”) aims at reducing
pollution from industrial activities, including energy generation. the ied contains emission limits
for certain combustion plants. in addition, the ied requires operators of power plants to be in
possessionofavalidpermitfortheiroperationandpreventandreducepollutionbyapplyingthe
best available techniques (“bats”). the eu commission develops reference documents on best
available techniques (“brefs”) and adopts key elements of the brefs as “bat conclusions”. the
bat conclusions contain emission limits associated with the best available techniques. for large
combustion plants, the eu commission adopted bat conclusions in 2017 which were published
on august 17, 2017. these bat conclusions stipulate emission requirements for among other
things dust, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury which are mostly stricter than current
emission limits. this may require operators to adjust their facilities which in turn require us to
updateourproductportfoliosothatwecansupplyserviceproducts.
germany has transposed the ied directive in the bimschg and implementing ordinances as well
as administrative guidelines. the implementing ordinances provide emission thresholds,
authorization requirements and supervisory obligations for new and existing facilities. since this
obligation is dynamic in nature even already licensed installations may require retrofitting
measures or other measures in order to comply with new standards. a draft bill to transpose the
latest bat conclusions relating to large combustion plants in the legal framework (13. bimschv)
waspublishedonjune25,2020.inaddition,in2019,germanyadoptedregistrationrequirements
and emission standards (e.g., relating to dust and sulphur dioxide) for medium sized combustion
plants(44.bimschv).
in the usa, most of the air emission requirements at the federal level are implemented through
programs under the caa. the caa programs that are most relevant to our business and
operations arethenationalemission standardsfor hazardousair pollutants (“neshap”) andthe
national air quality standards (“naaqs”). the neshap regulates the emissions by stationary
sources, including power plants, of 187 hazardous air pollutants (“hap”). under the caa, epa
hasset naaqsforthefollowing six“criteria”pollutantsconsideredharmfultopublichealthand
the environment: carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ground-level ozone,
particulate matter and lead. the caa identifies two types of national ambient air quality
standards for each of these criteria pollutants. primary standards provide public health
375
protection,includingprotectingthehealthof“sensitive”populationssuchasasthmatics,children
and the elderly. secondary standards provide public welfare protection, including protection
against decreased visibility and damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and buildings. a
geographicareathatmeetsordoesbetterthanthenaaqsiscalledanattainmentarea,whilean
area that does not meet this standard is called a nonattainment area. once these designations
take effect, state governments must develop state implementation plans outlining how the state
will attain andmaintain thestandardsbyreducingairpollutantemissions. anonattainmentarea
designation results in the application of more stringent requirements applicable to current and
newindustrialoperations,suchasrequirementstoinstallpollutioncontrolequipment.
in china, the law on prevention and control of atmospheric pollution (“air quality act”) is the
primary law dealing with air pollution, providing comprehensive measures of air pollution
prevention and control. the air quality act sets a specific goal of improving air quality and
emphasizes the control of air pollution caused, among others, by industrial production. the
chinese authorities have issued the integrated emission standards of air pollutants in order to
implement the general provisions of the air quality act. these standards specify emission limits
of 33 air pollutants and define specific emission standards for, among others, boilers and
thermal-power stations. in addition, the regulation on pollution discharge permitting requires
certaincompaniestoobtainandcomplywithapollutiondischargepermitforairemissions.local
authorities are encouraged to establish more stringent emission standards. furthermore,
industrial facilities must obtain a pollutant discharge permit for the emission of specified
hazardousandtoxicatmosphericpollutants.
in brazil, our customers must comply with the standards adopted by conama as well as the
emission limits adopted by the federal states. in particular, resolution 8/90 of december 6, 1990,
establishes maximum levels for air pollutants originating from external combustion processes on
stationary sites. resolution 382/06 of december 26, 2006 sets maximum levels of air pollution
emissionsfrompointsources.
in mexico, lgeepa also includes regulations on air-borne pollutants. at the federal level, these
regulations are complemented by official mexican standards (norma oficial mexicana, “nom”).
regarding the fossil fuel power plants as well as the gas and steam turbines that we build, our
customers must, in particular, comply with the nom-085-semarnat-2011for combustion plants.
this standard will, however, be replaced by the new nom-168-semarnat-asea-2016 that will,
amongothers,establishmaximumemissionlevelsforgasturbines.
13.3.3 noiseemissionlegislation
wind turbines, dc transformers, power plants based on fossil fuels and further products we
produce are subject to noise emission limits during their operation. in addition, authorities may
imposecertainnoisereductionobligationswhichtakelocalsurroundingsintoconsideration.
noise emission levels relating to the operation of sites in which our customers use our products
(fornoiserequirementsrelatingtoproductdesign,see“13.2.1design/constructionrequirements
(product safety, emissions, eco-design)” above), are mainly determined at local level. in
germany, the technical guidelines noise (“ta lärm”) set maximum noise emission limits for
installations depending on the area and time in which they are operated. in the future
authoritiesmaystipulatestricter noiseemissionlimits evenforfacilities alreadyinoperation.this
may require retrofitting measures, i.e., delivering components or carrying out construction or
otherworks.inchina,noiseemissions aregovernedbythelawonthepreventionandcontrolof
environmental noise pollution (“environmental noise act”) and implementing noise emission
standards. under the environmental noise act, facilities causing noise emissions must take
measures for eliminating and controlling such emissions. in brazil, conama resolution 1/90 of
march8,1990comprehensivelyregulatesnoiseemissioninindustrialandprivatecontext.
13.3.4 furtherenvironmentallaw(waterlaw,dismantlingobligations)
in the course of their operations our customers are subject to additional requirements under
environmental law, pertaining to things like the use and the protection of water as well
376
decommissioning/dismantling of their installations after cessation of use. our customers expect
ustosupplycomponentsandinstallationswithwhichtheycanfulfiltheirobligations.
our customers use water, which theyextract from andfeed-in torivers, canals andothersources,
to cool the power plants we produce. permit requirements, emission limits and further
obligations apply to such activities. on eu level, the ied and bat conclusions (e.g., relating to
large combustion plants) stipulate certain maximum levels for pollutants in water. in germany,
the abstraction of water and the feed-in of used water into water bodies are subject to a permit
under the whg. according to the whg, the feed-in of water is only permissible if the amount
and harmfulness of the water is as low as possible according to current state of the art.
regulations adopted under the whg define state of the art for wastewater of a number of
industry areas. in brazil, the national policy on water resources as well as certain resolutions by
theconamarequireourcustomers torespect certain standardsandbein possessionofapermit
for the discharge of effluents and for water collection from rivers or wells. in china, the law on
the prevention and control of water pollution and the regulation on pollution discharge
permitting requires our customers to obtain a wastewater discharge permit for the discharge of
industrial water. in addition, these rules establish national standards for the discharge of water
pollutants. local authorities are invited to adopt more stringent standards than the national
standards.
in addition, almost all turbines we produce contain oil or other substances which are hazardous
to water. although there are differences in national legislation, our customers are generally
obliged to adopt precautionary measures to avoid contamination of water and to remedy
contaminations if they do occur nevertheless. if our customers are obliged to carry out
remediation work, they may seek compensation from us if a defect in the products we deliver
causedthecontamination.similarprinciplesapplyifourcustomerscausesoilpollution.
our customers are also subject to decommissioning and dismantling obligations, for instance
relating to their wind turbines and fossil or nuclear power plants. these obligations vary
according to the product concerned and the country in which it is located. in germany, the
atomic energy act (atomgesetz) requires operators of nuclear power plants to decommission
their plants after they cease their operations. also operators of other power plants, such as wind
turbines, can be obligated to carry out decommissioning through ancillary conditions in permits,
like under the bimschg. such conditions are regularly included, in particular, if the plant was
constructed in certain protected areas. operators must decommission offshore wind turbines
when they ceased their operations for more than three years or if their planning permission
expires. regarding decommissioning of nuclear power plants, obligations similar to german law
also applyin swedenandfrance(démantèlement).intheu.s.,operatorsofnuclearpowerplants
have to provide sufficient funding for decommissioning and offer different ways on how to
decommission a nuclear power plant within 60 years. apart from this, decommissioning

13.4 market-related energy and climate policies and regulations
our production process and our products are particularly influenced by trends and developments
in energy and climate policies and regulations, particularly because such policies can create or
narrow markets or shape customer demands for particular technologies, products and services
provided by us across the entire energy value chain. although this applies to each and every
country around the globe, the eu, north american and chinese markets are the most important
marketsnotonlyintermsofvolumebutalsoasexamplesfordifferentpolicies.
13.4.1 europeanunionanduk
in european markets, we observe three closely interlinked regulation trends. driven by political
policies,regulationtoachieveclimateneutralityhasrecentlyincreased,withaparticularfocuson
377
a decline of fossil-based electricity generation such as in our coal or gas-fired power plants. in
turn, renewable energy sources (“res”) expand, combined with technical progress and
technology-specific as well as technology-neutral competition in the res sector. this particularly
affects sgre’s onshore and offshore wind power generation activities. finally, the overall res
trend requires the grid infrastructure to adapt to the increased feed-in from res on both the
transmission and distribution level as well as to long-distance transmission between generation
andloadcenters.
13.4.1.1 climateneutralityanddecarbonization
our fossil-fired energy generation as well as oil and gas infrastructure business are particularly
affectedbypoliciesandregulationsaimingatclimateneutrality,i.e.,bywayofdecarbonization.
europeangreendeal
basedonacommunicationfromtheeucommission(com(2019)640final),the“europeangreen
deal”, the eu shall achieve climate neutrality by 2050 in line with the paris agreement. the
european green deal sets out a net-zero ghg emission economy by 2050, defines targets for
phasing out coal and decarbonizing gas, envisages a clean and circular economy and increased
energy performance of buildings, and includes a shift to sustainable and smart mobility. at the
end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020, the european council and all eu member states, except
poland, as well as the european parliament endorsed this concept. in january 2020, the eu
commission presented an investment plan for a sustainable europe (com(2020) 21 final) to
mobilize at least € 1 trillion of sustainable investments over the next decade. on march 4, 2020,
the eu commission proposed a regulation establishing the framework for achieving climate
neutrality(com/2020/80final)toimplementthisconcept,the“europeanclimatelaw”.thisshall
empower the eu commission to adopt a 2030-2050 eu-wide trajectory for ghg emission
reductions by delegated acts and to assess the consistency of eu and national measures with the
eu’s climate neutrality objective every five years. this eu strategy will likely lead to a phase-out
of fossil-based energy generation, especially coal-fired power plants. furthermore, on may 27,
2020, the eu commission presented a proposal for a new european major recovery package,
which also commits to rolling out renewable energy projects, especially wind, solar and clean
hydrogen. another component of the european green deal is the hydrogen strategy for a
climate-neutral europe, which the eu commission presented on july 8, 2020 (com(2020) 301
final). this eu strategy shall contribute to the decarbonization of industrial processes and
economic sectors where reducing carbon emissions is difficult to achieve by utilizing carbon
capturetechnologiesasaninterimsolutionfortheproductionofhydrogen(bluehydrogen)until
sufficient renewable energy sources are available to produce clean hydrogen (green hydrogen).
similar strategies are in parallel being established at member state level, like the german
nationalhydrogenstrategyofjune2020.
2030climateandenergyframework
for the period from 2021 to 2030, the 2030 climate and energy framework (“2030
framework”) applies. this policy is based on a communication from the eu commission
(com(2014) 15 final) that was adopted by the european council in october 2014 (euco
169/14). it aims at a reduction of ghg emissions in the eu by at least 40% compared to 1990,
an increase of energy efficiency by at least 32.5% as well as an increase of res in final energy
consumption to at least 32% (“eu 2030 targets”). the initial 27% res and energy efficiency
targets were revised upwards in the course of the recast of the renewable energy directive
(eu) 2018/2001 (“red ii”). to meet these targets, the eu, inter alia, revised the eu ets and
adopted regulation (eu) 2018/842 on binding annual ghg emission reductions by member
states for 2021 to 2030 (“european climate protection regulation”). the latter requires
minimum contributions of the member states during that period, although the specific ghg
emission reduction targets vary between 0% and 40% compared to 2005 levels. member states
exceeding their emission targets may purchase emission allowances from other member states
to offset their deficit. germany, for example, shall achieve a ghg reduction of 38% by 2030
378
compared to 2005. as part of the european green deal, the eu commission aims to propose
raisingtheeu2030targets toat least 50%andeven55%inaresponsibleway.
cleanenergypackage
in 2019, the eu completed a comprehensive update of its energy policy framework on climate
neutrality and decarbonization objectives. the so-called “clean energy for all europeans
package” is based on proposals of the eu commission published in november 2016 and consists
of a total of eight legislative acts, including, in particular, the red ii and the second regulation
(eu)2019/943ontheinternalmarketforelectricity(“emrii”).
rediiraisestheoveralleubindingtargetforresfinalconsumptionby2030toatleast32%.the

eachmemberstateshallsetanobligationonfuelsupplierstoensurethattheshareofrenewable
energy within the final consumption of energy in the transport sector is at least 14% by 2030.
member states must also adopt national policies that aim to develop the market for alternative
transport fuels and infrastructure, including recharging stations. the requirements of red ii have
tobetransposedintonationallawuntiljune30,2021,
the emr ii focusses on requirements for capacity markets where power plant operators are not
only paid for the production of electricity but also for the potential production of electricity
(reserve power). it sets out conditions and limits particularly regarding the future use of fossil
technology. capacity mechanisms should be temporary and designed to address and identify
problems of resource adequacy. under emr ii, energy generation facilities emitting more than
550goffossilco perkwhandanaverageof350kgofco peryearperkwinstalledwillnotbe

able to participate in capacity mechanisms after june 2025. thus, power plants that have
participated in the capacity reserve may no longer participate in capacity market mechanisms.
emr ii further requires member states to review and, if necessary, adjust their bidding zones to
ensure market liquidity, efficient congestion management and overall market efficiency. any
adjustments to the bidding zones might also affect existing capacity mechanisms by reducing
demandforcapacity.
eutaxonomy
financing mechanisms set out further incentives for the phase-out of fossil-fuel power
generation. based on a proposal from the eu commission (com(2018) 353 final), in december
2019 the european council and the european parliament reached a political agreement on a
proposed regulation on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment
(council doc. 14970/19), the so–called “eu taxonomy”, which in turn was adopted by the
european council (council doc. 5639/20) on april 15, 2020 and by the european parliament on
june 18, 2020. from december 2021 onwards, the eu taxonomy shall implement a classification
system at eu level to define environmentally sustainable economic activities. one objective is to

climateprotectionlaws
there are additional laws and regulations at eu member state level which also aim at climate
neutrality and decarbonization. for example, the german climate protection law (bundes-
klimaschutzgesetz), adopted in november 2019, stipulates legally binding ghg emission targets
for various sectors. in the energy sector, ghg emissions must decrease from 280 million tons co
2
in 2020 to 175 million tons co in 2030; in the industrial production sector from 186 million tons
2
in 2020 to 140 million tons co in 2030. however, the precise implementation of these targets is
2
stillsubjecttofurtherlegislation.
in november2019,thefrenchparliament adoptedtheenergyandclimate law (loi n°2019-1147
du 8 novembre 2019 relative à l’énergie et au climat). in addition to its national reduction target
in non-eu ets sectors set by eu law, this law requires a further reduction of fossil fuel
consumption by 40% by 2030 compared to 2012 and achievement of the long-term target of
carbonneutralityby2050.
furthermore, the british climate change act of 2008, as amended in june 2019, sets a net-zero
ghgemission reduction target by 2050 compared to 1990levels aswell aslegally bindingcarbon
budgets. this act requires the uk government to set legally binding carbon budgets, as of the
date of this prospectus providing for a ghg emission reduction of 51% in 2025 and of 57% in
2030.
phase-outofcoal-firedpowergeneration
further laws at eu member state level provide for a definite phase-out of coal-fired power
generation, however, with varying time schedules. in germany, the coal exit law
(kohleverstromungsbeendigungsgesetz, “kvbg”) of august 8, 2020, sets a shutdown schedule
for lignite power, including a total of € 4.35 billion of compensation. for hard coal the bill

off the grid until 2026. the first auction will still take place in 2020 and take 4 gw of hard coal-
fired power generation off the grid at a maximum remuneration of € 165,000 per mw.
subsequentauctionswill followuntil2026atdegressiveremunerationrates.from2027onwards,
the hard coal phase-out shall be subject to forced shutdowns. by 2022, the share of coal-fired
power generation from hard coal and lignite-fired power plants shall be reduced to around 15
gw each. by 2030, further reductions to around eight gw are planned for hard coal-fired power
plants and nine gw for lignite-fired power plants. the overall phase-out of coal-fired power
generation shall be completed by 2038 at the latest. other member states have scheduled an
even faster phase-out. for example, the french coal-fired power generation phase-out plan
(stratégie nationale bas-carbone) as adopted by french parliament in 2015 will lead to a
shutdownoftheremainingfourcoal-firedpowerplantsinfranceby2022.
under an implementation plan on the end of unabated coal by 2025 of january 2018, the uk
government plans to set an emission limit of 450g of carbon per kwh on coal-fired power
generatorsfromoctober1,2025resultinginadefactophase-out.
emissionthresholdsandtrading
in addition to laws and regulations that directly lead to a phase-out of fossil-based power
generation, further policies incentivize the decrease and shut-down of carbon generation. for
example, the ied aims to reduce harmful industrial emissions by requiring industrial installations
to meet emission values for certain pollutants based on bat as published by the eu commission
in the brefs. we expect these standards will become more stringent and comprehensive over
timeandthereforewemustadaptourproductsaswellasourproductionsitesaccordingly.
another important instrument is the eu ets, which implemented a market to trade a capped
number of euas for companies operating within the european economic area (“eea”).
380
operators of energy-intensive installations (power generation facilities and industrial plants)
must buy and sell those allowances in order to cover their emissions. the european union
annually reduces the available allowances, in order to increase their prices and create incentives
to reduce co emission. the overall number of euas shall further decline at an annual rate of
2
2.2% (linear reduction factor) from 2021 onwards, compared to 1.74% currently. the economic
viability and competitiveness of our power generation products depend, inter alia, on the price
of the euas, which is volatile and therefore not predictable due to its dependence on the
cap-and-trade scheme. to counteract the volatility of the eu ets and to improve its stability, the
european union established a market stability reserve in 2019 (decision (eu) 2015/1814),
providing an automatic adjustment of the supply of auctioned allowances by reducing the
surplus orcounteractingashortage.itthereforeimprovestheeuets’resilience tomarketshocks
andenhancesmarketstability.
carbontax
in addition to the eu ets, some member states imposed further national regulations to promote
the reduction of ghg emissions by increasing their costs through taxes and charges in order to
reachthetargetsdefinedbytheeuropeanclimateprotectionregulation.
for example, the german fuel trading act (brennstoffemissionshandelsgesetz, “behg”) of 2019
implemented a national emission trading system. from 2021 onwards, companies placing fossil
fuels on the market are obliged to acquire emission allowances for the ghg emissions caused by
their products. the behg is supposed to increase the prices for petrol and heating oil, but will
alsoincreasethemarketpricesforallproductsthatdependontheuseoffossilfuels.exemptions,
however, apply for industrial sectors covered by the eu ets in order to avoid double taxation.
under a bill amending the behg, the price per ton co shall increase to initially € 25 and then
2
gradually rise to € 55 in 2025. for the year 2026, a price corridor of at least € 55 and at most
€65shallapply.
in france, the climate energy contribution (contribution climat énergie, “cce”), introduced by
the french finance law (loi n° 2013-1278 de finances) in 2014, sets an annually increasing
indirect co price component by adding a surcharge to existing taxes on fossil fuels, initially at

in france was around € 45 and by january 2019 it should have risen to € 55. however, due to

chptechnologyandnuclearpowerplants
regarding chp plants, the market development is highly dependent on different national
support schemes. the german heat and power cogeneration act
(kraft-wärme-kopplungsgesetz, “kwkg 2019”) provides for financial incentives for operators of
new, modernized or retrofitted chp, except coal and lignite-fired chp. it also supports the
construction and expansion of energy-efficient district heating/cooling networks as well as the
construction and retrofitting of heating/cooling storage facilities. an amendment to the kwkg
2019 passed alongside the kvbg shall create incentives to replace coal-fired chp with modern
chpsystems.
our products such as steam turbines and power plant control technologies can partially be used
in nuclear power plants and we observe that eu member states handle the phase out from
nuclear energy differently since the eu green deal does not exclude the use of nuclear power to
381
achieve the set targets. in 2011, germany revised its atomic energy act (atomgesetz) to
ultimatelyphaseoutallnuclearpowergenerationby2022.inaugust2015,franceadoptedalaw
to reduce its share of nuclear energy from 75% to 50% by 2025 (loi n° 2015-992 relative à la
transition énergétique pour la croissance verte) but later amended the schedule to achieve this
targetby2035.
capacitymechanisms
although we observe that conventional energy production is declining due to changes in the
regulatory framework described above, we believe that fossil technologies are still required in
the transitional phase to compensate the high volatility of res power supply and ensure grid
stability. to this end, several eu member states have established capacity market mechanisms
(e.g., france, poland, italy, (uk) and germany) that the eu commission approved under eu state
aidlaw(see,e.g.,2017/c068/01).
in germany, the energy industry act (energiewirtschaftsgesetz, “enwg”) provides for an energy-
only electricity market with three capacity reserve mechanisms (kapazitätsreserve, netzreserve
and sicherheitsbereitschaft). thesemechanisms compensateregionally different loaddistribution
in the grid to avoid congestion (network reserve (netzreserve)), prevent a shortage of electricity
by providing an electricity production reserve (capacity reserve (kapazitätsreserve)) and allow for
security readiness of lignite-fired power plants (sicherheitsbereitschaft) up to 2023 followed by a
permanent decommissioning. in addition, network stability can also be ensured by prohibiting
the decommissioning of system relevant power plants. furthermore, tsos may keep specific
network facilities (netztechnische betriebsmittel), in particular even conventional energy
generation facilities, available in order to restore security of energy supply in the event of local
equipmentfailure.
france implemented a national market-wide capacity mechanism for providers offering capacity
when there is a risk of a network bottleneck (loi n°2010-1488 sur la nouvelle organisation du
marché de l’electricité dite). in return, the providers receive certificates that suppliers need to
purchase in order to cover the peak demand of their customers. in poland, where coal-fired
power plants can participate in capacity auctions, successful bidders receive a steady payment
during the duration of the capacity agreement. italy, on the other hand, already restricted the
participation of power plants that do not comply with the co emission limits set under the
2
changedrequirementsforcapacitymechanismsunderemrii.
under the uk energy act 2013 and implementing regulations, capacity reserves in the uk are
established by tsos who organize centrally-managed technology-neutral auctions to procure the
level of capacity required to ensure electricity supply at times of stress events on the electricity
system. in previous auctions, bids of operators of gas and coal-fired power plants were also
accepted.
13.4.1.2 renewableenergyexpansionandfinancialfunding
as major consequences of the promotion of climate neutrality and decarbonization, we observe
frequent changes and considerable effort in renewable energy expansion regulations and
policies that affect our business. eu member states have to provide national energy and climate
plans (“necp”) to the eu commission which provide an overview of their contribution to
reachingoveralleuclimateandresplans.however,thecountriesstilldecidethemselvesontheir
national energy mixes. we are therefore required to simultaneously project the demand for our
products on independently developing rather thanonnational markets. thenationally preferred
res technologies may vary, not only for geographical reasons such as res resources but also for
diversificationpurposes.
generalresexpansiontargets
european states have enacted partially ambitious national res expansion targets in the past. the
germanrenewableenergyact2017(erneuerbareenergiengesetz2017, “eeg2017”) aimsforat
least 40% renewable electricity generation by 2025, 55% by 2035 and at least 80% by 2050.
382
the 2035 aim was increased to 65% by an amendment of the eeg 2017 passed alongside the
kvbg.thecurrent spanishdraftbillonclimatechangeandenergytransition(laleydecambio
climático y transición energética) aims at a share of 74% res in electricity generation by 2030.
the danish necp of december 2019 aims at 55% res in energy consumption and 100%
renewable electricity by 2030. finland’s necp of december 20, 2019, sets a target of 51% of final
energy consumption by 2030 and sweden’s necp of january 16, 2020, aims at 50% of final
energy consumption already for 2020. transitioning the electricity generation sector remains at

business but may also promote our offshore portfolio ranging from across theentire valuechain,
including hvdc offshore grid connections, sgre’s offshore wind turbines and offshore wind
powerplantsubstationsaswellastherespectiveservice.
following brexit, the uk did not file a final necp with the eu commission. under the latest uk
draft necp of january 2019, the scottish climate change plan of february 2018 and scottish
energy strategy of december 2017 set a target of 50% of all of scotland’s heat, transport and
electricity consumption to be supplied from res by 2030. the welsh government set targets for
generating70%ofitselectricityconsumptionfromrenewableenergyby2030.
windexpansiontargets
in germany, pursuant to theeeg2017,installation ofnewonshorewind capacity is toexpandby
2,900 mw annually as of 2020, whereas solar capacity shall expand annually by 2,500 mw. in
part, joint auctions with solar pv are held to assign and determine the financial funding. the
tender volumes increase by the volumes that were not assigned in the previous year. for 2020
seven wind onshore auctions with atotal volumeof4.100mw areplanned.undertheeeg2017,
offshore wind expansion target is set to 6,500 mw by 2020. a total of 15,000 mw shall be
installed until 2030. on may 12, 2020, however, the federal government, coastal federal states
and tsos responsible for offshore wind power plant connections reached a political agreement
to increase the 2030 target to 20,000 mw. this aim shall be implemented in the course of the
revision of the offshore wind act (windenergie-auf-see-gesetz), which is still ongoing as of the
dateofthisprospectus.
the recently updated french energy and climate act sets a target of 3.5 gw of offshore wind
capacity in 2024 and starting from 2024, implements auction procedures of 1 gw per year
offshore capacity and 1.8 gw onshore capacity (repowering not included). auctions for onshore
wind start in the second half of 2020 until 2024 with 2 auctions per year of 925 mw per auction.
in april 2020, the latest draft of france’s multi-year energy plan (programmations pluriannuelles
de l’énergie was approved with an onshore wind target of 24.1 gw by 2023 and between 33.2
and 34.7 gw by 2028 as well as an offshore wind target of 2.4 gw by 2023 and between 5.2 and
6.2by2028.
spain, pursuant to its necp of january 20, 2020, targets 120 gw of total res capacity by 2030,
aiming for a 90% increase in installed wind capacity (onshore and offshore) to 50 gw by 2030.
under denmark’s latest necp of december 2019, no individual targets for specific technologies
have yet been set but the plan estimates wind (onshore and offshore) generation to reach a
combined share of nearly 20% in the overall energy consumption. sweden’s necp expects wind
power to increase by 5 gw between 2017 and 2030 and finland’s necp projects 5.5 gw of
installedwindpowercapacityby2030.
regarding the uk,theoffshore windsector dealofmarch 2019seesoffshore wind contributing
up to 30 gw of generating capacity by 2030, subject to further cost decreases. in her speech on
the uk government’s program of december 19, 2019, the queen outlined that the uk
governmentintendstoincreasethetargetforinstalledoffshorewindenergyto40gwby2030.
challengesforwindexpansion
despite the expansion targets, the actual increase of onshore and offshore wind remains
challenging. main hurdles mostly for onshore wind expansion in every jurisdiction include
383
turbines’ effects on people (noise in particular), wildlife (flight of birds) and natural scenery
(aesthetic pollution), permit requirements and procedures, energetic and, thus, economically
viable location selection, transmission of produced electricity as well as legal action against wind
energy projects. acceptance is a challenge particularly for onshore wind in germany and projects
are often delayed because of environmental court claims. in addition, an amendment of the
german building code (baugesetzbuch) of august 8, 2020, enables the german federal states to
applyadistanceruleinresidentialareasofupto1,000meterswithoutprejudicetoexistingrules.
other jurisdictions have already enacted even lower distance rules, such as in france where 500
metersapplyundertheenergylawcode(codedel’énergie).
on october 7, 2019, the federal ministry for the economy and energy (bundesministerium für
wirtschaft und energie) published a list of action points to be implemented in 2020 aiming to
accelerate approval procedures for onshore wind power plants, inter alia, by centralizing
approval authorities, amending species protection legislation and limiting the effects of legal
procedures against approval decisions. on august 12, 2020, the federal government adopted a
bill on an investment acceleration act, which shall inter alia shorten administrative proceedings
for large onshore wind turbines and exclude suspensory effects of law suits againstsuchprojects.
comparableapprovaleffects couldbeobservedin franceafter thehighestfrenchadministrative
court, the conseil d’etat, in december 2017 had annulled a decree designating the prefect of a
region as the authority for issuing the required environmental permits, causing legal uncertainty
forprojectsthatwereapprovedunderthisdecree.
anotherchallengeforonshoreandoffshorewindexpansionconcernsthecongestionofthegrid.
in thepast, germanyhadcreatedmassiveinvestmentincentivesforoffshorewindgeneration.as
of 2009, the tsos had to connect offshore wind power plants to the transmission grid free of
charge under the enwg, unlike onshore grid-connections and unlike in many other jurisdictions,
such as the uk. since 2012, the enwg also enables offshore wind power plant operators to claim
compensationintheamountof90%oftheirhypotheticalremunerationfromthetsosincaseof
delays, malfunctions or maintenance works. the tso may be able to revert to its general
contractor under the respective contract. in any case, these incentives have resulted in a
congestion of the grid. the commissioning of further connection and feed-in capacity would,
thus, either increase feed-in management by the respective tsos or require the expansion of
transmission capacities. under the current german framework of the enwg and the eeg 2017,
bids for financial funding of onshore wind projects may be rejected, even during tender
proceedings, if they relate to grid-expansion areas. grid congestion regulation may, thus, impact
our on and offshore wind business, including our hvdc business, where sales opportunities are
closelylinkedtotheoffshorewindexpansiontargets.
to solve grid congestion, in particular low-loss hvdc links are to be established to transport
electricity to southern consumption centers of germany, thereby reducing regional grid load in
the northern areas of generation. the german grid expansion acceleration act
(netzausbaubeschleunigungsgesetz, “nabeg”) contains a special procedure to accelerate
approval proceedings for infrastructure projects. it applies to urgently required extra-high-
voltage lines crossing inner-german or international borders and connections between offshore
windpowerplantsubstationsandtheonshoregrid.
respromotionschemes
inadditiontostate-setexpansiontargets,thedemandforourproductsisalsodrivenbydifferent
financial promotion schemes leveraging our clients’ investments. these promotion schemes have
been subject to amendments and policy changes in the past that not only affect the profitability
of our clients’ investments, but also the demand for our onshore and offshore wind products. as
a general trend we have observed a decline in the amount of financial promotion in many
jurisdictions in recent years, sometimes gradual and sometimes more drastically. in addition, we
noticed a shift from fixed feed-in tariffs to market-based tendering procedures. under many
prior frameworks, fixed feed-in tariffs were designed to guarantee investors an initial and fixed
phase of constant return, whereas market-based tender proceedings aim at competition and
cost-effectivenessinresexpansion.
384
for example in germany, different statutory res support mechanisms have been in place since
1991. since april 1, 2000, the applicable regulations are set out in the eeg, which underwent
several major amendments in 2004, 2009, 2012, 2014 and 2017. generally, financial funding has
been reduced over time, depending on the point in time the installation first commenced
operation. in part, financial funding is also subject to options, which provide additional
incentives, such as increased initial tariffs for offshore wind power plants (stauchungsmodell)
that commenced operation prior to january 1, 2020. despite repeated changes to the funding
schemes, the financial fundingfor aparticular project hasgenerally beenfixed for aperiodof20
years following its start of operations. however, new investments are generally only eligible for
financialfundingifawardedinamarket-basedtenderprocedure,asultimatelyestablishedunder
the eeg 2017 and the offshore wind act (windenergie-auf-see-gesetz). comparably, the
netherlands, france in 2017 and spain in 2016 implemented auction-based remuneration
schemes. also poland changed its system in 2016. the uk initiated its transition to auction-based
support schemes in 2014. however, differences exist with regard to the auction design, i.e.,
concerning the existence and amount of auctions, the volumes auctioned (installed capacity or
energy), the technologies auctioned (e.g., jointly or separately), whether schemes relate to the
purchase of power or are paid as additional premium to market sales and, especially, regarding
thedurationandre-assessmentofschemes.

proceedings, in order to determine the amount of financial funding. in accordance with theemr
ii, financial funding shall only be paid in addition to earnings resulting from direct marketing of
theenergyproducedontheelectricitymarkets.
in addition, promotion schemes are regularly subject to eu state aid law in connection with the
eu commission’s “guidelines on state aid for environmental protection and energy 2014-2020”,
whichwillbeprolongeduntil2022accordingtoadraftcommunicationoftheeucommission.
13.4.1.3 gridexpansionandinvestmentregulation
the expansion of renewable electricity sources coincides with a need for grid expansion in the
transmission and distribution systems. we observe a general transition of the electricity supply
systems which were originally designed for the feed-in of centralized power generation. as the
share of volatile renewable electricity generation grows, grid requirements change and more
decentralizedaswellasinterconnectionandflexiblesolutionsarerequired.
expansionobligationsoftsos
pursuant to the emr ii and national legislation, all european tsos are generally obliged to
maintain, expand and optimize the grid to meet the demand to the extent economically
reasonable. therefore, tsos are obliged to develop and execute national and eu-wide network
developmentplans.
in addition, several national laws apply in member states that accelerate grid expansion to
reduce grid congestion. in the past such bottlenecks were, in particular, caused by the delay of
infrastructure expansion projects. to this end, legislation like the german enwg and the energy
line extension act (energieleitungsausbaugesetz, “enlag”) expedite approval requirements and
procedures for projects that serve the public interest. also the nabeg aims at accelerating
important extra-high-voltage line grid extensions, but is subject to a rather complex proceeding.
in any case, the applicable approval requirements such as the thresholds for electromagnetic
fields under the electromagnetic fields ordinance (verordnung über elektromagnetische felder,
26. bimschv) have to be complied with and affected individuals and environmental associations
maybeentitledtofilelawsuitsagainsttheapprovalsobtainedbyatso.
refinancingofgrid-relatedinvestments
grid tariffs are the main source of income for tsos and, inter alia, refinance grid-related
investments. therefore, the regulation of tsos’ profits also impacts the sales of our transmission
portfolio. there is, however, no full harmonization of grid tariff regulation at eu level. emr ii
385
requires that tariffs are cost-reflective, transparent, take into account the need for network
security and flexibility as well as reflect actual costs incurred insofar as they correspond to those
of an efficient and structurally comparable network operator, be applied in a non-discriminatory
manner and provide for incentives to increase efficiency. theimplementation oftheseguidelines
differs in part in eu member states. in the past, many member states took a cost-based
regulation approach in form of a guaranteed rate-of-return or cost-plus regulation adding a
profit margin to the costs of a grid operator. these models have more and more been replaced
by incentive-based regulations which provide financial rewards or penalties with a view to an
efficient cost base. incentive-based regulation usually takes the form of yearly revenue caps or
pricecapsinconnectionwithaguaranteedrateofreturntoensuresufficientinvestmentintothe
grid. most member states, but not germany and spain, use a wacc factor (weighted average
cost of capital) to calculate the rate of return. in addition, efficiency requirements force grid
operatorstoreducecostsandworkmoreefficientlyregardingtheiropexand/orcapex.
in germany, the enwg, the ordinance on electricity grid tariffs (stromnetzentgeltverordnung,
“stromnev”) and the ordinance on incentive regulation (anreizregulierungsverordnung,
“aregv”) implement the requirements of eu law. the bnetza defines a revenue cap for each
calendar year of a regulatory period. for electricity tsos, the current (third) regulatory period
began on january 1, 2019 and will end on december 31, 2023. the respective revenue caps are
based on the tsos’ cost base level (kostenausgangsniveau) which is determined according to a
cost analysis two years prior to the beginning of the regulatory period. the calculated grid costs
also serve as input parameter for an efficiency benchmarking prior to the regulatory period in
which theindividual efficiency factors andtargets (xind) aredeterminedthroughtheapplication
of complex benchmarking methodologies. however, an efficiency benchmark is generally not
applied to permanently non-influenceable costs (dauerhaft nicht beeinflussbare kosten). under
the aregv, grid expansion measures fall within the scope of permanently non-influenceable
costs if they increase interconnector capacity and/or compromise pilot usage ofhvdctechnology
to expand grid capacity or to connect (even inner-german) grids. special rules also apply for the
replacement of infrastructure. whereas the aregvgenerally sets out a project-specific deduction
for the respective costs of a measure, leading to a decrease of recognized costs and thus to
reduced profit generated by replacements, such deduction does not apply to investments in
hvdc systems intended to expand system capacity or to establish new cross-border connections.
adjustments are performed as of january 1 of each year. accordingly, a tso is generally entitled
toadjustitsgridtariffsinaccordancewithitsadjustedrevenue.
a further key driver for the determination of the revenue caps are the bnetza’s determinations
of interest rates providing for the imputed return on equity within the cost base level. in the
current third regulatory period, the bnetza has decreased these interest rates from 7.14% in the
second regulatory period (2014-2018) to 5.12% (assets commissioned prior to january 1, 2006,
“old assets”) and from 9.05% to 6.91% (assets commissioned as of january 1, 2006, “new
assets”). the respective interest rates are applied to non-influenceable costs regardless of the
tso’s individual efficiency. another important component of the revenue cap determination is
the sectoral productivity factor (xgen), which reflects the deviation of the electricity grid specific
from the general economic productivity, and, as of the third regulatory period, is determined by
the bnetza at 0.9% for electricity grid operators, compared to 1.5% in the second regulatory
period pursuant to the aregv. however, the determination has been appealed and proceedings
arependingasofthedateofthisprospectus.
under the network charge modernization act (netzentgeltmodernisierungsgesetz) of july 22,
2017, tsos are no longer entitled to recover investments for offshore grid connections via
network tariffs but rather via a separate offshore surcharge. under the ordinance on the
calculation of the offshore surcharge and regarding adjustments in regulation law
(verordnung zur berechnung der offshore-netzumlage und zu anpassungen im
regulierungsrecht) of march 21, 2019, the provisions of the stromnev apply accordingly to the
offshoresurcharge.hence,equityinterestcalculationoffutureoffshoregridconnectionsremains
386
unchanged.likeunderthepriorframework,therespectivecostsareexcludedfromtheefficiency
benchmark. costs for establishing offshore grid connections may be settled annually via the
offshoresurcharge.
13.4.2 canada
like the eu, canada is a party to the paris agreement and committed to decreasing national
emissions by 30% in 2030 compared to the base year 2005. the pan-canadian framework on
clean growth and climate change (“pcf”) implements this policy for all sectors of the economy.
the pcf is supplemented by further policies and measures of canadian provinces and territories
andsupportedbyfederalinvestmentssuchas,forinstance,alowcarboneconomyfund.
13.4.2.1 expansionofnon-emittingelectricitysources
although the canadian energy mix varies among the provinces, canada’s emissions from
electricity generation are already generally considered to be low, with more than 80% of
electricity beinggeneratedbynon-emittingsources,mainlyhydroelectricity accordingtothepcf.
under the green energy act of 2009, ontario launched a feed-in tariff program which was
however terminated by ministerial order of july 13, 2018 due to increasing electricity prices. in
addition,thefederaldepartmentofnaturalresourcescanadagenerallyproposesfourpathways
forcanada’senergytransition,namelywastinglessenergy,switchingtocleanpower,usingmore
renewable fuels and producing cleaner oil and gas. according to this, all provinces must
recognize renewable energy expansion as a requirement and embark on various programs to
increaseitsproportion.
13.4.2.2 carbonpricingandcoalphase-outstandards
another key component to achieve decarbonization is the federal ghg pollution pricing act
(“ghgppa”) of 2018, which implements carbon pricing as of 2019, starting with cad 20 per
emitted ton of co . the carbon price shall rise to cad 50 per ton of co by 2022, with an annual
2 2
increase of cad 10 and applies to 21 types of fuel and combustible waste. already prior to the
ghgppa, the provinces had partially established regulatory frameworks to address and enforce
decarbonization. for example, british columbia has had a carbon-tax in place since 2008 whereas
quebec participates in a cap-and-trade program with u.s. state of california. against this

ghgppa is fraught with legal uncertainty because canadian provincial courts have ruled
differently on the competence to impose carbon pricing provisions in the provinces. ultimately,

on november 29, 2018, the canadian department of environment issued a new emission
performance standard regulation for conventional coal-fired power plants. operators are only
allowed to continue operation if they comply with substantially increased emission performance
standards for coal-fired electricity generating units by 2030, such as by utilizing carbon capture
technologies. otherwise they have to cease operation at the end of the fiftieth year following
their respective commissioning date but no later than december 31, 2029. electricity generating
units which commenced their operation prior to 1974 had to comply with the standards or
alreadyceaseoperationbydecember31,2019.
13.4.2.3 consequencesofrisingelectricitypricesforthefinancialpromotionofrenewables
in canada several provinces have addressed price increases in electricity in their policies and as a
consequence have even terminated ongoing projects. for instance, ontario enacted the green
energyrepealacttostopapprovalsfor“wastefulenergyprojects”wheretheneedforelectricity
was not clearly demonstrated. on june 10, 2019, the alberta government suspended alberta’s
2016 res program (“rep”) and required that at least 30% of energy must be produced by res.
387
the rep had been enabled for a total of three investment rounds and that existing projects be
continued until at least 2021, however now no additional tendering proceedings will be carried
out. the government of ontario declared a moratorium on offshore wind power plants in 2011
whichprecludesdevelopmentinthegreatlakes.
13.4.2.4 establishmentofthecanadianenergyregulatorandrevisedimpactassessment
the canadian federal and provincial governments share regulatory jurisdiction over the oil, gas
and electricity sectors, resulting in a number of legal and regulatory frameworks for the
exploration of canadian oil and gas reserves and in the electricity sector overall. as a
consequence neither a single energy policy nor a single regulatory body exists. however, on
june 21, 2019, the canadian parliament passed bill c-69, which included the canadian energy
regulator (“cer”) act (“cer act”) to replace the national energy board act, and established the
cer as a federal regulatory committee with federal authority on august 28, 2019. under the cer
act, cer is competent for oil and gas pipelines, including traffic and tariffs, international power
lines and certain interprovincial power lines, renewable energy projects and offshore power
lines, access to lands and the exportation of oil, gas and electricity as well as the interprovincial
oilandgastrade.
bill c-69 also includes the impact assessment act (“ia act”) under which the federal impact
assessment agency (“iaa”) is established. the federal impact assessment process established
under the ia act serves as a planning tool which takes into account a broad range of potential
environmental, health, social and economic effects of designated projects identified by
regulation or designated by the minister of environment and climate change. decisions are
based on whether the potential adverse effects in areas of federal jurisdiction are in the public
interest and in contrast to the previous environmental assessment process, where decisions were
based on whether a project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. the
impact assessment covers a comprehensive catalogue of factors to be decided on and also
providesforpublicparticipation.
13.4.2.5 infrastructureexpansion
the cer must approve construction of transmission lines across provincial boundaries and, as per
theiaact,infrastructureprojectswithinprovincesaswell.investmentsbythetsosareregulated
by both the provincial regulator of each province and by the cer as far as investments between
provinces or import and export of electricity to neighboring jurisdictions are concerned. canada
has a long-term infrastructure plan in place to cover green infrastructure. the canadian
infrastructure bank attracts and co-invests with private and institutional investors, such as tsos,
in new, revenue-generating infrastructure projects that are in the public interest prioritizing,
interalia,greeninfrastructureprojects.
13.4.3 usa
energy and climate policies in the u.s. differ significantly from those in effect in the european
union and canada and remain hard to predict over mid and long term. in the absence of
mandatory ghg emission reduction targets at the federal level, individual states have taken
different approaches to reduce sector-specific ghg emissions. for example, although the u.s.
federal administration in 2019 terminated the paris agreement with effect as of november 4,
2020, two thirds of the u.s. states have enacted certain renewable portfolio standards (“rps”) to
promotetheuseofcleanelectricitysourcesandtwelvestatesoperateetss.
13.4.3.1 theu.s.energydominancepolicy
the u.s. energy dominance policy (“edp”) under the trump administration repealed and
replaced several regulations promulgated under the prior obama administration to reduce ghg
emissions consistent with goals set by the usa under the paris agreement. unlike existing
europeanpolicies, the edp intends to drive economic growth by increasing oil andgasextraction
andacceleratinginfrastructuredevelopment.federallegislativeeffortsincludeadditionaldrilling

opportunities and prioritized proceedings for pipeline projects and lng terminals. most notably,
alaska’s arctic national wildlife refuge was opened up for oil and gas drilling activities at the
end of 2017. however, in september 2019, congress passed the arctic cultural and coastal plain
protection act restoring protection of the arctic refuge. as of the date of this prospectus, the bill
ispendingapprovalinthesenate.
following an executive presidential order, the epa on june 19, 2019, also repealed the carbon
pollution emission guidelines for existing sources, commonly referred to as the clean power plan
(“cpp”). the cpp was the first- u.s. national standard to address carbon pollution from power
plants, originally introduced by the epa under the caa in 2015. by setting strict co emission
2
limits, in particular for coal-fired power plants, the cpp aimed to cut co emissions from the
2
power sector by 32% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. the affordable clean energy rule (“ace
rule”) and related implementing regulations then replaced the cpp with the aim to reduce co
2
emissions without shutdowns of coal-fired power plants by promoting technology and
equipment upgrades. it establishes heat rate improvements, i.e., efficiency improvements, as the
best system of emission reduction for co , employing a broad range of technologies and
2
techniques. in determining their application, states may take into account the remaining useful
life of the source and other source-specific factors in establishing standards of performance,
which might allow for establishing less stringent standards of performance, in particular, for
plants with a near-term decommissioning date. however, the ace rule does not apply to
gas-firedpowerplants.
on january 25, 2018, the epa further issued a guidance memorandum on the reclassification of
sources for hap as area source under the caa at any time after taking steps to limit emissions
despite epa’s prior “once in always in policy”. subsequently, in 2019, epa issued a proposed rule
on the reclassification of major sources as area sources implementing its reclassification policy.
theapplicable eligibility threshold for areclassification is 10tonsperyearincaseofasinglehap
or25tonsofacombinationofdifferenthap.
on december 6, 2018, the epa issued an updated cross-state air pollution rule (close-out-rule),
which addresses interstate pollution obligations under the so-called “good neighbor” regime of
the caa and exempts 20 states from submitting state implementation plans and establishing
control requirements to address transported ozone pollution to ultimately allow other states to
meet their naaqs. on september 13, 2019, the d.c. circuit court of appeals, however, vacated
theclose-out-rule,holdingthatitviolatedcaarequirements.
under the obama administration, on june 3, 2016 the epa enacted various emission standards
for the oil and gas sector which are applicable to new, reconstructed and modified sources and
intend to curb emissions of methane, smog forming volatile organic compounds and toxic air
pollutants. the performance standards include a number of obligations to reduce methane
emissions from existing oil andgassources and,in particular, newsourceperformancestandards
(“nsps”). under the current policy, the epa has taken various approaches to postpone the
implementation of nsps standards. most recently on august 29, 2019, the epa issued a proposal
toremovemethanecontrolprovisionsfromthenspsforoilandnaturalgas.
industry-related approaches to lower emission standards are accompanied by less stringent
demand-side requirements regarding the consumption of oil and gas. for instance, the national
highwaytrafficsafetyadministration(“nhtsa”)andepajointlyissuedaruletofinalize“critical
parts” of the safer, affordable, fuel-efficient (safe) vehicles rule. under this rule, the nhtsa
claims statutory authority to set nationally applicable fuel economy standards. the rollout on
march 31, 2020 set standards that increase 1.5% in stringency each year from model years 2021
through 2026. compared to maintaining the post-2020 standards set forth in 2012, the u.s. fuel
consumption would thereby increase by about half a million barrels per day which, according to

389
13.4.3.2 co reductionandcleanenergystandards
2
despite the edp, there are also approaches to foster and enforce co emission reductions in the
2
usa. on the federal level, the house of representatives tried to compel the u.s. president to act
in accordance with the paris agreement with its climate action now act in may 2019. on
january 28, 2020, the committee on energy and commerce presented a draft for a climate
leadership and environmental action for our nation’s (clean) future act (“clean future act”)
aiming at a net-zero emission strategy by 2050 and providing for a clean electricity standard
(“ces”) requiring all retail electricity suppliers to provide an increasing supply of clean electricity
to consumers starting in 2022, increasing to 100% clean energy by 2050. on july 1, 2020,
democrats in the house select committee on the climate crisis released a climate crisis action
plan that aims to achieve “net-negative” emissions by 2100 and proposes comprehensive reforms
tofederalenvironmentalandenergylaws.
in addition, on february 27, 2020 senate representatives of both parties presented a draft
american energy innovation act (“aeia draft”) compiling more than 50 energy related bills. its
key provisions relate to energy efficiency, renewable energy and energy storage, carboncapture,
advanced nuclear technologies, industrial and vehicle technologies, grid security and
modernization, and workforce development. the us federal government has also incentivized
co emission reductions through federal tax credit programs, such as the section 45q tax credit,
2
which is available to taxpayers who capture carbon oxide from certain sources and then
sequester it in secure geological formations. guidance on the section 45q tax credit is still
developing but it is similar in structure to the production tax credit and investment tax credit
available to renewable energy projects (see “13.4.3.3 financial promotion of co2 emissions
reductionsandrenewableportfoliostandards”below).
13.4.3.3 financialpromotionofco emissionsreductionsandrenewableportfoliostandards
2
currently, renewableenergyprojects intheusarelyonthefederalproductiontaxcredit(“ptc”)
and investment tax credit (“itc”). the ptc is a tax credit per kwh for the first 10 years of
electricity generation applicable to wind projects in different ranges depending on the begin of
construction and was prolonged in december 2019 until 2020. the itc offers a tax credit to
projects regarding part of the investment costs at the start of a project. on june 26, 2020,
legislation was introduced into the us house of representatives that would extend the ptc until
2025andtheitcbeyond2027,ifadopted.
separate from federal tax programs and activities aimed at the development of clean energy,
many states have enacted and expanded ambitious rps and ces frameworks. for example, in
2015, hawaii enacted the first rps in the usa that mandates its electric utility companies to
acquire100%ofnetelectricity salesfromresbytheendof2045andvermontpasseda75%rps
target by end of 2032, rising to 90% by 2050. california updated its rps in 2018 to require 100%
of the electricity consumed in the state to come from carbon-free sources by 2045. in 2019, new
york passed the climate leadership and community protection act, requiring a 100% carbon
neutralpowersystemby2040andan85%reductioninghgby2050.newmexico,thedistrictof
columbia, maine, nevada, puerto rico, and washington have also recently adopted 100% clean
energy targets. governors in colorado, connecticut, illinois, rhode island, massachusetts,
minnesota, new jersey and wisconsin have also each committed to achieving 100% carbon-free
electricity, with targets for achieving that goal ranging from 2030 to 2050. in 2018, ten states
increased their rps and in 2019, the district of columbia, new mexico, nevada and maryland
increasedtheirtargetsaswell.
the promotion of carbon-free electricity sources is based on the states’ rps and on other state
regulatory policies, such as procurement schemes, which require utilities in the electricity sector
to bid for and contract directly with certain state-preferred energy types and sources. in june
2019, maine enacted a law to incentivize 375 mw of new distributed generation. at least five
states have so far adopted targets specifically for energy storage, including new york, which has
a current target to procure 3 gw of energy storage capacity by 2030. virginia’s recently passed
bill committing the commonwealth to 100% renewable energy by 2040 also includes an energy
390
storage deployment target of 2.7 gw by 2035. the amount of energy storage in the usa is
expected to double again in 2019 and by 2024; deployments are expected to exceed 4.4 gw. at
least five states have now adopted specific targets for energy storage, with new york’s target of
3 gw by 2030 being the most ambitious to date. other states have included energy storage in
theirplanningprocessesandcompetitivesolicitations.
to accommodate the increased implementation of electric storage resources, the federal energy
regulatory commission (“ferc”) issued order no. 841 in 2018 and directed regional grid
operators to remove barriers to the participation of electric storage resources in the organized
wholesale electricity markets by requiring the rtos and isos to establish market rules that
facilitate such participation and take into account the physical and operational characteristics of
electricstorageresources.
13.4.3.4 offshorewindexpansionplans
there is also considerable effort in the u.s. to foster the large-scale development and
deployment of offshore wind generation. in particular east coast states enacted ambitious
offshore wind generationtargets andprocurementobligations undertheir rpsandcesschemes.
the states of new york (climate leadership and community protection act, enacted on july 18,
2019, “clcpa”), new jersey (offshore wind development act, issued in january 2018 and
executive order no. 8 of january 31, 2018, and no. 92 of november 19, 2019) massachusetts (an
act to promote energy diversity, issued on august 8, 2016 and an act to advance clean energy,
issued on july 31, 2018), maryland (clean energy jobs act, enacted on may 29, 2019) and
connecticut (an act concerning the procurement of energy derived from offshore wind, issued
on june 7, 2019) enacted ambitious offshore wind targets and procurement obligations by way
oflegislative acts, virginia byway ofanexecutiveorder(executiveorderno.43of17september
2019). the largest commitment to offshore development can be found in the new york clcpa,
pursuant to which the state of new york targets the development of 9 gw in offshore wind
capacity by 2035. california, delaware, hawaii, maine, new hampshire and north carolina have
all also expressed interest in the deployment of offshore wind generation, with varying levels of
development. there is also interest in deploying offshore wind generation in inland waters, as
there are current plans for offshore wind generation development in lake erie near cleveland,
ohio.
13.4.3.5 infrastructureexpansionandregulation
under the federal power act, ferc oversees and regulates the interstate transmission of
electricity. ferc’s order no. 1000 adopted significant reforms of ferc’s transmission planning
andcost-allocation rules. order no.1000soughttoaddresssignificant recentchangesin thebulk
power industry, including an increased emphasis on integrating renewable generation and
reducing congestion, by implementing new policies to push transmission providers and planners
to seek more reliable, efficient and cost-efficient solutions. the major reforms of order no. 1000
include (i) requiring each public utility transmission provider to participate in a regional
transmission planning process that produces a regional transmission plan and regional and
interregional cost allocation methods for planned projects; (ii) requiring each public utility
transmission provider to amend its transmission tariff to describe procedures for considering
transmission needs driven by public policy requirements established by state or federal laws or
regulations, such as state rps; (iii) removing from ferc-approved tariffs and agreements any
federal right of first refusal for incumbent utilities to build and own certain new transmission
facilities;and(iv)improvingcoordinationbetweenneighboringtransmissionplanningregions.
order no. 1000 also provides that transmission upgrade cost allocations must be roughly
commensurate with the benefits received. ferc required public utility transmission providers to
begin making filings with ferc during 2012 that proposed revisions to their transmission
planning processes under their respective tariffs to comply with order no. 1000. throughout
2013, ferc issued orders regarding some of these compliance filings in which it accepted and
rejected various proposed revisions, including rejecting a number of proposals to retain certain
391
typesofrightsoffirstrefusalforincumbenttransmissionproviderstobuildandowntransmission
projectseligibleforsocializedcostrecovery.
the further course for large-scale transmission projects, including hvdc technology and financial
incentive regulation remains hard to predict. the draft clean future act aims to establish a
comprehensive national transmission policy designed to facilitate, in particular, a decarbonized
electricity supply, which, besides cost-effectivity, shall take into account and evaluate benefits
offered by interregional and regional transmission solutions. thereby, the draft aims to broadly
revise the respective ferc regulations and emphasize decarbonization and long-term efficiency.
by contrast, the aeia draft aims to direct ferc’s attention to energy storage with provisions
focusedonthedevelopmentofmicro-grids.
on april 2, 2020, ferc issued a proposed rulemaking to revise its existing transmission incentives
policy and corresponding regulations for certain types of transmission projects subject to
cost-of-serviceratemaking.theseincentivesinclude,amongotherthings,returnonequityadders
and possible recovery of costs for transmission projects abandoned for reasons beyond the
control of a transmission developer. in its proposed rulemaking ferc recognized that a number
of significant advancements in the development of new transmission facilities had occurred since
2006,whenfercformalizeditscurrentincentivepolicies.inparticular,amongotherthings,ferc
proposes to depart from the risks and challenges approach used to evaluate requests for
transmission incentives and instead focus on granting incentives based on the benefits to
consumers of transmission infrastructure investment, which is an important factor with regard to
establishing inter-regional hvdc transmission projects, such as long distance hvdc transmission
lines to transmit power from regions with significant renewable generation potential to distant
population and load centers. moreover, ferc proposes a separate return on equity incentive for
transmission projects that provide significant and demonstrable reliability benefits by providing
quantitative analysis, where possible, as well as qualitative analysis. if adopted, in particular
transmission projects that significantly increase import or export capability between balancing
authoritieswouldbeeligibleforadditionalincentives.

in may 2020, president trump issued an executive order prohibiting certain transactions
regarding bulk-power system electric equipment designed, developed, manufactured or supplied

adversary. the prohibition applies only to those transactions that pose: (i) an undue risk of

13.4.4 china
china’s long-term energy policy is characterized by commitments under the paris agreement,
which requires it to reduce carbon emissions per unit of gdp by 60 to 65% and increase the
non-fossil share of its primary energy consumption to 20% by 2030. these commitments have
beenincorporatedinto thenationalstrategyonenergyproductionandconsumptionrevolution
(2016-2030)ofapril25,2017(“ers”).
13.4.4.1 china’sfive-yearplan
china’s energy development targets are set out in the 13th five-year plan on energy
development (“energy 13th fyp”) based on the national 13th five-year plan and released by the
392
national energy administration (“nea”). it includes an energy consumption cap at five billion
tons of coal equivalents and a 15% target for the share of non-fossil-based energy in china’s
primary energy mix by the end of 2020. the associated 13th five-year plan for wind power and
the 13th five-year plan for solar power set respective targets of 210 gw and at least 160 gw of
installed power generation to be reached by the end of 2020. the energy 13th fyp also sets out

13.4.4.2 china’senergybill
on april 10, 2020, the nea released a consultative draft of a new energy law of the people’s
republic of china, which will merge all existing energy laws. it prioritizes the development and
utilization of res and aims to set further targets for the share of renewable energy generation
within china’s overall energy mix by establishing a binding renewable energy target mechanism
and a guaranteed consumption mechanism for res. the bill also stresses that china will
strengthen its supervision ofpollutants andghgemissions. additionally, wholesale energyprices
will begradually liberalized. however, thebillmerelyconstitutesaframeworklawthathastobe

specificsontheregulatoryobjectivesareunclear.
13.4.4.3 conventionalpowergenerationregulation
the energy 13th fyp sets a 1,100 gw cap for coal-fired power generation by the end of 2020. in
addition, the legal framework for construction and operation of carbon intensive energy
generation facilities, in particular coal-based power plants, is becoming more stringent. on
march 17, 2016, the nea established a “traffic light” system to curtail the construction of new
coal-fired power plants. on the basis of factors such as resource constraints, coal plant
profitability and existing coal-fired power capacity, the nea assesses whether provinces must
immediately halt all new coal plant construction projects or may (cautiously) proceed with
approvals and constructions. in 2019, the nea published the results of an “early warning” report
for coal power in 2022 that indicated that ten provinces and regions would have an excess of
coal-fired electricity generationcapacity by2022,which is asharpreduction fromits21provinces
in the early warning for 2021 issued in 2018. consequently, eleven areas were permitted to start
buildingcoal-firedpowerplantsagain.

wholesale prices for energy are strictly regulated in china based on its electric power law, but
market-based mechanisms have been gradually introduced to liberalize the energy market.
under the previous scheme, the national development and reform commission (“ndrc”)
determined the wholesale price for energy generated by coal-fired power plants by a power on
grid tariff and a corresponding coal price pass-through mechanism. on september 26, 2019,
china announced it would terminate this scheme for coal-fired power plants by 2020 and

13.4.4.4 emissiontradingsystem
in december 2017, china launched a national emission trading system (“chinese ets”), to be
implemented by the end of 2020. currently, the chinese ets covers only coal-fired power
generation facilities but it is intended to be expanded to cover petrochemical, chemical, building
materials, steel, nonferrous metals, paper and domestic aviation. when fully implemented, the
chinese ets will cover eight billion tons of co emissions per annum from around 100,000
2
industrial plants. the ministry of ecology and environment will allocate allowances, thereby
taking into account not only emission targets but also economic growth and structure
adjustments. the chinese ets will not feature an overall cap on co emissions. instead, every

emit per unit of electricity it generates. plants that fall below their benchmark will have excess
quota to sell, noncompliance will lead to significant sanctions. the chinese ets therefore
incentivizes energy efficiency rather than the decrease of the overall fossil-based energy
generation.
13.4.4.5 nuclearpowerstrategy
besides coal and gas-fired power generation, china continues to rely on nuclear energy. after a
moratoriumonnewnuclearpowerplantsfollowingthe2011fukushimaaccident,chinaresumed
its nuclear power strategy. the energy development strategy action plan, passed by the state
council in 2014, sets a target for installed nuclear power capacity of 58 gw and 30 gw for
nuclear power capacity under construction by 2020. however, the expansion depends on further
decisionsatthepoliticallevel.
13.4.4.6 renewableenergygenerationexpansiontargets
the ers stipulates that china is aiming for non-fossil power generation to account for at least
31%ofelectricityconsumptionbytheendof2020andatleast50%by2030.
on may 10, 2019 the nea and the ndrc released a renewable energy obligation policy, the
notice establishing a mandatory renewable electricity consumption mechanism, imposing
provincial renewable energy consumption quota ranging from 10% in eastern provinces to 88%
in southwestern provinces (renewable portfolio standard targets) to promote renewable energy
consumption. these targets are binding for state owned or provincial grid companies as well as
large end-users. in january 2017, the ndrc, the nea and the chinese ministry of finance jointly
issued the trial mechanism on issuing and trading renewable energy green certificates which
electricity consumers can voluntarily purchase to achieve their renewable portfolio standard
targets. parties that outperformed their quota obtain tradable renewable energy certificates
whichtheymayselltopartiesthatfailedtomeettheirquotas.
13.4.4.7 renewableenergygenerationsupportschemes
the support scheme for renewable energy generation has undergone significant changes in
recentyearswithaparticulartrendtowardsasubsidy-freerespowergeneration.
wind and solar-based power generation development in china has mainly been driven by policy
support such as feed-in tariffs, local subsidies, demonstration projects and high targets of
installed capacity. according to the feed-in tariff system, the wholesale price for renewable
energy consists of the coal-fired power on grid tariff and an additional remuneration dependent
on various factors, in particular wind or solar resources and energy demand. under the market-
based electricity pricing structure introduced in 2020, the wholesale base price set by the
authoritiesreplacesthecoal-firedpowerongridtariffaspointofreferenceforsubsidies.
regarding subsidies for solar pv, the nea has handed out annual quota to each province and
only installations covered by the annual quota are eligible to receive subsidies through feed-in
tariffs on the basis of tender procedures. to curb the increase of solar pv and to adjust to the
decreased manufacturing costs, feed-in tariffs have been lowered in recent years and halved in
2020.
394
wind power projects, onshore and offshore, must compete for construction quotas and feed-in
tariffs through tender procedures as well since the ndrc has released a bidding feed-in tariff
scheme for wind power generation in 2019 replacing fixed feed-in tariffs. under the scoring
system of the bidding feed-in tariff scheme, the bidding price constitutes only one out of six
relevant factors in addition to grid connection, preliminary work, project design, technology
excellence and investor capability. however, new offshore power projects starting construction
after january 1, 2021 will no longer receive subsidies from the central government, but local
governments may still subsidize these projects. onshore wind power projects will become
subsidy-freeby2021.
furthermore, on january 7, 2019, ndrc and nea jointly announced the plan to launch subsidy-
free wind and solar pilots in regions with superior wind or solar resources and power
consumption capability which are not confined to the annual capacity cap. for those pilot
projects, grid companies should give grid-access priority and ensure full uptake of the electricity
output. in order to promote pilot projects, further incentives apply, in particular regarding land
userights.
13.4.4.8 furtherpoliciestosupportrenewableenergygeneration
despite the paradigm shift regarding the subsidization of res, china continues to strengthen its
market position in green technologies. in april 2019, the ndrc and the ministry of science and
technology jointly issued the guidance on building a market-oriented green technology
innovation system (“green technology guidance”), containing measures that relevant
government bodies should implement by 2022 to accelerate green innovation in china. the
greentechnologyguidance,inparticular,requiresmoreeffortstoenhancefinancialsupportand
encourage companies to participate in government supported and market oriented projects in
greentechnologyinnovationthroughfinancialincentivesandimprovediprights.
to further reduce its ghgemissions in the heating sector caused by coal heating systems, china’s
government in 2017 introduced the clean winter heating plan in northern china (2017-2021)

13.4.4.9 infrastructureexpansion
due to the increased deployment of res, china’s energy infrastructure faces new challenges. in
particular, renewable energy generation results in high volatility of feed-in energy, as wind and
solar energy generation is weather-dependent. hence, the demand for energy storage increases
owing to the rising need for grid resilience and stability. to support further growth in res and
meet increased demand for energy storage due to the weather dependency of res, the ndrc
released the 2019-2020 action plan to guide the technological and industrial development of
the energy storage sector (ndrc 2019, no. 725). the plan aims to promote and develop energy
storage capacities and technology by improving the legal framework for energy storage projects
andencouragingdemonstrationprojects.
power grid expansion planning is essential to balance energy demand and generation as well as
transmission capacity. hence, the grid planning process carried out by the nea considers policy
objectives such as renewable energy deployment targets as well as the growing demand for
energy. the planning results in a final national power plan issued by the nea after being
approved by the ndrc. the 2015-2020 power grid construction and reform plan released by the
nea in july 2015 provides for a cumulative infrastructure investment of approximately rmb 2
trillion by 2020. additionally, in november 2018, the ndrc and the nea jointly released the
clean energy consumption action plan according to which china will invest significantly in grid
395
infrastructure in order to reduce curtailment rates and expand energy transmission capacities. at
the same time china plans to expand its high voltage regional ac grid to absorb the output of
the hvdc lines. as regional grids are ac grids but transmission grids use dc technology, china is
in the process of developing a hybrid ac-dc grid system and at the same time plans further
investmentsinsmartgridinfrastructure.
13.5 market access regulations
13.5.1 publicprocurementlaw
we conduct a large share of our business with governments and government-owned enterprises.
the award of contracts with such entities is commonly subject to public procurement laws which
are found in international, european and national legislation. public procurement laws generally
require public entities, sectoral contracting entities and concession grantors to award contracts
and concessions in a transparent andnon-discriminatory tenderprocedure,dependentoncertain
thresholds.tenderobligationsalsoapplytomaterialamendmentstoexistingcontracts.incaseof

onaninternationallevel,manyofthecountriesintowhichwedeliverourproductsareboundby
public procurement provisions of the government procurement agreement (übereinkommen
über das öffentliche beschaffungswesen, “gpa”). at the european level, directive (ec) 2014/24
on public procurement applies. germany has implemented the international and european rules
into national procurement law, particularly in form of the german act against restrictions of
competition(gesetzgegenwettbewerbsbeschränkungen).
in the u.s., the federal acquisition regulation sets out the policies and procedures for
acquisitions by all federal departments and agencies and implements or addresses nearly every
procurement-related u.s. statute or executive policy. public procurement in canada is regulated
on various governmental levels (federal, provincial, municipal), including the code of conduct of
procurement, the federal accountability act and the financial administration act. in china, the
government procurement law and the law on tenders and bids set the legal framework for
public procurement. the brazilian constitution requires a public procurement procedure for all
purchases and sales made and all services and works commissioned by public administration.
brazilian federal law 8,666/1993 provides the general framework for these procedures. the usa,
canada,chinaandbrazilhaveeachimplementedregulationsondomesticpreferenceofnational

preferences may be mitigated by multilateral and bilateral trade agreements like the gpa, which

13.5.2 exportcontrolandsanctionsregulations
13.5.2.1 internalmarketandcustoms
within the europeanunion’s internal market, theprinciple offreemovementofgoodsgenerally
applies. when importing from and exporting goods to non-eu countries, we must comply with
nationalandeuropeanaswellasinternationalexportcontrollawsandcustomsregulations.
at the eu level, the regulatory framework concerning customs is the union customs code
(regulation (eu) 952/2013), with powers of customs authorities being further set out in national
laws of the member states. in germany, details are regulated in the german customs
administration act (zollverwaltungsgesetz), according to which customs controls may consist of,
among other things: (i) examining goods, (ii) verifying the accuracy and completeness of
information given in a declaration or notification, (iii) verifying the existence, authenticity,
accuracy and validity of documents, (iv) inspecting means of transport, luggage and other goods
carriedbyoronpersons,and(v)carryingoutofficialenquiriesandothersimilaracts.

13.5.2.2 foreigntradeanddualusegoods
as we sell our products and provide our services to customers worldwide, we are subject to the
restrictions ofseveralexportcontrolregulations.inaddition,weprocuregoodsandservicesfrom
suppliers worldwide which might also be subject to export restrictions. in germany, exporting
companies have to comply with european and german export control regulations, applicable
dependingon(i)thekindofproductandthepurposeforwhichtheproducthasbeendeveloped,
(ii) the country of destination and (iii) the intended use of the exported goods. exports are
supervised by the federal office for economic affairs and export control (bundesamt für
wirtschaft und ausfuhrkontrolle, “bafa”). applicable legislation includes the german foreign
trade and payments act (außenwirtschaftsgesetz), the german foreign trade and payments
ordinance (außenwirtschaftsverordnung), and regulation (ec) 428/2009 setting up a community
regime for the control of exports, brokering and transit of dual-use items (“dual use
regulation”).
in germany, dependingon the kind of goodsandservices, thepurposefor which thegoodshave
been designed, the country of destination and the intended use, exports may be subject to
license requirements or control measures by the bafa. authorizations are, inter alia, mandatory
for the export of goods and services that are listed in the dual use regulation, but may also be
required for non-listed goods or services if these goods or services are intended to be used for
certain military or nuclear purposes. the latter may, in particular, be the case for control and
instrumentationequipmentthatweproduceforpowerplants.
13.5.2.3 embargoesandtradesanctions
when selling and/or delivering our products to customers around the globe we must observe
economic sanctions and embargoes. such measures can be based on national legislation (like in
germany, the uk or the usa), but also on acts of supranational organizations like the european
union and the united nations. they can take the form of comprehensive embargoes (total
embargoes), partial embargoes, such as arms, sectoral or financial embargoes and may be
directed at countries, organizations, groups, non-state entities and individuals. person-related
sanctions usually prohibit placing assets of any kind at the disposal of sanctioned parties or
providingthemwithanyeconomicresources.
in the usa, the u.s. customs and border protection agency, among others, regulates the import
and export of goods from the usa. imports are governed by a number of laws, including the
tariff act of 1930. the u.s. departments of justice, commerce, state and treasury and other
federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek
to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export
controls laws, anti-money laundering laws and other federal statutes and regulations, including
thoseestablishedbytheu.s.departmentoftreasury’sofficeofforeignassetscontrol(“ofac”).
various government agencies may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including
cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities as
well as modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may
subjectustofines,penaltiesandothersanctions.
moreover, in november 2018, the u.s. announced it would withdraw from the joint
comprehensive plan of action which had previously eased u.s. sanctions on iran under the
authority of, among others, the iran sanctions act, the comprehensive iran sanctions,
accountability and divestment act of 2010, the national defense authorization act for fiscal
year 2012, the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012, the iran freedom and
counter-proliferation act of 2012, and various executive orders. in broad terms, the u.s. have
re-imposed u.s. extraterritorial sanctions measures against iran in connection with activity
related to iran’s energy, petrochemical, automotive, shipping, shipbuilding, port operating and
financial sectors. personsengagedin suchactivities involving iran will faceexposuretosecondary
sanctionsorenforcementactionsunderu.s.law.
u.s. trade sanctions have been particularly relevant regarding our business with cuba, iran and
venezuela, because we have to ensure that no u.s. goods, persons or companies are involved in
397
such transactions, not even indirectly. the u.s. sanctions apply primarily to u.s. persons, which,
inter alia, include all companies and other legal entities organized under u.s. law as well as
permanent residents. in the case of the cuba and iran sanctions programs, the u.s. sanctions also
apply to non-u.s.-entities owned or controlled by u.s. persons. the united states have also
imposed primary sanctions on certain russian individuals, companies and sectors of the russian
economy.
besidescountryorterritory-basedandsectoralsanctions(which,e.g.,targetcertainsectorsofthe
russian economy), the u.s. government also imposes list-based sanctions against certain entities
and individuals, including through the list of specially designated nationals andblockedpersons
administered by ofac. the obligation to screen u.s. sanctions lists may also follow from
contracts with suppliers, credit facilities or loan agreements that require compliance with u.s.
sanctionsorscreeningagainstu.s.sanctionslists.
in addition, u.s. sanctions may also have an extraterritorial effect and apply even to non-“u.s.
persons” as defined above (so-called “secondary sanctions”), if such entity or individual
undertakes certain transactions or activities which are subject to a set of sanctions to be imposed
by u.s. administration. for example, as a result of the countering america’s adversaries through
sanctions act of 2017, non-u.s. persons must comply with certain secondary sanctions against
russia, even if such activities have no connection to the u.s. among other things, non-u.s.
persons may face penalties for knowingly facilitating significant transactions or significant
financial transactions for or on behalf of a party subject to the united states’ sanctions against
russia. further, non-u.s. persons and entities that cause a u.s. person to violate u.s. sanctions
may also violate the u.s. sanctions for facilitation reasons and risk civil and criminal penalties
under applicable u.s. law. accordingly, transacting business with customers in particular
countries such as cuba may be allowed under eu law but still violate u.s. sanctions. in case of
suchconflicts betweeneulawandu.s.sanctions,theblockingstatute(ec)2271/96(asamended)
prohibits eu companies from complying with certain listed u.s. sanctions and shields these
entitiesfromtheeffectsofu.s.sanctionsintheeu.suchanti-boycottrulesapply,forexample,to
the 2018 u.s. sanctions targeting iran. eu companies are, nonetheless, free to conduct their
businessastheyseefit,i.e.,nottradewithcountriessanctionedbytheu.s.
eu trade sanctions have a broad scope, applying (i) within the territory of the member states,
(ii) to any person inside or outside the territory of the european union who is a national of a
member state, (iii) to any legal person, entity or body which is incorporated or constituted under
the law of a member state whether acting inside or outside the european union, and (iv) to any
legal person, entity, or body in respect of any business done in whole or in part within the
europeanunion.
in recent years, our business has been particularly affected by eu sanctions against russia which
apply alongside and in addition to u.s. sanctions. the embargoes limit the freedom of foreign
trade with the embargoed countries. they also prohibit that funds, other financial assets and
economic resources be made available directly or indirectly to or for the benefit of a natural or
legal person, group or entity included in the list of restricted parties of that embargoed country,
or by prohibiting goods, services, financial or other related services from being rendered for the
benefit of restricted parties of that embargoed country. these examples reflect the current legal
situation only, which is, however, subject to frequent changes as sanctions lists are updated on a
regularbasis.
13.5.3 financingofprojects,exportsupportandstateaid
13.5.3.1 financingandexportsupport
as exporter of goods produced in numerous global manufacturing plants, we make use of
different national export credit agencies (“ecas”) which support and promote national exports
byproviding risk coveragefor lendersandexporters.forecasfromoecd-membercountries,the
arrangement on officially supported export credits (“oecd consensus”) applies and defines the
framework for ecas projects, including rules for financial support regarding things like coal-
398
fired or nuclear power plants, renewable energy, climate change mitigation and adaptation and
water projects. as another example, european governments support certain exports into third
countries using specific export credit guarantees if no other insurance is available for such
exports. in connection with the oecd consensus, these ecas introduced eca-specific rules and
regulations. we have to comply with these different terms and conditions in order to benefit
from the eca support. because of our manufacturing locations in the usa and canada, we can
also be supported by us and canadian ecas for which again the oecd consensus, but also
nationaleca-specificrulesandregulationsapply.ourcustomersalsousevarioussourcesoffunds

banks, other financial institutions, public bodies or private investors. these entities and their
financing products can be subject to rules and regulations of financial regulators, central banks
andotherentitieswithregulatorypower.
there is a trend that providers of funds, including public body lenders, ecas and development
banks, are introducing environmental and social governance frameworks and related lending
policiestoincreasetheirfundingofrenewableenergyandclimatechangemitigationprojects.at
the sametime, manyofthemreducefinancial supportfor fossil fuel basedpowerplants ormake

ourbusinessistheworldbank’sdecisionstoendfinancingofcoal-firedpowerplantsin2013and
to end financial support for oil and gas extraction in 2020 in principle. also the eib has
announced it will cease funding energy projects based on fossil fuels, including new gas plants,
by the end of 2021 and only allow funding for certain low-emission gas projects with emissions
not exceeding 250 g co per kwh. currently, the usa supports fossil fuel based operations
2
through things like tax advantages, but in 2019, several bills were introduced into the legislative
process which aim at reforming or repealing support for fossil fuels, such as the clean energy for
america act or the energy sector innovation credit act. as of the date of this prospectus, these
had not yet been adopted. governments of certain canadian provinces allow companies to pay
reduced royalty for the extraction of natural gas in order to encourage investments in gas
extractiontechnology.
13.5.3.2 stateaid
occasionally,wecarryoutorparticipateinprojectsthatarepartlyfinancedbypublicfunds,most
recently in germany, canada and china. these projects usually have an energy-related
background such as installation of space reductions for grid connections, waste heat recovery or
use of hydrogen in manufacturing processes. within the past three fiscal years, we have received
governmentgrantsinanoverallamountoflessthan€30millionforsuchprojectsperyear.
in the eu, any state aid has to comply with eu state aid rules which require the respective eu
member state to notify and seek approval from the eu commission. whenever we benefit from
public grants we have to comply with different terms and conditions of grant decisions and
applicable collateral clauses, in particular regarding the use of funds for specific funding
purposes, documentation obligations, employment commitments, exploitation periods and/or
transfer restrictions, as the case may be. failure to comply with the notification requirement or
with theterms andconditions ofthegrantdecisions mayresult in anobligation torepaytheaid.
similarly, in canada, government financing programs provide public funds for certain projects, in
particular r&d funding. in china, the anti-monopoly law prohibits the abuse of administrative
powerstoeliminateorrestrictcompetitionandrelatedlawenforcementpractice.
13.6 data privacy
we are subject to stringent data privacy regulations, inter alia, with respect to the collection,
storage, use and disclosure of personal data. although we predominantly operate in a b2b
environment where our customers are not usually end consumers but legal entities outside the
scope of dataprivacy legislation in most countries, nevertheless ourcustomer service mayinclude
processing of personal data on behalf of our customers (such as customers’ employee data, data
of third parties acting on our customers’ behalf or personal data of our customers’ end
399
consumers). the same applies mutatis mutandis to our suppliers. in addition, our systems and
productsprocessdifferenttypesandspecialcategoriesofpersonaldata,forexamplewithrespect
toemployeeswedealwithdataregardinghealth,religiousbeliefstradeunionmemberships,and
disabilities. we may also deal with personal data of other natural persons having a legitimate
interest,consentorotherlegalbasistoourbusiness.
privacy regulations establish complex, multi-jurisdictional regulatory frameworks on a variety of
subjectsincludingthecircumstancesunderwhichwemayprocessthepersonaldata.thiscomplex
framework involves (i) conflicting privacy laws and regulations in different countries, (ii) the
circumstances under which processing of sensitive information is permitted without consent of
the data subject, (iii) rights of the data subject to access, delete and correct its personal data,
(iv) requirements to notify the data subject of privacy practices for personal data and
(v) administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that process personal
data.
for example, when processing personal data in the european economic area we are subject to
the general data protection regulation (eu) 2016/679 (“gdpr”) and respective implementing
legislation under national laws of member states, like in germany the federal data protection
act (bundesdatenschutzgesetz, “bdsg”). both the gdpr and bdsg have been applicable since
may25,2018.thegdprhassignificantlychangedthelegalframeworkfordataprotectioninthe
eu and triggered additional compliance efforts and costs for german companies in general. a
large part of our data processing operations consist of exchanges of personal data among our
group companies in different countries (“intragroup exchange”). intragroup exchange of
personal data to a country outside the european economic area for which the eu commission
has not recognized an adequate level of data protection (“third country”) is only permissible if
the recipient in the third country ensures adequate safeguards for the protection of personal
data. regarding data transfers to the usa, the european court of justice in a judgement of
july 16, 2020 (schrems ii) annulled the eu-us privacy shield as basis for such transfer. tranfers to
any third country can henceforth only be based on standard contractual clauses (“scc”) or
binding corporate rules (“bcr”). however, in view of the court even sccs require the data
exporter and the data importer to verify the adequate level of protection in the third country
and where necessary take supplementary measures or suspend data transfers. in view of the
european data protection board, this also applies to bcr. as of the date of this prospectus, we
are assessing in which cases supplementary measures may be required or the ways we process
personal data may have to be adjusted and closely monitor the guidance expected to be
providedbythedataprotectionauthoritiesontheconsequencesofthejudgement.
we have implemented different measures in order to achieve compliance (including, but not
limited to, adjustments of internal processes, safeguarding of internal and external data
transfers, entering into data protection contracts, and monitoring by our legal and compliance
team) and are further developing our data protection systems, procedures and organization, for
example by designation of data protection officers where required by data protection laws or
internal data privacy managers in other jurisdictions. for the intragroup exchange of personal
datatoathirdcountry,wewillusethesiemensagbindingcorporaterulesbysigningadoption

its affiliated companies located within the eea, and (ii) affiliated companies located outside the
eeaifthepersonaldataoriginatefrom(a)siemensenergyagor(b)affiliatedcompanieslocated
within the eea. in addition, we use an intercompany agreement for protection of personal data
in company-wide it systems (“framework agreement personal data”), which applies among and
between all siemens energy ag group companies. the framework agreement personal data
regulatesprocessinganduseofpersonaldataaswellastechnicalandorganizationalmeasuresto
protect such data in accordance with data protection requirements. the gdpr introduced
substantial sanctions for non-compliance. a violation of obligations under the gdpr may
constitute an administrative offense which can result in fines or investigative measures imposed
by the competent data protection authority as well as civil liabilities or even criminal sanctions.
the it application to which the framework agreement personal data applies is specified and
described in a data processing description, which together with the framework agreement
400
personal data forms the data processing agreement between and amongthesiemens energyag
companiesonprocessingpersonaldataforaspecifieditapplication.
regarding our business in the usa, we are subject to numerous federal and state privacy laws
with general prohibitions on unfair or deceiving practices, including the prohibition to handle
personal data in an unexpected manner and including data protection for specific sectors. there
are specific rules on cybersecurity and notification requirements in case of a data breach. each
state has developed its own data breach notification requirements. data privacy and protection
laws are evolving in the u.s. and can vary significantly. for example, california recently
implemented the california consumer privacy act (“ccpa”) which added further requirements
and penalties in the collection of california residents’ personal data. the ccpa applies to
businessescollecting personaldataofcaliforniaresidentsandrequiresthemtodisclosehowthey
process the personal data of california residents. furthermore, the ccpa provides california
residents with additional data privacy rights including the right to access and delete their
personal data. federal and state regulators are actively enforcing these requirements. the
authorities mayfor non-compliance with federalorstate privacy laws impose substantial fines. in
addition, private parties may start lawsuits, including class-actions, based on tort law and
standardsrelatingtounfairanddeceptiveactsandpractices.
private sector organizations in canada are governed by both federal and provincial privacy laws.
the federal personal information protection and electronic documents act (“pipeda”) applies to
personal information related to commercial activities, i.e., customers, vendors and business
partners.pipedaneitherappliestopersonalinformationofemployeesnortoprovincesthathave
substantially similar legislation. as of the date of this prospectus, similar legislation is in place in
the provinces of quebec, british columbia and alberta, with ontario, new brunswick, nova
scotia, and newfoundland and labrador having privacy legislation for health information which
has been declared substantially similar to pipeda. all other provinces have not enacted
substantially similar health information legislation and are, therefore, subject to pipeda. in
addition, some provinces have passed privacy laws that apply to employee information. asofthe
date of this prospectus, these provinces are alberta and british columbia. in all cases, both
federal and provincial privacy laws must be adhered to. pipeda requires organizations operating
in canada to nominate a data privacy officer and implement a privacy panel as well as having
databreachnotification policies andproceduresin place. our canadiancompanies haveadopted
the most stringent data protection requirements in ordertoavoidhavingtoimplement different
policiesandproceduresinprovinceshavingtheirownsubstantiallysimilardataprivacylaws.
regarding our activities in china, we are bound by chinese data privacy law which consists of
numerousandindustry-specific regulations complementedbystandards.inaddition,dataprivacy
considerations can be inferred from general principles of civil law including tort law. the legal
landscape is complex and subject to frequent changes. therefore, uncertainty remains as to the
specific application of chinese data privacy law as well as to the practical steps needed in order
to achieve compliance. on march 6, 2020, china’s state administration for market supervision
and state standardisation published revised personal data protection best practice guidelines
comprising recommended national standards for personal information security and aims to
regulatethecollection,storage,use,sharing,transferanddisclosureofpersonalinformation.
13.7 anti-bribery, anti-corruption, antitrust and competition
wearesubjecttoanti-corruption,anti-bribery,anti-moneylaundering,antitrustandcompetition
laws. any violation of these laws in any jurisdiction in which we operate may have serious
consequences for entities and/orindividuals participating in suchmisconduct. forexample, under
german criminal law we must adhere to rules against corruption and bribery of public officials
(sections332,334ofthegermancriminal code(strafgesetzbuch))orprivatesectoremployeesor
business representatives (section 299 of the german criminal code) as well as rules against the
taking and giving of bribes meant as an incentive to violating one’s official duties (sections 331,
333 of the german criminal code). these provisions may under certain conditions also apply to
circumstances that occur solely or partly on foreign territory. on june 16, 2020, the german
401
federal government adopted a bill revising the overall framework for sanctioning corporations
(verbandssanktionengesetz)includingincreasedfines,whichisnowgoingthroughthelegislative
process. furthermore, the uk bribery act 2010 established company liability for corrupt acts
committed by persons acting on behalf of the company. the act prohibits bribery of public
officials and business-to-business bribery. with global jurisdiction, companies can be held liable
in the uk for acts of corruption committed by employees, agents or subsidiaries anywhere in the
world. in the usa, under the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended (“fcpa”), it is
also prohibited to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or
retaining business. the anti-bribery provisions of the fcpa now also apply to foreign firms and
persons who cause, directly or through agents, an act in furtherance of such a corrupt payment
to take place within the territory of the united states. the chinese criminal law prohibits
“official bribery” which applies to a state functionary or an entity as well as “commercial
bribery” which applies to non-state functionaries. under the brazilian criminal code and
brazilian anti-bribery law, individuals and legal entities can be liable for bribery of public
officialsinbrazil.
we are also subject to various antitrust and competition laws. in a broader sense these laws
include all legal provisions that concern the protection of a diverse and free competition.
antitrust law, in particular, aims to protect free competition. national and supranational
authorities that monitor compliance with antitrust and competition laws may initiate
investigations and proceedings into alleged infringements, such as anti-competitive agreements
between undertakings or the abuse of a dominant market position. violations of antitrust and
competition laws can have various consequences including criminal sanctions, administrative
fines, disgorgement of profits, exclusion from public tenders, nullity of agreements and civil
claims for damages. antitrust and competition laws in individual jurisdictions may also include
rules requiring the approval by antitrust authorities regarding mergers and acquisitions or joint
venturesandenabletheauthoritiestoimposecertainconditionsorobligationsinthesecases.

14 general information on the company and the
siemens energy group
14.1 formation, incorporation, commercial register, name
the company was established by blitzstart holding ag on july 27, 2016 under the legal name
“blitz 16-806 gmbh” in the form of a limited liability company (gesellschaft mit beschränkter
haftung) under german law and registered in the commercial register of the local court
(amtsgericht) of munich under hrb 227428. siemens acquired all shares of the company on
august 9, 2016. subsequently, the company’s legal name was changed to “kyros 52 gmbh” and
itsstatutoryseatwasmovedtohanoverwhereitwasregisteredinthecommercialregisterofthe

company’s legal form was changed to a stock corporation (aktiengesellschaft), its seat was
movedtomunichanditslegalnamewaschangedto“siemensenergyag”.asofthedateofthe
prospectus, the company is registered in the commercial register of the local court (amtsgericht)
ofmunichunderhrb252581.
the company’s commercial name is “siemens energy”. in addition, some of the company’s
subsidiaries use other commercial names reflecting other important group brands, in particular
“siemensgamesa”.
14.2 our history
as siemens energy, we continue siemens’ history in the energy business which began over 150
years ago. its technological origins are marked by an innovation with which werner von siemens
revolutionized electrical engineering in 1866. building on the work of michael faraday, he
discovered the dynamoelectric principle and designed the predecessor of modern large
generators: the dynamo machine. after around ten years of development and testing, the
dynamomachine was readyfor series productionin 1875.this was thebeginningofanewerain
the history of electrical engineering. the possibility of being able to generate and distribute
electrical energy in large quantities in an economical way fundamentally changed the economy.
1866 can therefore rightly be regarded as the actual founding year of siemens energy. since
then, many technological milestones, of which only a small selection is mentioned here, are part
ofourheritage.
the construction and equipping of conventional power plants is the first pillar. in 1881,
siemens & halske supplied electrical equipment including generators for the world’s first public
power plant in the southern english town of godalming. in 1897, south africa’s first public
power plant was completed and many other power plant projects followed. power engineering
alsocontributedtosiemens’returntoworldmarketsafterworldwari:in1929,theardnacrusha
hydroelectric power plant on the shannon river went into operation, thus ensuring the
electrificationofthefreestateofireland.atalmostthesametime,siemensbuiltthewestpower
plant in berlin with a capacity of 228 megawatts (mw), the most modern thermal power plant in
europe at the time. after world war ii in 1956, the first siemens gas turbine, the “vm1,” was
testedinmuelheimanderruhr.
in the mid-1950s, siemens entered the nuclear business with its first test facilities and in 1969
received an order to build the world’s then largest nuclear power plant in biblis near worms,
germany. in 1969, siemens and aeg founded kraftwerk union ag, into which both parties
transferred their nuclear technology operations in 1973 and which siemens fully consolidated
into siemens ag after aeg’s withdrawal in 1987. in 2011, siemens decided to discontinue its
businessactivitiesinturnkeynuclearpowerplants.
in 2002, as part of siemens’ acquisition of mannesmann atecs ag, siemens acquired the
turbocompressor business of mannesmann demag delaval. this business was merged into the
industrial turbines and power plants division. in 2003, siemens purchased alstom industrial
turbines; a manufacturer of small, medium and industrial gas turbines. in 2018, siemens
completed work on the world’s three largest ccpps in egypt which increased power generation
403
capacity by 14.4 gw – enough to reliably and efficiently supply up to 40 million people with
electricalenergy.
transmission technology has long been a second important pillar for siemens, in which it has
always sought to set standards. prominent examples of its contribution to the field include the
development of the expansion switch in 1930 or the first sf high-voltage switch in 1964. these
6
and other developments significantly contributed to efficient, reliable and flexible power
distribution. an important highlight was the construction of the first hvdc transmission system
in1975,whichsupportedsiemens’strongtechnologyandmarketpositioninpowertransmission.
in2015,siemens,workinginaconsortiumwiththeitaliancablemanufacturerprysmian,installed
the first offshore grid connection worldwide that began commercial operations using high-
voltagedctransmissiontechnology.
in 1978, the construction at the time of the world’s largest hydroelectric power plant italpú in
brazil on the border between brazil and paraguay demonstrated the potential renewables can
have for electricity generation – a third important pillar of our offering. in 1994, a ceramic high-
temperature fuel cell from siemens achieved an output of 1.8 kilowatts (kw) for the first time
worldwide. in 2012, we built the world’s then largest rotor for the 6-mw offshore wind power
plantnearøsterild in denmark.finally, in 2019,theworld’s largestpilotplantforcarbon-neutral
production of hydrogen at that time (source: power engineering international, “world’s largest
“green”hydrogenpilotbeginsoperationinaustria”,november19,2019)wentintooperationin
linz,austria.
in addition to these technological developments, the siemens energy business has also reached
numerous organizational milestones: the success of heavy current engineering strongly
supported the business of siemens & halske. halske’s heavy current department merged with
elektrizitäts-aktiengesellschaft (eag) to form siemens-schuckertwerke gmbh. the two world
wars were followed by a phase of reconstruction and corporate consolidation, which culminated
in the founding of siemens ag in 1966. in 1998, siemens acquired the fossil fuel power plant
business of the american westinghouse group, thereby expanding its conventional power plant
business. in 2004, the acquisition of the danish company bonus energy a/s laid the foundation
for success in the wind power business. in 2014, siemens acquired the rolls-royce aero-derivative
gas turbine and compressor business, thereby broadening its position in the oil and gas industry.
in 2015, siemens closed its acquisition of the u.s. company dresser-rand, a leading provider of
compressors, steam andgasturbines. in 2017,siemens andiberdrola s.a. createdsgre,aleading
wind energy company with global reach and production sites on all continents. following
spin-off completion, drawing on siemens’ history in the field, siemens energy will open a new
chapterofenergytechnology.

also provide for the issuer’s right to grant the holders or creditors, in whole or in part, no par
value shares in the company or shares in another listed company instead of payment of the
amount of money due upon final maturity of the bond associated with option rights or

in the case of warrant bonds, option rights shall be attached to each bond certificate, in
particular in the form of one or more warrants, entitling the holder/creditor to subscribe to
siemens energy conversion shares, subject to the terms and conditions of the bonds. in the case
413
of convertible bonds, the holders/creditors of the convertible bonds shall be entitled and/or
obliged to convert them into siemens energy conversion shares, subject to the terms and
conditions of the bonds. in all cases, the conversion ratio or the exchange or subscription ratio is
obtained by dividing the principal amount or the lower issue price of a convertible bond, or if a
warrant is exercised, the amount owed under its terms and conditions, by the conversion or
option price stipulated for one siemens energy conversion share. the pro rata amount of the
share capital represented by the shares to be subscribed for on the basis of one convertible bond
or, in the case of an exchange, of one warrant bond, must not exceed the principal amount or

the conversion/option price per share applicable at the time of issue must, except in cases of a
conversion obligation, not be less than 80.0% of the price of the shares as quoted in xetra
trading (or a comparable successor system). the calculation shall be based on the average closing
price over the ten trading days prior to the date on which the executive board finally resolves to
issue the bonds or on the company’s notice of acceptance following a public request for
submission of subscription offers. if shareholders’ subscription rights are not excluded, the price
on the trading days during the subscription period can be used as the basis instead (with the
exception of the days in the subscription period necessary to publish the conversion/option price
on time in accordance with section 186 paragraph 2 of the german stock corporation act
(aktiengesetz)). in cases of bonds with a conversion obligation, the conversion price may at least
either equal the minimum price set out above or correspond to the average volume-weighted
price of the shares in xetra trading (or a comparable successor system) on at least three trading
days immediately prior to calculation of the conversion price as defined in more detail by the
terms and conditions of the bonds, even if this average price and the applicable conversion price
derived from it is below the minimum price (80.0%) set out above. section 9 paragraph 1 and
section199paragraph2ofthegermanstockcorporationact(aktiengesetz)remainunaffected.

agreement for the time period after spin-off completion. therefore, siemens as shareholder of
the company will ensure to convene an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting prior to spin-off
completionandtoresolvetograntthefollowingauthorization.
1. the company is authorized to repurchase shares until the expiration of july 31, 2025, for
every permissible purpose, up to a limit of 10.0% of its share capital as of the time the
resolution takes effect or as of the date on which the authorization is exercised, if the latter
value is lower. the total number of shares repurchased under this authorization and any
other shares previously acquired and still held in treasury by the company or attributable to
the company pursuant to section 71d, section 71e of the german stock corporation act
(aktiengesetz)mayatnotimeexceed10.0%oftherespectivesharecapital.
2. any repurchase of shares shall be accomplished at the discretion of the executive board
either (1) by acquisition on the stock exchange, (2) through a public share repurchase offer
or (3) through a public offer to swap shares for shares in a listed company within the
meaning of section 3 paragraph 2 of the german stock corporation act (aktiengesetz).
offers under subsections (2) and (3) above can also be solicited by a request for submission
ofoffers.
a. if the shares are to be acquired on the stock exchange, the purchase price paid on the
stock exchange per share (excluding incidental transaction charges) may neither exceed
the stock market price of a share on the trading day, as determined during the opening

b. if the shares are to be acquired through a public share repurchase offer, the purchase

average closing price of a share in xetra trading (or a comparable successor system) on
the fourth, third and second trading day prior to the decision by the executive board
regarding the offer or acceptance of offers made by the shareholders, by more than

c. if the shares are to be acquired through a public offer to swap shares for shares in a
listed company within the meaning of section 3 paragraph 2 of the german stock
corporation act (aktiengesetz) (“exchange shares”), the exchange price paid by the
company (in the form of one or more exchange shares, any arithmetic fractions and any
cash component) per share (excluding incidental transaction charges) may neither
exceed the relevant value of a share by more than 10.0% nor fall below the relevant
value of a share by more than 20.0%. the basis for calculating this relevant value for

trading (or a comparable successor system) on the fourth, third and second trading day
prior to the decision by the executive board regarding the offer or acceptance of offers
made by the shareholders. if the exchange shares are not traded in xetra trading (or a
comparable successor system), the relevant value shall be the closing price on the stock
exchange where the exchange shares recorded their highest trading volume in the
precedingfullcalendaryear.
the executive board shall define the arrangements for acquiring the shares in moredetail. if
the number of shares tendered or offered by shareholders for purchaseorexchangeexceeds
the total volume which the company intends to repurchase, the shareholders’ tender right
may be excluded to the extent that the repurchase will be in proportion to the shares
tendered or offered by each shareholder. furthermore, the tender, acceptance or offer of

small quantities of up to 150 shares per shareholder may receive preferential treatment and
roundingaccordingtocommercialprinciplesmaybeprovidedfor.
if, after the publication of an offer, the market price differs from the price or from a price
range defined in connection with a request for submission of offers and these differences
may be material to the success of the offer, the price or the price range may be adjusted
during the submission period or up to acceptance. in this case the provision that the
purchase or exchange price may neither exceed the relevant value of a share by more than
10.0% nor fall below it by more than 20.0% refers to the respective closing price of the
share, and potentially the exchange share, on the last trading day prior to the ultimate
decisionoftheexecutiveboardontheadjustment.

authorization – in addition to selling them on the stock exchange or through an offer to all
shareholders proportionately according to their percentage of ownership – for every
permissiblepurpose,inparticularasfollows:
a. such shares may be cancelled without an additional resolution by the company’s
shareholders’ meeting being required for such cancellation or its implementation. such
cancellation leads to a capital decrease; in this case, the executive board is authorized to
reduce the share capital by the pro rata amount of the share capital attributable to the
cancelled shares and the supervisory board is authorized to adjust the number of shares
and the share capital in the articles of association accordingly. the cancellation can
upon decision by the executive board pursuant to section 237 paragraph 3 no. 3 of the
german stock corporation act (aktiengesetz) also be carried out without a capital
decreasebyadjustingtheprorataamountoftheothersharesofnoparvaluerelativeto

16.7 general provisions governing a liquidation of the company
apart from a liquidation as a result of insolvency proceedings, the company may be liquidated
only with a vote of 75.0% or more of the share capital represented at the general shareholders’
meeting at which such vote is taken. pursuant to the german stock corporation act
(aktiengesetz), in the event of the company’s liquidation, any assets remaining after all of the
company’s liabilities have been settled will be distributed pro rata among its shareholders. the
german stock corporation act (aktiengesetz) provides certain protections for creditors which
mustbeobservedintheeventofliquidation.
16.8 general provisions governing share capital increases and decreases
the german stock corporation act (aktiengesetz) provides that the share capital of a stock
corporation may be increased by a resolution of the general shareholders’ meeting. such
resolutionmustbeadoptedbyamajorityofatleast75.0%ofthesharecapitalrepresentedwhen
the resolution is passed unless the stock corporation’s articles of association provide for a
differentmajority.ourarticlesofassociationprovideinsection17para.2thattheresolutionsof
the general shareholders’ meeting are adopted by a simple majority of the votes cast unless
mandatory law or the articles of association require a higher majority or additional requirements
(which is currently not the case under the articles of association of the company). in addition,
shareholders may resolve to issue authorized capital by a vote of 75.0% of the share capital
represented at the passing of the resolution authorizing the executive board to issue shares, up
to a specific amount within a period not exceeding five years. the nominal amount of such
issuance may not exceed 50.0% of the share capital in existence at the time oftheauthorization,
thatis,atthetimetheauthorizedcapitalisenteredintothecommercialregister.
418
additionally, shareholders may resolve to create contingent capital for the purpose of issuing
shares (i) to holders of convertible bonds or other securities convertible into shares of the
company, (ii) as consideration in connection with a merger with another company or (iii) to
executives and employees. a resolution to create contingent capital must be adopted by at least
75.0% of the share capital represented at the passing of the resolution. the nominal amount of
the contingent capital created for the purpose of share issues to executives and employees may
not exceed 10.0%, a contingent capital created for any other purpose may not exceed 50.0% of
the nominal share capital in existence at the time such resolution is passed. the creation of
contingent capital beyond this threshold is permitted only for the purpose of enabling the
company to make an exchange in the event of its impending insolvency or for the purpose of
avertingoverindebtedness.
a resolution to reduce the share capital must be adopted by at least 75.0% of the share capital
representedatthepassingoftheresolution.
16.9 general provisions on subscription rights
according to the german stock corporation act (aktiengesetz), every shareholder is generally
entitled to subscription rights to any new shares issued within the framework of a capital
increase, including convertible bonds, bonds with warrants, profit-sharing rights or income
bonds. such subscription rights are freely transferable and may generally be traded on german
stockexchangeswithinaspecifiedperiodpriortotheexpirationofsuchperiod.
the general shareholders’ meeting may pass a resolution excluding subscription rights if at least
75.0% of the share capital represented adopts the resolution. to exclude subscription rights, the
executive board must also make a report available to the shareholders justifying the exclusion
and demonstrating that the company’s interest in excluding the subscription rights outweighs
theshareholders’interestinkeepingthem.theexclusionofsubscriptionrightsupontheissuance
of new shares is permitted, in particular, if the company increases the share capital against cash
contributions, the amount of the capital increase does not exceed 10.0% of the existing share
capital and the issue price of the new shares is not significantly lower than the stock exchange
priceofthecompany’sexistingshares.
16.10 exclusion of minority shareholders
under the rules of sections 327a et seq. of the german stock corporation act (aktiengesetz)
regarding the so-called “squeeze-out” of minority shareholders, the general meeting of a stock
corporation may resolve upon request by a shareholder who holds 95.0% of the share capital
(majority shareholder) that the shares held by the remaining minority shareholders be
transferred to the majority shareholder against payment of adequate cash compensation. the
amount of the cash compensation to be granted to the minority shareholders must reflect the
situation of the company at the time the resolution is adopted by the general meeting. for the
purpose of calculating the compensation amount, the full enterprise value is relevant and will
generally be determined by applying the discounted future earnings method
(ertragswertmethode). the minority shareholders are entitled to file for valuation proceedings
(spruchverfahren) in the course of which the appropriateness of the cash compensation is
reviewed.
under the german transformation act (umwandlungsgesetz), a majority shareholder holding at
least 90.0% of a stock corporation’s share capital can require the general shareholders’ meeting
toresolvethattheminority shareholdersmustselltheirstocktothemajority shareholderagainst
the payment of adequate compensation in cash, provided that (i) the majority shareholder is a
stock corporation, a partnership limited by shares (kgaa), or a european stock corporation (se)
havingits seatin germany,and(ii) thesqueeze-outisperformedtofacilitate amergerunderthe
german transformation act (umwandlungsgesetz) between the majority shareholder and the
stockcorporation.thegeneralshareholders’meetingapprovingthesqueeze-outmusttakeplace
within three months of the conclusion of the merger agreement. the procedure for the
squeeze-out is essentially identical to the squeeze-out under stock corporation law described
419
above, including the minority shareholders’ right to have the appropriateness of the cash
compensationreviewed.
furthermore, pursuant to the provisions in sections 39a and 39b of the german securities
acquisition and takeover act (wertpapiererwerbs- und übernahmegesetz) regarding the
so-called “takeover law squeeze-out”, a bidder who, following a takeover offer or a mandatory
tender offer, holds at least 95.0% of the voting share capital of the target company may, within
a period of three months following the expiration of the acceptance period, apply to the
regional court (landgericht) of frankfurt am main for a court order to transfer to such bidder
the remaining voting shares against payment of adequate compensation. no resolution of the
general meeting is required. the consideration granted under the takeover offer or the
mandatory tender offer is considered adequate compensation if the bidder, based on such offer,
has acquired at least 90.0% of the share capital subject to the offer. furthermore, following a
takeoveroffer oramandatorytenderoffer,theshareholdersofthetargetcompanywhodidnot
accept such offer may accept the offer within three months after the expiration of the
acceptance period (so-called “sell-out”), provided the bidder is entitled to file an application for
the transfer of the remaining voting shares in accordance with section 39a of the german
securities acquisition andtakeoveract(wertpapiererwerbs- undübernahmegesetz) (section 39c
of the german securities acquisition and takeover act (wertpapiererwerbs- und
übernahmegesetz)).
pursuant to the provisions of sections 319 et seq. of the german stock corporation act
(aktiengesetz) regarding the integration (eingliederung) of a subsidiary, the general meeting of
a stock corporation may resolve the integration into another company provided that the future
principal company (hauptgesellschaft) is a german stock corporation and holds at least 95.0% of
the shares of the company to be integrated. the shareholders of the integrated company are
entitled to adequatecompensation, which is generally tobegrantedin theform ofsharesofthe
principal company. the amount of compensation is to be determined by the so-called “merger
value ratio” (verschmelzungswertrelation) between the companies, i.e., the exchange ratio
whichwouldhavetobeconsideredadequateintheeventofamergerofthetwocompanies.
16.11 mandatory takeover bids
pursuant to the german securities acquisition and takeover act (wertpapiererwerbs- und
übernahmegesetz), every person whose share of voting rights reaches or exceeds 30.0% of the
voting shares of the company (after admission of the company’s shares to trading on the
regulated market of the frankfurt stockexchange)must, within sevencalendardays, publish this
fact, including the percentage of its voting rights, on the internet and through electronic media
for disseminating financial information. subsequently, and unless an exemption from this
obligation has been granted by bafin, such person must submit a mandatory public tender offer
to all shareholders of the company. the german securities acquisition and takeover act
(wertpapiererwerbs- und übernahmegesetz) contains several rules that provide for an
attribution and aggregation of voting rights in order to ensure that the shares are attributed to
the person actually controlling the voting rights attached thereto. if a person fails to give notice
of reaching or exceeding the 30.0% threshold or fails to submit a mandatory public tender offer,
shareholderrights (including votingrights and,in certain cases, theright tocollectdividendsand
liquidation proceeds) are suspended for the duration of non-compliance under certain
circumstances.inaddition,afinemaybeimposed.
16.12 disclosure requirements for holdings of shares and other instruments
after the company’s shares have been admitted to trading on the regulated market (regulierter
markt) of the frankfurt stock exchange, the company, as a listed company, and its shareholders
will become subject to the provisions of the german securities trading act
(wertpapierhandelsgesetz)governingdisclosurerequirementsforshareholdings.
section 33 of the german securities trading act (wertpapierhandelsgesetz) requires that anyone
who acquires, sells or whose shareholding in any other way reaches, exceeds or falls below 3.0%,
420
5.0%, 10.0%, 15.0%, 20.0%, 25.0%, 30.0%, 50.0% or 75.0% of the voting rights in an issuer
whose home country is germany and whose shares are admitted to trading on an organized
market must immediately, and no later than within four trading days of such occurrence, notify
the issuer and at the same time bafin. the notice period commences as soon as the person
obliged to notify (meldepflichtiger) knows, or, under the circumstances of the case should know,
that his or her voting rights reach, exceed or fall below the abovementioned thresholds, and no
later than two trading days after reaching, exceeding or falling below the threshold. only in the
case where the voting rights reach, exceed or fall below the thresholds as a result of an event
affecting all votingrights, thenthenotice periodmaycommenceatalatertime.thenotification
requirement is set off by the establishment of an obligation to transfer such ownership
immediately(ohnezeitlicheverzögerung).
notice must be givenusingastandardform annexedtothegermansecurities tradingreporting
regulation (wertpapierhandelsanzeigeverordnung). it must include the address of the individual
orentity,theshareofvotingrightsheldandthedateofreaching,exceedingorfallingbelowthe
respective threshold, and must be issued via a mandatory standard form. the company must
publish such notices immediately but no later than within three trading days after their receipt,
via media outlets or outlets where it can be assumed that the notice will be disseminated in the
eu (including, during the transitional period of the uk’s withdrawal from the eu, the united
kingdom) and the non-eu parties to the agreement on the eea (so-called “medienbündel”). the
company must also transmit the notice to bafin and to the german business register
(unternehmensregister)forstorage.
for purposes of the notification requirements, the german securities trading act
(wertpapierhandelsgesetz) contains various rules that require the attribution (zurechnung) of
voting rights of certain persons associated with the shareholder or acting together with the
shareholder. for example, shares held by a subsidiary (as defined in section 35 of the german
securities trading act (wertpapierhandelsgesetz)) are attributed to the parent company;
similarly, shares held by a third company for the account of another company are attributed to
the latter. furthermore, any kind of cooperation among shareholders that is intended to effect a
permanent and material change in the business strategy of the company can result in an
attributionofvotingrights.thismeansthatthecooperationdoesnotnecessarilyhavetoconcern
the exercise of voting rights specifically; coordination in individual cases, however, will not
triggertheattributionofvotingrights.
pursuant to section 38 of the german securities trading act (wertpapierhandelsgesetz), similar
obligations to notify the company and bafin for reaching, exceeding or falling below the
abovementioned thresholds (other than the 3.0% threshold) apply to direct and indirect holders
of certain instruments other than shares. this applies to instruments thatgrantuponmaturity an
unconditional right to acquire already issued voting shares of the company, a discretionary right
to acquire such shares, or instruments that refer to such shares and have a similar economic
effect to the aforementioned instruments. notifiable instruments include, inter alia, transferable
securities, options, futures contracts, swaps, forward rate agreements and contracts for
difference. the number of voting rights relevant for the notification requirement will generally
be calculated by reference to the full nominal amount of shares underlying the instrument
except where the instrument provides exclusively for a cash settlement. details for such
calculations are laid down in the commission delegated regulation (eu) 2015/761 of
december17,2014.

notifiable holdings pursuant to sections 33 and 38 of the german securities trading act
(wertpapierhandelsgesetz) must be aggregated, leading to a notification obligation for total
holdings above a 5.0% threshold pursuant to section 39 of the german securities trading act
(wertpapierhandelsgesetz).
421
furthermore, a person obliged to notify (meldepflichtiger) who reaches or exceeds the threshold
of 10.0% of the voting rights, or a higher threshold, is obligated to notify the issuer within 20
trading days regarding the objective being pursued through the acquisition of voting rights, as
well as regarding the source of the funds used for the purchase pursuant to section 43 of the
german securities trading act (wertpapierhandelsgesetz). changes in those objectives must also
be reported within 20 trading days. an issuer may stipulate in its articles of association that the
aforementioneddisclosurerequirementdoesnotapply.
in case that the disclosure requirements are not met, shareholder rights (including voting rights
and, in certain cases, the right to collect dividends and liquidation proceeds) are – subject to
certain exceptions – suspended for the duration of non-compliance. if the failure to comply with
the disclosure requirements specifically relates to the share of voting rights and is the result of a
willful or grossly negligent conduct, the suspension period is extended by six months after the
person obliged to notify (meldepflichtiger) files the required notification. in addition, a fine may
be imposed if a required notification is not at all, incorrectly or incompletely made, or not made
in the right manner or in a timely fashion. bafin also has the right to publish decisions on
sanctions and measures with regard to violations of the disclosure obligations and persons
responsibleforsuchviolations.
16.13 disclosure of transactions of persons discharging managerial
responsibilities
pursuant to article 19 of the market abuse regulation (regulation (eu) no.596/2014ofapril 16,
2014) (“market abuse regulation”), persons discharging managerial responsibilities
(“executives”) shall notify the company and bafin of every transaction conducted on their own
accountrelatingtosharesordebtinstrumentsofthecompanyortoderivativesorotherfinancial
instruments linked thereto (so-called “directors’ dealings”). the same applies to persons closely
associated with executives who must notify the company and bafin if they enter into such
transactions. transactions that must be notified also include, among others, pledging or lending
of financial instruments, transactions undertaken by any person professionally arranging or
executing transactions on behalf of an executive or a closely associated person, including where
discretion is exercised, as well as transactions made under a life insurance policy. the notification
requirement applies to any subsequent transaction once a total amount of € 20,000 has been
reached within a calendar year. notification shall be made promptly and no later than three

17 governing bodies and employees
17.1 overview
the company’s governing entities are its executive board, its supervisory board and the general
shareholders’ meeting (hauptversammlung). the responsibilities of these entities are determined
by the german stock corporation act (aktiengesetz), the articles of association, the internal
rules of procedure for the supervisory board (geschäftsordnung des aufsichtsrats) and the rules
ofprocedurefortheexecutiveboard(geschäftsordnungdesvorstands),whichwillberesolvedin
theconstitutingsessionofthesupervisoryboardfollowingspin-offcompletion.
the executive board is responsible for independently managing the company in accordance with
applicable law, the articles of association and internal rules of procedure for the executive
board. the executive board represents the company in dealings with third parties. the executive
board is responsible for implementing appropriate risk management and control systems within
the siemens energy group that provide timely warning of any development that might
jeopardize our continued existence. the executive board is obliged to report to the supervisory
board, in accordance with statutory regulations, regularly, timely and comprehensively on all
matters of planning, development of business, risks, risk management and compliance. the
executive board reports to the supervisory board regularly on the projected business objectives
and other key issues relating to corporate planning (especially finance, investment and human
resources planning). these regular reports include a budget for the following fiscal year, a plan
for the medium term and a discussion of any deviations between actual developments and
objectives previously reported on, including the reasons for such deviations. the executive board
is also obligated to report regularly to the supervisory board, at a minimum on a quarterly basis,
onthestatusofthebusinessandconditionofthecompanyanditssubsidiaries.
simultaneous membership on the executive board and supervisory board of the same german
stockcorporationisnotpermittedundergermanlaw.thesupervisoryboardmayappointcertain
of its members as deputies for absent or incapacitated members of the executive board for a
predetermined period of time which may not in any event exceed one year. the members of the
supervisory board may not exercise the functions of a member of the supervisory board during
theirtermofofficeasdeputymembersoftheexecutiveboard.
the supervisory board appoints the members of the executive board and is entitled to dismiss
them for good cause. the supervisory board advises and oversees the executive board on the
management of the company but is not itself authorized to manage the company. the articles
of association or the supervisory board must, however, designate certain types of transactions
thatmayonlybeundertakenwiththeapprovalofthesupervisoryboard.section9para.2ofthe
company’s articles of association provides that the rules of procedure for the company’s
executive board or supervisory board or resolutions of the supervisory board must make certain
transactions or types of transactions subject to the consent of the supervisory board. matters
subject to the consent of the supervisory board are expectedtoinclude, amongotherthings, the
acquisition, disposal and transformation of companies, shareholdings and parts of companies
above a certain threshold, the termination of the current area of business exceeding a certain
revenue share of total group revenues of the preceding fiscal year and the conclusion of
financingagreementsexceedingcertainthresholds.
members oftheexecutive boardandthesupervisory boardoweadutyofcare, adutyoflegality
and a duty of loyalty to the company. board members must consider a number of interests,
including those of the company and its shareholders, employees and creditors. the executive
board must also take into consideration shareholders’ rights to equal treatment and equal access
to information. should members of the executive board or supervisory board breach these
duties, they will be jointly and severally liable to the company for compensatory damages. the
directors’ and officers’ (d&o) liability insurance policy which the company intends to enter into
will provide financial loss coverage up to a certain amount for members of the executive board
andthesupervisoryboardwithregardtotheiractivities.thecompanywillbearthecostofthese
insurance policies. however, it should be noted that applicable german law requires that each
424
member of the company’s executive board remains personally responsible in the case of any
finding of personal liability of such member, as the case may be, for 10.0% of the total amount
of such personal liability, up to an amount that equals 150.0% of such member’s total annual
fixedremuneration.
under german law, a shareholder is generally not able to take legal action against members of
the executive board or supervisory board if he or she believes that these persons have neglected
their duties towards the company and this has resulted in damage to the company. company
claims for compensatory damages against members of the executive board or supervisory board
may, as a rule, only be asserted by the company itself, in which case the company is represented
by the executive board when claims are made against members ofthesupervisory boardandthe
supervisoryboardwhenclaimsaremadeagainstmembersoftheexecutiveboard.accordingtoa
ruling by the german federal court of justice (bundesgerichtshof), the supervisory board is
obligated to assert claims for compensatory damages against the executive board that are likely
to be successful unless important company interests would conflict with such an assertion of
claims and such grounds outweigh, or are at least comparable to, the grounds in favor of
asserting claims. in the event that the competent corporate body decides not to pursue such
claims, then such claims of the company for compensatory damages must nevertheless be
asserted against members of the executive board or supervisory board if the general
shareholders’ meeting passes a resolution to this effect by a simple majority vote. the general
shareholders’ meeting may appoint a special representative to assert such claims. shareholders
whose aggregate holdings amount to at least 10.0% or € 1,000,000 of the company’s share
capital may apply to the court to appoint a special representative to assert claims for
compensatory damages, who, in the event of such an appointment, becomes responsible for this
matter in place of the company’s management. in addition, if there are facts supporting the
claim that the company has been damaged by fraud or gross breaches of duty, shareholders
whose aggregate holdings amount to at least 1.0% or € 100,000 of the company’s share capital
have the option, under certain circumstances, of being granted permission by the competent
court to file a lawsuit on their own behalf for compensatory damages for the company against
members of the board. such a lawsuit will be dismissed if the company itself files a lawsuit for
compensatorydamages.
the company may only waive or settle any damage claims against members of the executive
board or supervisory board if three years have passed since the claims came into existence, and
only if a simple majority of the shareholders votes in favor of such waiver or settlement at the
shareholders’ general meeting and provided that a minority of the shareholders whose shares
collectively reach the level of 10.0% of the share capital does not raise an objection which is
enteredintheminutesofthemeeting.
under german law, it is illegal for shareholders or any other individuals to attempt to influence
members of the executive board or supervisory board, authorized representatives (prokuristen)
or other persons holding a commercial power of attorney to act in a way harmful to the
company. shareholders with a controlling influence may not use such influence to cause the
companytoactagainstitsownbestinterests,unlessanyresultingdamagesarecompensatedfor.
any person who uses his or her influence to cause a member of the company’s executive board
or supervisory board, authorized representative or person holding a commercial power of
attorney to act in a manner harmful to the company or its shareholders is obligated to
compensatethecompanyanditsshareholdersforanyresultingdamage.inaddition,membersof
the executive board and supervisory board may be jointly and severally liable for breach of their
duties.

by the supervisory board of siemens energy ag after the spin-off, the remuneration system for
executiveboardmembersshallbestructuredassetoutbelow:
17.2.3.1 remunerationsystem
the remuneration system for the executive board supports the achievement of siemens energy’s
strategicgoalsandsetsincentivesforsustainablevaluecreationwhilealsodiscouragingexcessive
risk-taking. the proposed target compensation structure for the executive board members
consists of non-performance and performance-based components: approximately 30.0% base
compensation, 30.0% short-term variable compensation (“bonus”) as well as 40.0% long-term
share-based compensation (“stock awards”). the remuneration system for the executive board
hasthefollowingcomponents:
17.2.3.1.1 non-performance-basedcomponents
the members of the executive board receive a fixed base salary in cash which is paid in twelve
equal installments. the annual base salary for dr.-ing. bruch is € 1,440,000, for each of
ms.ferraro,mr.holtanddr.-ing.eickholtitis€720,000.
additionally, non-monetary benefits and perquisites (“fringe benefits”) are granted, such as
provision of a company car, contributions towards the cost of insurance, reimbursement of fees
for tax advice, accommodation and moving expenses (including any taxes that have been
assumed in this regard), as well as costs connected with preventive medical examinations. the
430
value of such fringe benefits must not exceed a specific maximum as determined prior toagiven
fiscalyearbythesupervisoryboardinrelationtothebasesalary.
17.2.3.1.2 performance-basedcomponents
performance-based components include a short-term incentive (bonus) and a share-based long-
termincentive(stockawards):
short-term incentive (bonus). the bonus rewards the contribution made in the previous fiscal
year to achieving siemens energy’s strategic goals. this contribution is measured by three
equally-weighted components: return on capital employed, adjusted ebita margin and
individual targets of either financial or non-financial nature. the level of target achievement for
each of the three components can vary between 0.0% and 150.0%. for a 100.0% target
attainment (target amount), the amount of the bonus equals the amount of base compensation.
the bonus is paid out in cash. despite the attainment of the set targets, the supervisory board
can reduce the amount due under the bonus (down to zero) or seek to recover past
compensationalreadypaidoutincaseofseverebreachesofduty,severeviolationsofcompliance
rules and/or severe unethical behavior of a member of the executive board. the bonus is capped
atthemaximumpossibleleveloftargetachievement,i.e.,at150.0%.
share-based long-term incentive (stock awards). the stock awards reward a sustainable
development of siemens energy by measuring the achievement of financial and non-financial
targets over a four-year period. they are annual grants of forfeitable stock commitments made
to each executive board member at the beginning of a fiscal year. after a four-year vesting
period, beneficiaries receive one share in the company for each stock award or an equivalent
amount in cash. the preliminary number of stock awards to be fulfilled after the vesting period
depends on the company’s performance during the vesting period as measured in three
components: total shareholder return relative to the stoxx global 1800 industrial goods and
services (70.0%) and the mvis us-listed oil services 25 (30.0%), i.e., the change in price of a
siemens energy share during the vesting period plus all dividends distributed during this period,
compared with the shareholder return of the two indices (40.0%), siemens energy’s average
earnings per share compared with a pre-determined target (40.0%), and performance according
to targets based on esg factors (20.0%). the level of target achievement for each of the three
components can vary between 0.0% and 200.0%. overall target achievement is the weighted
averageofthetargetachievementlevelsofthethreecomponents.

grant amount are then granted to the beneficiary whereby the number of stock awards is
calculated by dividing the maximum grant amount by the share price on the grant date, less the
value of discounted dividends. beneficiaries are not entitled to dividends during the vesting
period. if the target achievement after the vesting period is less than 200.0%, the number of
stock awards initially granted will be reduced accordingly, and the number of shares
corresponding to the reduced number of stock awards will be transferred. the value of siemens
energy ag shares to be transferred after the end of the vesting period is further limited to a
maximum of 250.0% of the target amount. if this cap is exceeded, a corresponding number of
stockawardswillbeforfeitedwithoutrefundorreplacement.
the long-term incentive does not allow for the supervisory board to make discretionary
adjustments to target achievement or pay-out levels except in exceptional circumstances (e.g.,
severe economic crises). however, the supervisory board can reduce the amount due under the

17.2.3.1.3 pensionbenefitcommitments
the supervisory board decides annually whether to grant members of the executive board a
contribution to siemens energy’s pension plan. at its discretion, the supervisory board may
instead elect to grant members an amount in cash (“pension substitute”). if pension
contributions are made, these are credited to each executive board member’s personal pension
account. executive board members are eligible to receive benefits under the pension plan at the
ageof62.
17.2.3.1.4 maximumamountoftotalcompensation
in addition to the caps for fringe benefits, bonus and stock awards, a maximum amountoftotal
compensation is agreed annually. the target compensation comprises the base salary, maximum
fringe benefits, target amounts for the bonus and stock awards and pension contributions or
pension substitutes (if any). if compensation exceeds this maximum, the respective amount in
excess of the maximum is forfeited without refund or replacement. for the fiscal year 2021, the
maximum compensation amounts may be increased on a one-off basis by any spin-off incentive
(see“17.2.3.4spin-offincentiveinconnectionwiththespin-off”).
17.2.3.2 commitmentsinconnectionwithterminationofexecutiveboardmembership
theexecutiveboardcontractsdonotprovideanypossibilityforordinaryterminationwithnotice.
the mutual right to terminate the executive board contract without notice for cause remains in
effect. in the event of early termination of the appointment, the executive board contract is also
terminatedearlyunlessthesupervisoryboardadoptsprovisionstothecontrary.
in the event of early termination of the executive board contract bymutual agreement,effective
with the spin-off completion, the executive board contracts will stipulate a severance payment.
it is intended that the amount of this payment be limited in line with the recommendations of
thegermancorporategovernancecode(severancecap),i.e.,totwotimesannualcompensation,
butnotmorethanthevalueoftheremainingtermofthecontract.
no severance payments or special pension contributions will be made in case of an early
termination at the request of the executive board member or termination for cause by the
company.
there are to be no special provisions for members of the executive board in the event that a
change of control occurs, that is neither special rights to terminate the contract nor severance
payments.
17.2.3.3 d&oinsurance
the executive board and supervisory board members and certain employees of the siemens
group are currently covered by a group liability insurance policy with regard to their
management activities. this policy which is concluded for one-year terms at a time covers
personal liability for financial loss associated with performing the respective activity. the policy
provides for a deductible/retention that conforms to the requirements of the german stock
corporation act (aktiengesetz). siemens energy intends to provide a similar insurance coverage
underasiemensenergygroupliabilityinsurancepolicyuponthespin-offcompletion.
17.2.3.4 spin-offincentiveinconnectionwiththespin-off
prior to spin-off completion, the executive board members were granted a spin-off incentive,
i.e., a transaction bonus, by sem gmbh. accordingly, amounts ranging from 100% to 200% of a
targetamountindividually determinedforeachexecutiveboardmemberwillbepaidoutsubject
to the target being achieved. the target amount is € 1,500,000 for dr.-ing. christian bruch and
€ 750,000 each for dr.-ing. jochen eickholt, maria ferraro and tim oliver holt. the target
amountwill bepaidoutif two conditions aremet.thefirst conditionmustbemetasofspin-off
completion. it is fulfilled if the value of siemens energy for determining the financial result of
the spin-off as determined by an independent company valuation (the “market value”)
432
exceeds siemens energy’s book value as determined under ifrs by a certain threshold amount.
any amounts exceeding this threshold amount are subtracted from the market value to
determine, the “adjusted market value”. the second condition is met if the company’s stock
market value as determined on the basis of the average volume-weighted price of the shares
during the first 120 calendar days after listing reaches or exceeds the adjusted market value. if
these target values are not achieved, no spin-off incentive will be paid out. if the target values
are exceeded, a maximum of up to 200% of the target amount will be paid out. values between
100% and 200% are determined by linear interpolation. the executive board members are
obliged to reinvest the net profits from the spin-off incentive in shares of the company. it is
intended that the obligation to settle the spin-off incentive will be assumed by siemens energy
agafterspin-offcompletion.
17.2.3.5 treatmentofsiemensentitlementsafterthespin-offcompletion
siemensaganditsgroupcompanieshavegrantedorwill grantpriortothespin-off completion
under the share plans of siemens group various entitlements to shares of no par value
(registered shares) in siemens ag to members of the executive board and employees of siemens
ag as well as to members of corporate bodies and employees of siemens group companies,
including members of corporate bodies and employees of the siemens energy group (the
“beneficiaries”) in the context of share-based compensation programs and employee
participationprograms,respectively(togetherthe“stockentitlements”).
the stock entitlements of beneficiaries of the siemens energy group who leave the siemens
group as a direct consequence of the spin-off completion (because either their employing
company is no longer part of the siemens group or their contract provides for a termination as a
result of the spin-off) will be forfeited in accordance with the rules of the respective share plan.
however, these beneficiaries are entitled to cash compensation, upon the spin-off completion
for the stock entitlements from that entity of the siemens group or the siemens energy group
which is bound by the stock entitlement. as of august 26, 2020, we expect that the net cash
outflow for the cash compensation to be paid by siemens energy group will amount to
approximately€229million.
17.2.4 shareholdingsofexecutiveboardmembersandshareownershipobligation
the members of the executive board donot, apartfrom siemens agshares, directly orindirectly,
hold any shares or options on shares of the company as of the date of the prospectus. the
members of the executive board in total hold 27,546 shares in siemens ag for which 13,772
sharesinsiemensenergyagwillbeissueduponspin-offcompletion.
subject to formal approval of the executive board members’ compensation by the supervisory
board following spin-off completion, under the siemens energy share ownership guidelines,
the executive boardmembers shall beobligatedtocontinually holdsiemens energyagsharesof
an amount equal to a multiple of their base salary – 300.0% for the ceo and 200.0% for the
other members of the executive board – during their term of office. an initial approximately
four-year build-up phase beginning with the trading of the shares on the frankfurt stock
exchange allows executive board members to acquire the necessary shares over time. the
average base salary received by each member of the executive board over the four years prior to
the applicable verification date is relevant for this purpose. fulfillment of this obligation shall be
verified for the first time after the four-year build-up phase and annually thereafter. it is
intended that if share price fluctuations cause the value of the accumulated shareholding to fall
below the respective required amount, the executive board member will be obligated to
purchaseadditionalshares.
to compensate for the forfeiture of unvested equity awards at his previous employer, dr.-ing.
bruch received a one-time payment of approximately € 3.2 million upon joining siemens energy
in may 2020. dr.-ing. bruch is required to invest the after tax proceeds from this payment in
shareswithin30daysafterthelisting.

17.3 supervisory board
17.3.1 general
currently the supervisory board consists of three shareholder representatives. upon spin-off
completion, se global gmbh & co. kg will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company
and the company will therefore become subject to the german co-determination act
(mitbestimmungsgesetz).inaccordancewithsections95and96ofthegermanstockcorporation
act (aktiengesetz) and section 7 of the german co-determination act (mitbestimmungsgesetz),
the supervisory board will in future consist of twenty members (ten shareholder representatives
and ten employee representatives). the shareholder representatives are elected by the
shareholders at the general shareholders’ meeting. the new composition of the supervisory
board must be determined in a formal procedure, so-called “status proceedings”
(statusverfahren), that will be initiated by the executive board of siemens energy ag
immediatelyafterthespin-offcompletion.
theshareholders’meetingofsiemensenergyagonaugust20,2020hasamendedthearticlesof
association regarding the supervisory board so that the supervisory board consists of ten
members (“first amendment of the articles of association”). the first amendment of the
articles of association was registered with the commercial register on september 1, 2020.
furthermore, in anticipation of the spin-off completion, the shareholders’ meeting of siemens
energyagonaugust20,2020hasamendedthearticlesofassociationregardingthesupervisory
board so that the supervisory board will in the future consist of twenty members (ten
shareholder representatives and ten employee representatives) (“second amendment of the
articles of association”). the second amendment of the articles of association is subject to the
provision that it will be registered with the commercial register in such manner as to ensure that
it only becomes effective upon the spin-off completion and completion of the status
proceedings.thecurrentandfuturecompositionofthesupervisoryboardisasfollows:
(cid:129) thethreecurrentmembersofthesupervisoryboardwillresignuponthespin-offcompletion.
(cid:129) the general shareholders’ meeting has already elected ten new members of the supervisory
board. the election is conditional on the spin-off completion. the term of office of these
membersofthesupervisoryboardwillendupontheregistrationofthesecondamendmentof
the articles of association described above. however, under a corresponding condition
precedent, they have also been elected for another term of office beginning with the
registration of the second amendment of the articles of association until the end of the
general shareholders’ meeting that resolves on the discharge for the fiscal year ending
september30,2020(“agm2021”).
(cid:129) after completion of the status proceedings, the company plans to have employee
representatives be appointed by the competent court (the “court appointment”) until such a
time as regular employee representatives can be elected in accordance with the provisions of
thegermanco-determinationact(mitbestimmungsgesetz)(the“employeeelection”).
the supervisory board members that are shareholder representatives are elected by the
shareholders in the company’s general shareholders’ meeting. unless the general shareholders’
meeting has set a shorter term, the term of each supervisory board member, as well as the term
of each substitute member, expires at the end of the annual general shareholders’ meeting
ratifying the activities of the supervisory board for the fourth fiscal year following the
commencement of the member’s term of office, not including the fiscal year in which the term
commences. the election of a successor for a member leaving his or her office before the end of
hisorhertermofofficeisvalidfortheremainderofthetermofofficeofthedepartingmember.
re-electionispossible.
the articles of association provide that supervisory board members and substitute members of
the supervisory board may resign, without good cause on one month’s notice, by providing
written notice to the supervisory board chair. the shareholders’ meeting may appoint substitute
members for one or more supervisory board members, who, in accordance with the order
determined by election, may become members of the supervisory board if elected shareholder
434
representativesleaveofficebeforetheendoftheirtermoriftheelectionhasbeensetasidebya
court. the term of the substitute member expires as soon as a successor for the departing
supervisory board member is appointed but no later than the expiration of the departing
supervisoryboardmember’sterm.
at least one member of the supervisory board of a publicly traded company must have expertise
in the field of accounting or auditing. it must be ensured that at least one member of the
supervisoryboardhasthisrequiredfinancialexpertise.undermandatorystatutoryprovisionsand
the articles of association, the supervisory board is authorized to establish internal rules of
procedure (geschäftsordnung). the supervisory board’s will adopt internal rules of procedure
afterthespin-off.
following completion of the status proceedings described above and appointment of the
employee representatives to the supervisory board, the supervisory board will elect a new chair
and deputy chair from among its members. the election of the chair and first deputy chair will,
pursuant to section 27 of the german co-determination act (mitbestimmungsgesetz), in the
future require a two-thirds majority vote. if either the chair or first deputy chair is not electedby
a vote of two-thirds of the members of the supervisory board, the shareholder representatives
will elect the chair and the employee representatives will elect the first deputy chair by a simple
majority of the votes cast. the supervisory board may elect one or more other deputy chairs by
simple majority vote.thesupervisoryboardisauthorizedtomakeamendmentstothearticlesof
association that only affect their wording. meetings of the supervisory board are called by its
chair or, if he is unavailable, by a deputy chair, giving at least 14 days’ advance notice (not
including the day on which the invitation is sent and the day of the meeting itself). in urgent
cases the chair can shorten the notice period. the chair may call a meeting in writing, orally, by
phone,telefax,e-mailoranyothercommonmeansofcommunication.pursuanttothearticlesof
association that enter into force upon the spin-off completion and completion of the status
proceedings, at least half of the members of which the supervisory board is required to comprise
must participate in voting on a resolution to constitute a quorum. for calculating the quorum,
any member who is present but abstains from voting is deemed to have participated in the vote.
unless otherwise required by law or by the articles of association, resolutions of the supervisory
board are passed by a simple majority of the votes cast. for purposes of passing a resolution,
abstentions do not count as votes cast. if a vote of the supervisory board results in a tie, then
pursuant to the articles of association that enter into force upon the spin-off completion and
completion of the status proceedings, the chair’s vote counts twice if a second vote on the same
motion also results in a tie. the articles of association provide that if all members participate or
if adequate prior notice is given, then without a meeting and on the chair’s instruction
resolutions may be passed in writing, orally, by phone, telefax or e-mail or any other common
meansofcommunicationoranycombinationthereof.

during the last five years, no current member of the executive board or current or future
member of the supervisory board (see “17.3.2 current and future members of the supervisory
board”) has been convicted of any fraudulent offenses. in addition, in the last five years, no
official public incriminations and/or sanctions have been pending or imposed by statutory or
regulatory authorities (including professional associations) against a current member of the
executive board or current or future member of the supervisory board. with the exception of
mr. zwirn, who acted as non-executive director at sunedison, inc. whilst it reorganized under
chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code beginning in 2016, no current member of the executive
board or current or future member of the supervisory board, acting in the capacity of a member
of a management or supervisory entity or as senior manager, has been associated with any
bankruptcies and/or insolvencies, receiverships or liquidations. no current member of the
executive board or current or future member of the supervisory board has ever been deemed by
a court to be unfit for membership in amanagementorsupervisory entity ofacompanyortobe
unfit to exercise management duties for or manage the business of an issuer during the past five
448
years. at the date of this prospectus, no family relationships exist among the members of the
executive board, among the members of the supervisory board or among the members of the
executiveboardontheonehandandthemembersofthesupervisoryboardontheotherhand.
all current and six future members of the supervisory board are at the same time affiliated with
siemens ag,either becausetheyaremembers oftheexecutive boardorthesupervisoryboardof
siemens ag or employees of siemens, which after the spin-off completion will initially hold an
interest of 35.1% in siemens energy ag. the interests of siemens ag and siemens energy ag
may not always be aligned. this is a potential conflict of interest for the current members of the
supervisory board as well as for mr. joe kaeser, prof. dr. ralf p. thomas, mr. matthias e.
rebellius, dr. andrea fehrmann, mr. jürgen kerner and mr. hagen reimer in respect of their
duty as members of the supervisory board to act in the best interests of the company. however,
it should be noted that supervisory board members may not act in their own interests or in the
interests of persons or companies with whom they have a close relationship if those interests
conflict with those of the company or serves to attract business opportunities to such members
what would otherwise have gone to the company. apart from that, there are no conflicts of
interest or potential conflicts of interests between the duties of members of the executive board
and duties of members of the supervisory board vis-à-vis siemens energy ag and their private
interestsorotherobligations.
beyond the service agreements of the members of the executive board, there are no further
service or employment agreements between the company, its subsidiaries, and any of its
executive board members under which an executive board member would receive benefits from

17.5 corporategovernance
the german corporate governance code (deutscher corporate governance kodex) (the
“dcgk”), in its most recent version of december 16, 2019 and as published in the german
federalgazette(bundesanzeiger)onmarch20,2020,includesrecommendationsandsuggestions
for managing and supervising companies listed on german stock exchanges. it is based on
internationallyandnationallyrecognizedstandardsofgood,responsiblecorporatemanagement.
the dcgk contains recommendations (“shall provisions”) and suggestions (“should provisions”)
for corporate governance in relation to shareholders and the shareholders’ meeting, the
executive board and the supervisory board, transparency and accounting as well as auditing of
financial statements. while compliance with the recommendations or suggestions of the dcgk is
not mandatory, the german stock corporation act (aktiengesetz) requires the management and
supervisory boards of a listed company to disclose each year which recommendations were and
will be complied with and which recommendations were not or will not be applied and why
(so-called “declaration of conformity”). deviations from the suggestions contained in the dcgk
need not be disclosed. the declaration of conformity must be made publicly available on the
company’swebsiteatalltimes.
prior to the listing of the shares on the frankfurt stock exchange, the company is not subject to
the obligation to render a declaration as to compliance with the dcgk. as of the date of this
prospectus, the company – as a corporation whose shares are not yet listed – does not comply
withtherecommendationsofthedcgk.
the company will fully meet the obligation as a listed company to submit, publish and provide
shareholders with permanent access to disclosure in accordance with section 161 of the german
stock corporation act (aktiengesetz) during the course of the current fiscal year. the executive
board and supervisory board of siemens energy ag believe in the objectives of the dcgk to
foster a responsible and transparent corporate management and control directed towards
achievingasustainedincreaseinshareholdervalue.
the company intends to comply after the listing of the shares with all recommendations in the
dcgk,exceptforthefollowing:
(cid:129) item c.5: according to the dcgk’s recommendation, members of the management board of a
listed company shall not have, in aggregate, more than two supervisory board mandates in
449
non-group listed companies or comparable functions, and shall not accept the chairmanship of
a supervisory board in a non-group listed company. it is envisaged that our designated
chairman of the supervisory board will continue to be a member of the executive board of
siemens ag until february 2021. during this time period, the chair of the supervisory board
will (i) hold more than two supervisory board mandates and (ii) be a chairman of a supervisory
boardwhilstbeingamemberofthemanagementboardofanotherlistedcompany.
(cid:129) item c.10, sentence 1 of the dcgk and item d.4, sentence 1 of the dcgk: according to the
dcgk’s recommendation, the chair of the supervisory board and of the audit committee shall
be independent. the chair of the supervisory board and the chair of the supervisory board’s
audit committee may not fulfill, subject to final assessment by the supervisory board, the
requirementofindependenceastheyareassociatedwithourshareholdersiemensag.

17.6.1 gasandpoweremployees
during the nine-month period ended june 30, 2020 and the fiscal year 2019, our gas and power
segmenthadanaveragenumberofemployees(basedonheadcount)of66and65thousand.
in the fiscal year 2019, the average number of employees (based on headcount) per division was
20 thousand in transmission, 27 thousand in generation and 17 thousand in industrial
applications. the related total average number of employees (based on headcount) in service
amounted to 21 thousand. this comprises employees from the service businesses from the
divisionstransmission,generationandindustrialapplicationaswellasdigitalization.
our gas and power segment has in the past implemented several restructuring plans that led to
headcount reductions, see “9.4.10 integration and operational improvement measures; special
items”.
17.6.1.1 gasandpowerlaborrelations
some gas and power employees are organized in country-specific union organizations. in
germany, gas and power employees are organized in the german metalworker’s union
(industriegewerkschaft metall). we are a member of various regional employers’ associations.
membersoftheseorganizationsaresubjecttotherespectivecollectivebargainingagreements.
in certain cases, our employees are represented by employee representatives on the boards of
our group companies. in particular, following the spin-off, 50% of the members of the
supervisoryboardwillbeemployeerepresentatives.
our german gas and power employees are also represented by works councils. pursuant to the
german works constitution act (betriebsverfassungsgesetz), works councils have numerous
rights relating to the notification and co-determination in personnel, social and economic
matters. forinstance,workscouncilsarerequiredtobenotifiedinadvanceofanydismissalofan
employee, must confirm hiring and relocations of employees. co-determination rights in social
mattersareforexamplerelatedtotheestablishmentofworkschedulesandrulesofconduct.
our german gas and power senior managers are represented by the company spokespersons’
councils (sprecherausschüsse für leitende angestellte). they have numerous notification and
consultationrightsregardingpersonnelandeconomicmatters.
if a european works council is established after the spin-off, our employees in member states of
the european union and other contracting states to the agreement on the european economic
area are represented by it. the european works council has information and consultation rights
regardingcross-bordermatterswithimpactonemployees.
good relationships with our employees are especially important to us and we believe that our
employeerelationsarepositive.
17.6.1.2 gasandpoweremployeestockparticipationplans
until spin-off completion, many of our gas and power employees have been or will be granted
entitlements to siemens shares under various siemens employee programs. following spin-off
completion, our employees are no longer eligible to participate in siemens employee programs.
any outstanding entitlements under these programs will then be compensated in cash (see
“17.2.3.5treatmentofsiemensentitlementsafterthespin-offcompletion”).
siemens energy intends to implement employee share programs (to be settled in shares or in
cash) for thegasandpoweremployeesincertainjurisdictions duringthecourseofthefiscal year
ending september 30, 2021. those share programs are intended to give employees (including
managers)theopportunitytoparticipatesustainablyinthegroup’ssuccess.accordingly,siemens
energy plans to implement a matching program (see “17.6.1.2.1 matching program”), stock
awards (see “17.6.1.2.2 stock awards”) and a jubilee share program (see “17.6.1.2.3 jubilee share
program”).additionally,managersandemployeesmayparticipateinone-timespin-offincentive
programs(see“17.6.1.2.4employeespin-offincentive”).
451
17.6.1.2.1 matchingprogram
under the matching program, eligible employees (including managers but excluding members of
the executive board) of siemens energy can invest up to five percent of their annual (gross) total
target cash compensation in shares of the company. for each three shares so acquired (the
“investment shares”), the employee receives one matching share in the company (“matching
share”)or,inexceptionalcases,anequivalentpaymentincash.asageneralrule,theinvestment
shares and matching shares will be subject to a mandatory blocking period of one year.
employees of a group company located in germany may take advantage of tax benefits
applicable to employee share investments of up to € 360 per annum. in these cases, participants
may choose to invest € 100 or € 260. when investing € 100, participants receive two matching
shares per investment share that is acquired using that investment amount; for a further
investment amount of € 160, they receive one matching share per share that is acquired using
thefurtherinvestmentamount.sharessoacquiredwillnotbesubjecttoablockingperiod.these
investment amounts will count against the five percent threshold of the annual (gross) total
target cash amount mentioned above. for investment amounts exceeding € 260, the general
rulesdetailedaboveapply.
17.6.1.2.2 stockawards
employees holding upper management level positions will receive forfeitable performance-
oriented stock commitments. the terms and conditions of these commitments are largely
identical with the stock awards granted to members of the executive board (see
“17.2.3.1.2 performance-based components”). other employees of senior management and
further selected employees may receive non-performance-oriented stock awards. these stock
awards follow a ratable vesting scheme, i.e., each year the employee receives a number of shares
in the company corresponding to 25% of the initially granted number of stock awards or, in
exceptional cases, an equivalent payment in cash. additionally, stock awards following the
described ratable vesting scheme can be granted to employees to honor outstanding
performance.
17.6.1.2.3 jubileeshareprogram
a jubilee share program is intended to be implemented for employees in germany which
provides that eligible employees will receive jubilee shares for their 10th, 25th, 40th and 50th
serviceanniversary.
17.6.1.2.4 employeespin-offincentiveandsharebuybackprograms
(1) buildingsiemensenergyincentiveprogram
under the building siemens energy incentive program a low triple digit number of key
employees who contributed essentially to the preparation of the spin-off were granted a
one-time spin-off incentive. the initial value of the incentive consists of a percentage of the
beneficiary’s base salary at the grant date (“bsei target amount”). it consists of two elements: a
short-term cash component that corresponds to 25% of the bsei target amount and will be paid
following spin-off completion and a long-term equity component which corresponds to 75% of
the bsei target amount and is composed of forfeitable stock awards (“bsei stock awards”). the
number of bsei stock awards will be determined by dividing 75% of the bsei target amount by
the volume-weighted average price (“vwap”) of the shares during the first 120 trading days of
after the listing. each bsei stock award entitles the holder to one share in the company or, in
exceptional cases, an equivalent payment in cash. the bsei stock awards will be settled after a
vesting period of three years starting with spin-off completion. thesettlement ofthebseistock

in certain jurisdictions, similar employee spin-off incentive programs will be set up that provide
for stock awards on substantially the same terms, but without a short-term cash component (the
“all employee program”). the individual target amount is defined as 3% of the annual (gross)
total target cash compensation of each participant as of september 1, 2020 (“all employee
program target amount”). the number of shares transferred to each participant is subject tothe

the maximum number of shares will be settled if the price of the shares has at least doubled
whereas a value cap of 6.0 times the all employee program target amount applies. the

additionally, employees of the participating german group companies may also participate in a
separate share program (“2020 special payment”). the program allows these employees to
benefit from certain tax rules recently introduced by the german legislator with a view to
mitigating covid-19-related detriments. participants of the 2020 special payment will receive
shares representing a value of 2.6% of their total target cash compensation as of september 1,

(3) sharebuybackprogram
siemens energy ag will implement a program to repurchase its own shares immediately after
occurrence of the listing. the repurchase program is expected to run from september 28, 2020
until march 31, 2021 at the latest. during this period, shares shall be repurchased for up to
€ 393 million, but not more than 72,664,519 shares. the repurchase program will serve to
distribute shares to members of the executive board and employees of the siemens energy
group (see, for example, “17.2.3.1.2 performance-based components” and “17.6.1.2.4 employee
spin-off incentive”). the repurchase of shares can be stopped, interrupted and continued at any
time in accordance with applicable legal requirements. the purchase price per share paid on the
stock exchange (excluding ancillary acquisition costs) may not be more than 10% higher or 20%
lower than the price of a share determined on the relevant trading day by the opening auction
in xetra trading (or in a comparable successor system). depending on prevailing trading volumes
and subject to applicable trading conditions, siemens energy ag intends to repurchase a

2,000ofsenvion’sformeremployees.
17.6.2.2 sgrelaborrelations
labor relations between sgre and its employees are regulated by the legal regulations of each
country and such agreements and arrangements as may have been reached with employees’
representatives. at international level and due to its european footprint, sgre is currently still
part of the siemens ag european works council, where it is playing an active role in providing
employees with information and consultation rights. within that framework it has agreed with
its employees’ representatives toestablishaspecific workinggroupaimedatestablishingacloser
and more flexible space for social dialogue. sgre has a working group for the communication
and discussion of labor-related topics affecting more than one european country; this working
group will continue to be in existence within sgre after the separation from siemens, but
independentlyfromthesiemensageuropeanworkscouncil.
sincenovember2019,arenewedandupgradedglobalframeworkagreementbetweensgre,its
labor representatives and industriall global union (the “gfa”) is in place. industriall is the
global trade union with headquarters in geneva, switzerland, that encompasses gamesa’s (and
now sgre’s) industrial activity. sgre believes that the new gfa is still the only global agreement
of its kind to guarantee labor rights by a company in the renewable energy sector. the gfa
agreementapplies toall companies inthesgregroup(includinganypotentialnewgroupentity
resulting after a merger, acquisition or restructuring) and to all its employees worldwide during
the fulfillment of their functions and in their work, commercial and professional relationships. it
contains provisions that strengthen the rights of workers and trade unions, strengthens social,
laborandenvironmentalrightsalreadycontainedinsgre’sbusinessconductguidelinesissuedin
2018 (including the employees’ rights to freedom of association, union membership and
collective bargaining), makes health and safety at work, working conditions and equal
opportunities key issues for company action, and guarantees implementation and promotes the
conditions for a social dialogue at the international level. the gfa will be valid for four years
from the date of signature. at the request of either party, negotiations torevise thegfamaybe
agreed. during the year preceding the end of the gfa’s term, and no later than six months prior
to such date, the management of sgre, the industriall global union and the representative
unionorganizationswillmeettoexaminewhetherthegfashallberenewedornot.
sgre is a member of the un global compact, so that its ten principles and the global industrial
union framework agreement are binding for sgre. this means that all of sgre’s employees are
activelycoveredbyalegallybindingandfreelynegotiatedcollectiveagreement.
at a national level, the situation varies due to the large number of countries and practical
differences among them. roughly half of sgre’s employees were covered by collective
bargainingagreementsatalocallevelasoftheendofthefiscalyear2019.
17.6.2.3 sgreincentiveandbenefitplans
in addition to the fix remuneration, sgre has defined a globally applicable short-term incentive
program for about 30% of its total staff. the target structure for this program is composed of
70%overallsgreperformanceindicatorsand30%individualtargets.
sgre has a long-term incentive plan (the “long-term incentive plan” or the “plan”) in place,
originally approved by sgre’s general shareholders’ meeting on march 23, 2018, which
contemplates the delivery of shares of the sgre s.a. linked to the achievement of certain
strategic objectives after measurement periods of three years. this long-term incentive plan is
addressed to a maximum of 300 beneficiaries, including the chief executive officer, senior
executives, certain directors and employees of sgre s.a. and, where appropriate, of subsidiaries
of the sgre group. the plan has a total duration of five years divided into three independent
cycles with a measurement period of three years for each cycle (i.e., 2018-2020, 2019-2021 and
2020-2022). the settlement period of the plan will fall during the fiscal years 2021 for the first
454
cycle, 2022 for the second cycle and 2023 for the third cycle. the shares will be delivered within
sixty calendar days from the date on which sgre s.a.’s board of directors prepares the financial
statements for the relevant period, in order to determine the degree of achievement of the
objectives for each cycle (“delivery date”). the plan will end on the delivery date for the cycle
relating to the first cycle (i.e., following the preparation of the financial statements for the fiscal
yearendingseptember30,2022).thedesignationofanindividualasabeneficiaryofaplancycle

first cycle is 174, for the second cycle 191 and 183 for the third cycle. the plan (as amended) may
not exceed, in total, the delivery of 7,560,000 shares. sgre s.a. will allocate treasury shares to
cover the plan or otherwise meet the commitments derived from the plan with a financial
instrumentthatprovidesadequatecoverage.
furthermore, certain sgre employees that have transferred from other siemens group entities
participate in share-based payment awards implemented by siemens. in such cases, siemens
delivers the respective shares on behalf of sgre. due to the limited extent of participation in
these share-based programs, the effect on sgre’s consolidated financial statements for the past
three fiscal years is not significant. any outstanding entitlements under these programs will be
settled in cash after the spin-off completion (see “17.2.3.5 treatment of siemens entitlements
afterthespin-offcompletion”).
moreover,sgreoffersbenefitswhichdifferonalocalbasisandaredependentoneachcountry’s
regulations and general market practices. such benefits may include post-employment benefits
(pensionplans),health,lifeanddisabilityinsuranceandothers.
sgre provides post-employment defined benefit plans to almost all of its employees in germany.
outside germany, predominantly service gratuities and severance indemnities pursuant to legal
requirements or arrangements applicable to the industry are provided by a limited number of
sgre entities in different jurisdictions. sgre’s major plans are funded with assets in specific
entities. in accordance with local laws and bilateral agreements with benefit trusts (trust
agreements),thoseplansaremanagedintheinterestofthebeneficiaries.sgre’sdefinedbenefit
plans cover about 6,000 participants for the fiscal year 2019 (2,800 and 3,000 participants for the
fiscalyears2018and2017,respectively),whichalmostonlycomprisesactiveemployees.
in germany, sgre provides pension benefits through the plan sgre “beitragsorientierte siemens
altersversorgung” (hereinafter, “sgre bsav”), frozen legacy plans and deferred compensation
plans. the majority of sgre’s active employees in germany participate in the sgre bsav. those
benefits are predominantly based on contributions made by sgre and returns earned on such
contributions, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by sgre. the frozen plans expose the
employer to investment risk, interest rate risk and longevity risk. the effects of compensation
increases are substantially eliminated. the pension plans are funded via contractual trust
arrangements. nolegal orregulatory minimum fundingrequirements apply. sgreexpectstopay
employer contributions to the german defined benefit plans in the fiscal year 2020 in the
amount of approximately € 4 million. the pension obligations of sgre vis-à-vis the sgre bsav
participantsshallremainunaffectedbythespin-off.
sgre also intends to implement two different share plans: an employee share plan and a share-
based recognition program. under the employee share plan, an investment will be rewarded
with freesgres.a.shares(foreverythreesharesacquired,onefreesharewill begrantedaftera
two-year holding period). the employee share plan is currently expected to be implemented by
sgre in november 2020 in selected countries, with no specific limitation on the number of
participants. the annual cost to sgre relating to sgre’s investment for the employee share plan
may not exceed € 4 million in the aggregate (reflecting a maximum employee investment
totaling € 12 million). the share-based recognition program aims at rewarding outstanding
performancebygrantingbeneficiariesrecognitionstockawardswhichwillbeconvertedintofree
sgre s.a. shares after two years. according to the current plan, the share-based recognition
program could be implemented in september 2020 (with the recognition stock awards under the
455
plan being granted in october 2020). it is currently envisaged that sgre s.a. will nominate an
estimated number of 100 employees for the share-based recognition plan, and the selection
criteria is expected to be based on sgre’s corporate values. the number of recognition stock
awards to be granted to each beneficiary is expected to range from a minimum of 5% to a
maximum of 35% of the annual base salary. according to the current plan, the share-based
recognition program will have a duration of two years from the moment of granting the
recognition stock awards until the moment when they will be converted into sgre s.a. shares.

18 certain relationships and related-party
transactions
in accordance with ias 24 “related party disclosures”, transactions with persons or companies
which are, inter alia, members of the same group as a company or which are in control of, or
controlled by a company must be disclosed unless they are already included as consolidated
companies in a company’s financial statements. control exists if a shareholder owns more than
one half of the voting rights in a company or, by virtue of an agreement, has the power to
control the financial and operating policies of a company’s management. the disclosure
requirements under ias 24 also extend to transactions with associated companies (including joint
ventures) as well as transactions with persons who have significant influence on a company’s
financial and operating policies, including close family members and intermediate entities. this

the carve-out. pursuant to the master separation agreement, siemens ag and se global
gmbh & co. kg are each jointly and severally liable for the obligations of their respective

agreement which was approved by the shareholders’ meetings of siemens energy ag and
siemens agonmay22,2020andjuly9,2020,respectively. thespin-off andtransferagreement
is yet to be registered with the commercial registers of siemens ag and siemens energy ag in
order to become effective (i.e., the spin-off completion) which is expected to occur on
september 25, 2020. the agreement contains, among other things, the mandatory provisions
pursuant to the german transformation act (umwandlungsgesetz). this includes provisions on
the assets to be spun off as well as details of the transfer and consideration to be granted in
return, including the allotment ratio of 2:1, i.e., two siemens ag shares entitle to one siemens
energy ag share. further, the spin-off and transfer agreement describes special rights, benefits
and consequences of the spin-off for employees and their representative bodies. the spin-off
and transfer agreement further provides that joe kaeser shall act as chair of the supervisory
board, while prof. dr. ralf p. thomas is expected to head the audit committee. it contains a
number of annexes, such as: (i) the contribution agreement to create the siemens energy ag
shares remaining with siemens (see “5.2.3 the capital increases against contribution in kind”),
(ii) the rules applicable under stock entitlements, (iii) the group separation agreement (as
defined below), (iv) the deconsolidation agreement (as defined below) and (v) the articles of
associationofsiemensenergyagandcapital-relatedauthorizations.
(3) groupseparationagreement(konzerntrennungsvertrag)
on may 22, 2020, siemens ag and siemens energy ag entered into a group separation
agreement (konzerntrennungsvertrag) (the “group separation agreement”) which governs the

(cid:129) siemens energy ag is obligated to provide any information required by siemens ag to satisfy
the requirements under ifrs with regard to its shareholding in siemens energy ag. this also
applies outside of the regular reporting of siemens energy ag to siemens ag, in particular for
the purpose of timely responses to questions of the german financial reporting enforcement
panel (deutsche prüfstelle für rechnungslegung). siemens energy ag must also provide
information with regardtoexpectedearningspersharewhich siemens agrequires for its own
financial reporting. siemens ag shall reimburse siemens energy ag for any external costs
incurred by preparing the information. furthermore, siemens ag has undertaken to only
publish information that directly, indirectly or by inference refers to the results of siemens
energy ag after siemens energy ag has published those results or with consent of siemens
energy ag. siemens ag is obligated to provide information required by siemens energy ag
with regard to siemens ag’s role as shareholder, in particular information on related party-
transactions.
(cid:129) siemens energy ag shall procure that certain assets contributed to se global gmbh & co. kg
are recognized at their tax book values and that the required application with the competent
tax office is filed in time. if siemens energy ag violates these obligations and taxes are
imposed on siemens ag or sbi gmbh, both of which hold shares in the company, or their loss
carry forwards for corporate income and trade tax purposes are reduced, siemens energy ag
shall compensate siemens ag or sbi gmbh. sbi gmbh has also contributed a limited
partnership interest (kommanditanteil) in se global gmbh & co. kg to siemens energy ag in
return for being granted shares in siemens energy ag. in this regard, siemens energy ag is
obligated to recognize this partnership interest at tax book value and file the required
application with the competent tax office in time. if these obligations are violated, siemens
energy ag is liable to siemens ag or sbi gmbh for taxes imposed on them or their loss carry
forwards for corporate income tax purposes are reduced. the group separation agreement
further contains provisions in relation to shares held by siemens ag or sbi gmbh that are
subjecttoalock-upperiod(sperrfristbehafteteanteile)fortaxpurposesinconnectionwiththe
separation of the siemens energy business. if a contribution gain (einbringungsgewinn) is
assessed, the tax consequences at the level of siemens ag and sbi gmbh together with the
trade tax arising at the level of se global gmbh & co. kg may result in a total cash-out of up
to a medium three digit million euro amount. such tax cash-out may be compensated only
partially by corresponding tax benefits, for which the cash effect may only arise over time. in
case siemens energy ag caused such assessment of the contribution gain (e.g., by violating the
obligation to procure that siemens energy entities apply for tax book values or by triggering
an event pursuant to section 22 (1) sentence 6 of the german transformation tax act
(umwandlungssteuergesetz)), siemens energy ag shall compensate siemens ag or sbi gmbh
for the resulting tax consequences. in case such contribution gain is caused by siemens ag or
sbi gmbh, siemens energy ag may have a compensation claim against siemens ag for trade
tax or the reduction of trade tax loss carry-forwards resulting therefrom, whereas such claim is
generally reduced by potential tax benefits arising for siemens energy ag and/or se global
gmbh & co. kg in case of a recognition of an increase amount in accordance with
section 23 (2) of the german transformation tax act (umwandlungssteuergesetz) (“step-up”).
totheextentthatthepotentialstep-upbenefitexceedstheamount,whichsiemensagwould
have to pay to siemens energy ag without the deduction of the step-up benefit, siemens
energy ag is obliged to pay to siemens ag an amount equal to this difference, even though

the step-up benefit may not have materialized in a cash effect yet but would only materialize
over time. finally, the parties of the group separation agreement (konzerntrennungsvertrag)
shall cooperate with regard to tax matters and in case one party does not comply with its
cooperation obligations, it shall indemnify the other party, i.e., if siemens energy ag is not

(cid:129) furthermore, the group separation agreement specifies a mechanism for dispute resolution
and certain confidentiality standards regarding the group separation agreement and its
performance, including the sharing of information pursuant to the group separation
agreement.
(4) deconsolidationagreement(entherrschungsvertrag)
on may 22, 2020, siemens ag and its subsidiary sbi gmbh entered into a deconsolidation
agreement (entherrschungsvertrag) with siemens energy ag (the “deconsolidation
agreement”). under the deconsolidation agreement siemens ag and sbi gmbh have
undertaken vis-à-vis the company to restrict the exercise of their voting rights, including voting
rights held by other siemens group companies at any time, in the company to a level ensuring
that siemens is not able or deemed to be able to exercise any controlling influence on the
company and/or siemens energy group companies after the spin-off completion. the
deconsolidationagreementprovidesthreemainelementsforthispurpose:
(cid:129) siemens ag and sbi undertake that they shall restrict the exercise of voting rights from shares
held by them in any shareholders’ meeting of the company on the resolution of certain
agenda items to an extent that shall ensure that such votes (together with votes from shares
held by affiliated companies and certain other related parties such as siemens pension-trust
e.v.) can no longer carry a vote on its own. this applies to resolutions of the shareholders’
meeting of the company on the (i) appointment and removal of members of the supervisory
board,(ii)certainmanagementmeasuresthatarebroughtbeforetheshareholders’meetingof

financial statements (jahresabschlüsse), if exceptionally the shareholders’ meeting resolves on
suchapproval.
(cid:129) siemens undertakes to ensure that no more than three shareholder representatives who are
dependent on siemens ag are members of the supervisory board at the same time. the
deconsolidation agreement contains undertakings of siemens to achieve this goal as well as
criteria for the assessment of dependence. for purposes of the deconsolidation agreement,

(5) agreements with regard to siemens energy’s gas and power business in algeria, greece,
indonesiaandpakistan
mainly due to complex carve-out situations, local law restrictions or timing reasons, in particular
in algeria, greece, indonesia and pakistan, siemens retained the gas and power business (for
india, see “18.1.1.1.1(6) agreements related to the conduct of siemens energy’s gas and power
businessinindia”),whichiscarriedoutbylocalsiemensgroupcompanies(eacha“localsiemens

(7) contributions(agreements,amendment(s))/latas
in all other countries in which the respective local siemens energy business was not conducted in
a separate legal entity, the relevant local siemens energy business was separated from the other
siemensbusinessingeneralasofmarch31,2020(localcarve-outs).theseparationswerelargely
implemented by formation of new local legal entities to which the local siemens energy business
was transferred either through corporate or transformation law measures under local law (e.g.,
through spin-offs) or based on purchase agreements (carve-outs). certain carve-outs may be
accompaniedbyadditionalfollow-up measures,suchastheregistrationofbranches,tomakethe
respective local businesses fully operational. in a classic carve-out, generally siemens would be
held liable for obligations or otherwise affected by consequences arising from former activities
that are attributable to siemens energy. it has therefore been agreed in each case that the
respectivelocalsiemensenergycompanywillindemnifysiemensfromanysuchliability.
in other countries, siemens’ businesses pertaining to siemens energy’s gas and power business
were separated by means of a so-called “reverse carve-out” (shares in companies in relation to
siemens’ local business were transferred to siemens energy, with the local siemens business
being carved-out into a siemens group company) and transferred under latas. these latas
were entered into between the respective local transferring company of the siemens group, as
transferor of the assets, and the respective local acquiring company of the siemens group for
each country as transferee (see “5.2.2 rest of world carve-out”). the transfers were carried out
in the form of sales, contributions in kind, demergers or similar methods or contractual
relationshipsunderlocallawofthecountriesinwhichthetransferredbusinessesarelocated.the
shares in the local siemens energy group companies, which, following the execution of the
latas, basically only hold the respective local siemens energy business, were transferred to
siemens gas and power holding b.v. by selling the shares in the local siemens energy group
company on the basis of purchase agreements (local share transfer agreements, “lstas”). in
some cases, the respective local siemens energy group company was already formed and funded
for the acquisition of the respective local siemens energy business. in other cases, certain local
siemens energy businesses, especially the local siemens energy business in the united states,
were not separated by way of a local carve-out; instead the shares in the already existing local
siemens energy group companies were contributed into or transferred to se global gmbh & co.
kg or siemens gas and power holding b.v., and, in some of these cases, minor business activities
notrelatedtothesiemensenergybusinesswereagreedtobewounddown.
depending on the relevant jurisdiction, the business transferred pursuant to the latas included
the transfer (or assumption of) tangible assets, ip, contracts, liabilities, real estate, leases or real
estate-related services, employee relationships and related liabilities, litigations, permits and all
other relevant assets. the consideration for the transfers was in most cases based on a valuation
ofanindependentauditororoninternalvaluations.
as a consequence, in reverse carve-out situations, siemens energy may be held liable for
obligations, or may be affected by other consequences from earlier activities that are
attributabletothelocalremainingsiemensbusinessandthus,thelatasspecifythatthesiemens
group shall indemnify siemens energy against any liabilities arising out of or in connection with
the transferred businesses, with the exception of tax liabilities pertaining to periods until
carve-out effective date, that must generally be borne by the company upon which they are
imposed. these rules apply in reverse to classic carve-outs, i.e., siemens energy is then obligated
to indemnify siemens with the aforementioned exception for tax liabilities. the latas also
expressly regulate the allocation of potential liabilities relating to litigation cases pending as of
the effective date of the relevant lata that were attributable to the transferred business. with
respect to pending litigation, the general principle of the latas is that each party shall be put
into the economic position it would assume if the pending litigation had been transferred. in
certain countries, such as brazil, where a reverse carve-out took place, this principle also applies
under the relevant latas with respect to litigation arising in connection with the businesses
carvedoutintoasiemensgroupcompany(see“12.8legalandadministrativeproceedings”).

a separate local asset transfer agreement in relation to the so-called “t3000 business” (business
of development and maintenance of power plant control systems) has been concluded between
siemens ag and se global gmbh & co kg on march 31, 2020, which becomes effective on
august 1, 2020. under this agreement, certain tangible assets, contracts, including all receivables
and liabilities, employees and ip rights owned by siemens ag relating to t3000 business have
been transferred to se global gmbh & co kg. siemens ag received certain back-licenses in
relation to the transferred ip rights and improvements and modifications of inventions
underlying the ip rights made by siemens energy that allow siemens ag to continue
development of t3000 technology and its use in its own solutions. however, it does not allow
siemens ag to provide maintenance of certain power plants using the t3000 technology in
unmodified form or to use or market t3000 solution in unmodified form. in addition the same
parties have entered into a related long term services agreement. further related agreements,
e.g., a supply agreement and a cooperation agreement, will have been concluded or should be
concluded until the end of september 2020. these agreements predominantly govern the supply
of certain t3000 related products by siemens ag to siemens energy as well as certain forms of
supportbysiemensenergytosiemensaginrelationtohardwareandsoftwareproducts.

for risks relating to erroneous transfers of assets or liabilities or failures to transfer assets or
liabilities, see “3.5.7 we are exposed to risks arising from indemnities which we have granted to
siemens in connection with our separation from siemens. in addition, as part of this separation,
assets or liabilities may have been incorrectly allocated, which may require us to transfer certain

(8) germancontributionagreement
on december 20, 2019, siemens ag and se global gmbh & co. kg concluded a contribution
agreement agreeing the details of the germany carve-out (the “german contribution

(cid:129) the following ip rights that were owned by siemens ag were transferred by it to se global
gmbh & co. kg: (i) patents for which the gas and power business had incurred the majority of
costs, (ii) trademarks exclusively used by the gas and power business and funded by the gas

(iii) know-how and software in object code format predominantly used and software in source
code format predominantly financed by the gas and power business, (iv) domains
predominantly used by the gas and power business and (v) copyrights in relation to the
transferred tangible assets, patents, know-how, software and domains. in relation to the
transferred patents, know-how, software and copyrights, se global gmbh & co. kg granted
non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid-up use rights to siemens ag to
conduct any activities in the defined current business field of siemens ag and its affiliates.
under certain circumstances, the license is transferrable and sub-licensable. in relation to
patents, know-how, software and copyrights that are owned by siemens ag and were not
transferred to se global gmbh & co. kg but which are used by the gas and power business,
siemens ag granted se global gmbh & co. kg non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual,

which have been purchased by the gas and power business prior to the effective date of the
carve-out are neither transferred nor licensed to se global gmbh & co. kg. se global gmbh &
co. kg may continue to purchase such products or services from siemens ag and its affiliates.
with regard to certain technologies, products, services and related ip, the parties agreed to
find separate case specific solutions which may deviate from the german contribution
agreement, e.g., in relation to siemens ag’s remote service platform crsp by means of a

in connection with a contract for the construction of the “olkiluoto 3” nuclear power plant in
finland for teollisuuden voima oyj (tvo), siemens ag will continue to be externally liable vis-à
-vis tvo and siemens ag’s consortium partners. due to a significant delay of the project, tvo
will likely raise delay claims against the consortium or may pursue termination of the contract,
potentially triggering additional significant claims from tvo. as between siemens ag and
siemens energy, siemens energy will be responsible for the execution of the project. siemens ag
has agreed to cover certain potential claims of tvo, to the extent these claims exceed
€ 83 million. however, in certain cases siemens energy may have to first satisfy such claims vis-à
-vis tvo and may only be able to obtain relief from siemens ag following legal proceedings
against siemens ag’s consortium partners. as a result, siemens energy may not be able to obtain
the aforementioned relief in time or in full, which could have a significant financial impact on
siemens energy. apart from the foregoing, siemens energy will be entitled to all benefits and
bear all risks associated with the project execution and siemens ag’s position as a party to the
consortium agreement, including risks related to delays or non-completion of the project. any of

siemens energy in a variety of financing and treasury fields, such as factoring, financing and
leasing,debt,commercialandequityfinancing,theprovisionofsoftwareforthemanagementof
currency risks or other treasury related services. following the spin-off, siemens group
companies will generally not provide financing or finance and treasury services to siemens
energy, with the exception of certain it-tools, or in relation to the preferred financing
agreement (see “18.1.1.1.3(2) preferred financing agreement”), and siemens and siemens
energy will continue to be bound by guarantee facility agreements (see “18.1.1.1.3(3) guarantee
facilityagreement(s)”).
(1) securitiesissuedbybanksorthesiemensgroup
letters of support and other securities provided by siemens ag in favor of banks, insurance
companies and other financial institutions which have granted loans or provided other financing
products (loans, securities, documentary letters of credit, derivatives) to the siemens energy
group companies are intended to be replaced by siemens energy ag after the spin-off
completion.

than sgre) with banks and insurance companies. however, the respective siemens energy group
company is liable vis-à-vis the relevant siemens group company for any obligation in relation to
the securities. se global gmbh & co. kg agreed with siemens ag to be jointly and severally
liableforsuchobligations.thisappliestothefollowingsecurities:
(cid:129) siemens ag has issued letters of support and other securities for local credit, guarantee, surety
and documentary letter of credit lines as well as currency, interest and commodity price
hedging transactions of siemens energy group companies (with the exception of sgre) for the
benefit of banks and insurance companies as well as other financial institutions. as of june 30,
2020, credit, guarantee, surety and documentary letter of credit lines as well as currency,
interest and commodity price hedging transactions in the amount of approximately € 7 billion
were secured through letters of support or other securities of siemens ag. not included are

the exception of sgre) the volume is approximately € 23.7 billion as of june 30, 2020. this
amount was calculated on the assumption that the amount of liability under accessory parent
company guarantees, to the extent that these are unlimited, correspond in general to the
value of the secured delivery or service agreement recognized for its term. following the
spin-off completion, the initial value of the secured delivery or service agreement shall be
reduced linearly over the planned term of such agreement, resulting in a corresponding
reduction of the accessory liability amount of the respective parent company guarantee and
the calculation of the fees owed in relation to a parent company guarantee for its provision
shall be based on such reduced amount, unless a differing risk assessment and increased
amountofliabilityisjustified(suchamounta“risk-adequateliabilityamount”).

under the master separation agreement, se global gmbh & co. kg shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to procure that siemens group companies are discharged from the above-
mentioned securities. until such discharge, se global gmbh & co. kg, starting six months after
spin-off completion, shall report quarterly to siemens ag on the measures undertaken to

companies and shall be discharged and replaced with a letter of support or other securities
granted by siemens energy ag after the spin-off completion. until such letters of support are
replaced, siemens energy shall pay a fee to siemens. letters of support provided by siemens
ag shall terminate on april 30, 2021, at the latest. the fees for the fiscal year 2021 shall
amount to approximately € 1 million if there is no early replacement. in principle, outstanding
securities shall not be amended or extended after the spin-off completion; in particular, no
amendment or extension shall be made that would increase the risk for siemens group
companies. until expiration or discharge of the securities, siemens energy companies shall pay
the agreed fees. payment obligations towards siemens ag and other siemens group
companies are secured by se global gmbh & co. kg. for the fiscal year 2021, fees for such
securities are estimated to amount to € 29 million (without fees for securities provided in
favor of sgre). for the fiscal years thereafter, continuous reductions of such amount are
expected due to the expiration and/or discharge of such securities or because of the above-
mentionedlineardepreciationoftheguaranteedvaluesovertheirterm.

to the extent siemens group companies have themselves issued or shall issue securities,
siemens energy shall endeavor to agree with the beneficiaries that the beneficiaries will, at a

(2) preferredfinancingagreement
onmarch31,2020,seglobalgmbh&co.kgandsiemensagenteredintoapreferredfinancing
agreement (the “preferred financing agreement”) which becomes effective as of the spin-off
completion. it governs the non-exclusive cooperation in the areas of debt and commercial
financing (in particular leasing) as well as equity financing of gas and power customers and their
projects (including power plant projects) at arm’s length. debt financing comprises the provision
of debt capital via standard market debt financing structures. standardfinanceleasing structures
can also be the subject of cooperation. in general, no recourse to siemens energy group
companiesshallbemadeinconnectionwithdebtfinancingandfinanceleasestructures.
the following framework conditions were agreed for equity financing (in particular for project
companies):
(cid:129) for equity financing in the first five years of the term of the preferred financing agreement,
siemens ag has agreed to make available an investment volume of up to € 300 million per
annum. for the following five-year period, the parties agreed that any sales revenue from the
equity portfolio of assets acquired within the first five years under the preferred financing
agreement, but at least € 500 million, shall be available for new equity investments under the
preferred financing agreement. for equity financing, siemens ag’s individual investment
decisionfollowsaportfolioapproachwhichtakesintoaccountnewandexistinginvestments.
(cid:129) in addition, equity financings up to a total volume of € 210 million may be made in
extraordinary cases by siemens ag via a recourse model, subject to full recourse to se global
gmbh & co. kg or siemens energy ag. in such cases, profits and losses resulting from the
investments shall be borne by se global gmbh & co. kg or siemens energy ag. siemens ag
bearstheriskthatrecoursetoseglobalgmbh&co.kgorsiemensenergyagmayfail.
services under the preferred financing agreement shall be provided by sfs and its associated
financingcompaniesincludingsiemensbankgmbh.
the preferred financing agreement has a fixed term until september 30, 2030. however, either
party may prematurely terminate the preferred financing agreement, among other reasons, if
(i) siemens directly or indirectly holds less than 25% of the shares and/or voting rights in the
company (excluding shares directly or indirectly held by siemens pension-trust e.v. and/or any
other entity holding or managing plan assets under or in connection with siemens group’s
benefit plans) or (ii) another shareholder of the company, either individually or acting in concert
with others, holds 25% or more of the shares and/or voting rights in the company or exercises
control over the company, in both cases, (i) and (ii), with a phase-out period of 36 months from
the receipt of an effective termination notice. in the case of a termination pursuant to item (i),
however, the receipt of a termination notice during the first three years of the term of the
preferred financing agreement results in the 36-month phase notice period commencing on the
third anniversary of the spin-off completion. either party may also, subject to certain further
conditions, inter alia, terminate the preferred financing agreement if the other party has failed
in the performance of any material obligations or the respective other party becomes insolvent

(3) guaranteefacilityagreement(s)
the relevant siemens companies and siemens energy companies have concluded guarantee
facility agreements in all countries where securities for the obligations of siemens energy group
companies (other than sgre) are existing on the date of the facility agreement and/or are being
issued, extended, renewed or amended until and excluding the spin-off completion. the
guaranteefacility agreementsrelate tosecurities thathavebeenissuedbysiemenscompaniesor
that siemens companies have instructed under their guarantee facility agreements with banks or
insurance companies. in countries where a reverse-carve outtookplace, similar guaranteefacility
agreements have been or will be entered into on a vice versa basis with exchanged roles of
siemens companies (requesting a guarantee) and siemens energy companies (providing the
guarantee). siemens may provide corporate securities after spin-off completion for contracts
relating to the siemens energy business that could not be transferred to siemens energy. it is
472
intended to individually agree that the terms and conditions of the guarantee facility
agreements, relating to classical carve-outs and reverse carve-outs, mentioned in this paragraph
willapply.
(4) leaseagreements,purchaseofreceivables
certain siemens energy group companies have in the past entered into and continue to enter
into lease agreements with sfs. the siemens energy group companies act as lessee. the lease
agreements mostly focus on operating leasing. such agreements are rent-like lease agreements
with relatively long terms of usually one to ten years covering mobile assets, in particular various
logistics, production and test equipment. generally, there is no ordinary right of termination.
siemens energygroupcompanies also enteredinto financeleaseagreementsthatcovermovable
assets and typically have terms between two and eight years with no ordinary right of
termination. siemens energy group companies have in the past entered into and may continue
to enter into purchase agreements for receivables with sfs, where the siemens energy group
companies act as sellers of receivables to finance themselves. the receivables sold are from the
companies’operatingbusiness.thepurchasedreceivablesusuallyhavearemainingtermofupto

(5) cashmanagement;hedging
the system of intercompany clearing accounts and cash management (including cash pooling)
between the siemens energy group and the siemens group shall be terminated in connection
with the spin-off completion. therefore, the balances from the cash management system
between siemens ag and se global gmbh & co. kg existing at that time will be settled via

arise from the provision of goods and services, the settlement of hedges and other treasury
transactions between siemens companies. under an agency agreement and its amendment
agreement existing between siemens ag and se global gmbh & co. kg, siemens ag instructs
se global gmbh & co. kg, as the central treasury unit of siemens energy, to establish a
clearing account star (verrechnungskontenstern) for the siemens energy group companies
(without sgre) starting as of january 1, 2020 and to maintain clearing accounts for the
siemens energy group companies (without sgre). the agreement shall end upon spin-off
completion.
(cid:129) the balance transfer agreements were concluded between (i) siemens ag and (ii), as the case
may be other treasury companies of the siemens group which like siemens ag maintain
clearing accounts for siemens energy companies, (iii) se global gmbh & co. kg and (iv) the

18.1.1.1.4 trademarkandnameuse(sub-)licenseagreementwithsiemensenergy
on march 31, 2020, siemens ag and se global gmbh & co. kg entered into a trademark and
name use (sub-) license agreement (the “se tla”) that shall enter into force with the spin-off
completion. after the spin-off has taken effect, the se tla may be transferred to siemens
energyagwiththeapprovalofsiemensagwhichmaynotbeunreasonablywithheld.
under the se tla, siemens ag grants se global gmbh & co. kg the exclusive right to, among
other things, use the combined designation “siemens energy” in the company name, internet
and e-mail domains and the trademarks “siemens energy” as corporate mark and as product
mark (the “se mark”) as well as the non-exclusive right to use certain “si-” product marks (the
“se licensed designations”). the right to use the se licensed designations is granted for the
business field in which the siemens segment gas and power was active as of october 1, 2019 or
which were defined in the business mandate of this segment at that time (including certain
products and services that were the subject of r&d activities ongoing at that time) with the
exceptionofthebusinessareaofsgre(the“securrentfield”).
siemens ag shall also neither use nor otherwise license the “siemens energy” trademark outside
ofthesecurrentfield.setladoesnot,however,preventsiemensagfromoperatingunderthe
trademark “siemens” with or without further additions (with the exception of the addition
“energy”)inthesecurrentfieldorfuturebusinessareasofseglobalgmbh&co.kg.
for the duration of the se tla, se global gmbh & co. kg is obligated to use the designation
“siemens energy” as the company name and the trademark “siemens energy” in the se current
field at all application levels (company and product trademark). businesses conducted under
third-party trademarks (e.g., “guascor” or “trench”) at the time of the conclusion of the se tla
shall continue to be managed separately. with respect to the business managed under “dresser-
rand”, se global gmbh & co. kg is free to either continue to manage this business separately or
to convert it to “siemens energy”. in the event that se global gmbh & co. kg, within the se
current field, acquires a business from a third party or forms a joint venture over which it has
control, then se global gmbh & co. kg may decide, in its own discretion, whether the newly
acquiredbusinessshallusethe“siemensenergy”trademarkundertheconditionssetforthabove
or whether the business shall be conducted within a separate company without the use of the
designation“siemensenergy”.
to the extent that se global gmbh & co. kg engages in new business areas outside of the se
current field that do not overlap with siemens’ business fields at the time, either through
organic growth or acquisitions, the parties to the se tla, upon the request of se global gmbh &
co. kg, shall discuss an expansion in good faith, the consent to which siemens ag may not
unreasonablywithhold, subject todetailedprovisions which set forth theconditionsunderwhich
siemens ag may provide its consent for the expansion of the business fields under the se tla.
however, in case of an overlap with siemens business fields no expansion shall be granted. if
siemens ag does not permit the use of the trademark, se global gmbh & co. kg may only
474
operate in the new business area through a separate company which is not entitled to use the
nameandtrademark“siemensenergy”.
se global gmbh & co. kg is entitled and (with the exception of the above-mentioned business
conducted under third-party trademarks) obligated to grant a sublicense to affiliated companies,
including siemens energy ag, for the use of the “siemens energy” trademark in accordancewith
the provisions of the se tla and to ensure that they are obligated to use the designation
“siemensenergy”inthesecurrentfield.
se global gmbh & co. kg shall pay a margin-based license fee for the use of the “siemens
energy” trademark. this license fee depends on the ebita margin of siemens energy (excluding
sgre) as adjusted for certain special items as set forth in the se tla (“tla specific ebita
margin”) and ranges between 0.3% (if the tla specific ebita margin is less than or equal to
6.5%) and 1.2% (if the tla specific ebita margin is equal to or greater than 9%) of revenue
(excluding sales tax) generated with products and services under the “siemens energy”
trademark or, until the transition to the “siemens energy” trademark, under the “siemens”
trademark. based on a projection as of june 30, 2020, the license fee to be paid by se global
gmbh & co. kgfor fiscal year2020would amounttoamid-double-digit million eurofigure. the
adequacyofthelicensefeeshallbereviewedatregularintervals.
the se tla has a fixed initial term of ten years and automatically extends by further 3-year
revolving term unless terminated by either party. siemens ag may terminate the se tla with
immediate effect, subject to staggered transition periods, upon the occurrence of certain
terminationeventsincludingthefollowing:

spin-off completion. with some exceptions, they have terms between twelve and 36 months. in
total, siemens and siemens energy have concluded more than 350 tsas and more than
1,000 lsas. the expected total contract volumes over the entire term of the contracts are
approximately € 280 million for tsas and approximately € 1.2 billion for lsas. the tsas

19 taxation of shareholders in germany
the tax laws of any jurisdiction with authority to impose taxes on the company’s shareholders
and the tax laws of the company’s country of incorporation (i.e., germany) may have an
impactontheincomereceivedfromtheshares.
the following section presents a number of key german taxation principles which generally are
or can be relevant to the acquisition, holding or transfer of shares both by a shareholder (an
individual, a partnership or corporation) that has a tax domicile in germany (that is, whose place
of residence, habitual abode, registered office or place of management is in germany) and by a
shareholder without a tax domicile in germany. however, it does not address the tax
consequences for the shareholders of siemens ag that arise in connection with the spin-off. the
information is not exhaustive and does not constitute a definitive explanation of all possible
aspects of taxation that could be relevant for shareholders. the information is based on the tax
laws in force in germany as of the date of the prospectus (and their interpretation by
administrative directives and courts) as well as typical provisions of double taxation treaties that
germany has concluded with other countries. tax law can change – sometimes retrospectively.
moreover, it cannot be ruled out that the german tax authorities or courts may consider an
alternative interpretation or application to be correct that differs from the one described in this
section.
this section cannot serve as a substitute for tailored tax advice to individual shareholders.
shareholders are therefore advised to consult their tax advisers regarding the tax implications of
the acquisition, holding or transfer of shares and regarding the procedures to be followed to
achieve a possible reimbursement of german withholding tax (kapitalertragsteuer). only such
advisers are in a position to take the specific tax-relevant circumstances of individual
shareholdersintodueaccount.
19.1 income tax implications of the holding, sale and transfer of shares
in terms of the taxation of shareholders of the company, a distinction must be made between
taxation in connection with the holding of shares (“19.2 taxation of dividends”) and taxation in
connection with the sale of shares (“19.3 taxation of capital gains”) and taxation in connection
withthegratuitoustransferofshares(“19.5inheritanceandgifttax”).
19.2 taxation of dividends
19.2.1 withholdingtax
as a general rule, dividends distributed to the shareholder are subject to a withholding tax
(kapitalertragsteuer) of 25.0% and a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon (i.e., 26.375% in total
plus church tax, if applicable). this, however, will not apply if and to the extent that dividend
payments are funded from the company’s contribution account for tax purposes (steuerliches
einlagekonto; § 27 körperschaftsteuergesetz, “kstg”); in this case no withholding tax will be
withheld. however, these payments will reduce the acquisition costs of the shares and may,
consequently, result in or increase a taxable gain upon the disposal of the shares (see below at
“19.3 taxation of capital gains”). the assessment basis for the withholding tax is the dividend
approvedbythegeneralshareholders’meeting.

domestic securities trading bank (inländische wertpapierhandelsbank) which keeps or
administers the shares and disburses or credits the dividends to the shareholder or disburses the

if and to the extent shares held in collective custody (sammelverwahrung) by the central
securities depository (wertpapiersammelbank) are treated as so-called “abgesetzte bestände”
(stock being held separately) (hereinafter in all cases, the “dividend paying agent”). aside from
the case of stock being held separately, the company does not assume any responsibility for the
withholdingofthewithholdingtax.
in general, the withholding tax must be withheld without regard as to whether and to what
extent the dividend is exempt from (corporate) income tax at the level of the shareholder and
whethertheshareholderisdomiciledingermanyorabroad.
however, withholding tax on dividends distributed to a company domiciled in another eu
member state within the meaning of article 2 of the council directive 2011/96/eu of
november 30, 2011, as amended (“parent-subsidiary directive”), may be refunded upon
application and subject to further conditions. this also applies to dividends distributed to a
permanent establishment of such a parent company in another eu member state or to a parent
company that is subject to unlimited tax liability in germany, provided that the participation in
the company is actually part of such permanent establishment’s business assets. further
requirements for the refund of withholding tax under the parent-subsidiary directive are that
the shareholder has directly held at least 10.0% of the company’s registered share capital
continuously for one year and that a respective application is filed with the german federal
central tax office (bundeszentralamt für steuern, hauptdienstsitz bonn-beuel, an der küppe 1,
d-53225 bonn, germany). if, in the case of a holding of at least 10.0% of the company’s
registered share capital, shares held in collective custody (sammelverwahrung) by the german
central securities depository (wertpapiersammelbank) clearstream banking ag are treated as
so-called “abgesetzte bestände” (stock being held separately), the german tax authorities will
not object when the main paying agent (hauptzahlstelle) of the company upon presentation of
a valid exemption certificate (freistellungsbescheinigung) and of a proof that this stock has been
held separately, disburses the dividend without deducting withholding tax. an exemption
certificate can be granted upon application (using official application forms) with the german
federalcentraltaxoffice(bundeszentralamtfürsteuern)(attheaboveaddress).
with respect to distributions made to shareholders not tax resident in germany, the withholding
tax may be at least partially refunded in accordance with an applicable double taxation treaty
germany has entered into with the respective shareholder’s country of residence if the shares
neither form part of the assets of a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business in
germany, nor form part of business assets for which a permanent representative in germany has
been appointed. the withholding tax refund is generally granted by the german federal central
taxoffice (at theaboveaddress) uponapplication in suchamannerthatthedifferencebetween
the total amount withheld, including the solidarity surcharge, and the reduced withholding tax
actually owed under the relevant double taxation treaty (generally 15.0%) is refunded by the
german federalcentraltaxoffice. arefundis notrequiredif thefederalcentraltaxoffice has,
upon application on the officially prescribed form, issued an exemption certificate
(freistellungsbescheinigung) which documents that the prerequisites for the application of the
reduced withholding tax rates have been met. dividends covered by the exemption certificate of
the shareholder are then only subject to the reduced withholding tax rates stipulated in the
exemptioncertificate.
forms for the reimbursement and the exemption from the withholding at source procedure are
available at the german federal central tax office (at the above address or online at h t t ps://
www.bzst.de).
if dividends are distributed to corporations subject to non-resident taxation in germany, i.e.,
corporations with no registered office or place of management in germany and if the shares
neither belong to the assets of a permanent establishment or fixed place of business in germany
nor are part of business assets for which a permanent representative in germany has been
491
appointed, two-fifths of the tax withheld at the source can generally be refunded even if not all
of the prerequisites for a refund under the parent-subsidiary directive or an applicable double
taxation treaty are fulfilled. the relevant application forms are available at the german federal
centraltaxoffice(attheaboveaddress).
the aforementioned possibilities for an exemption from or a refund of withholding tax depend
on certain other conditions being met (particularly the fulfillment of so-called “substance
requirements”–substanzerfordernisse).
pursuant to a special rule, the aforementioned withholding tax reliefs as well as the credit of
withholdingtaxdescribedinthesection“19.2.2taxationofdividendsofshareholderswithatax

intheeventthatashareholdertaxresidentingermanydoesnotmeettheaforementionedthree
requirements, three fifths of the withholding tax levied on the dividends (i.e., 15.0% of the
dividends) is not creditable, but may, upon application, be deducted when determining the
shareholder’s taxable income in an assessment procedure. shareholders who do not meet the
requirements but who have, nevertheless, not suffered a withholding tax deduction on the
dividends (for example, due to the presentation of a non-assessment certificate) or have already
obtained a refund of the taxes withheld, areobligedtonotify their competenttaxoffice thereof

amount will be equal to 15.0% of the dividends from january 1, 2019 onwards. the special rule
on the restriction of withholding tax credit does not apply to a shareholder if either (i) his or her
amount of dividend income on shares (including shares of the company) and certain profit
participation rights (genussrechte) does not exceed an amount of € 20,000 in a given tax
assessment period or if (ii) he or she has been, upon actual receipt of the dividend, the economic
owner of the shares for a continuous period of at least one year, whereby shares of the

in the event that a shareholder not tax resident in germany does not meet the aforementioned
three requirements, a refund of the withholding tax pursuant to a double taxation treaty is not
available. this restriction only applies if (i) the applicable double taxation treaty provides for a
tax reduction leading to an applicable tax rate of less than 15.0%, (ii) the shareholder is not a
corporation that directly holds at least a participation of 10.0% of the equity capital of the

withholding tax will not be withheld by a dividend paying agent if the shareholder provides

extent such shareholder’s capital income does not exceed the annual lump-sum deduction
(sparer-pauschbetrag) of € 801 (€ 1,602 for married couples and registered partners jointly

19.2.2 taxationofdividendsofshareholderswithataxdomicileingermany
this section applies to shareholders with a tax domicile in germany (i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is
locatedingermany).
19.2.2.1 sharesheldasnon-businessassets
dividends distributed to shareholders with a tax domicile in germany whose shares are held as
non-business assets form part of their taxable capital investment income, which is subject to a
specialuniformincometaxrateof25.0%plussolidarity surchargeof5.5%thereon(i.e.,26.375%
in total plus church tax, if applicable). the income tax owed for this dividend income is generally
satisfied by the withholding tax withheld by the dividend paying agent (flat-rate withholding
tax (abgeltungsteuer)). income-related expenses cannot be deducted from the shareholder’s
capital investment income (including dividends), except for an annual lump-sum deduction
(sparer-pauschbetrag) of € 801 (€ 1,602 for married couples and registered partners jointly
assessed). however, the shareholder may request that his capital investment income (including
dividends) along with his other taxable income be subject to a progressive income tax rate
(instead of the uniform tax rate for capital investment income) if this results in a lower tax
burden. in this case, income-related expenses cannot be deducted from the capital investment
income,exceptfortheaforementionedannuallump-sumdeduction.
if the withholding tax deduction does not satisfy (abgelten) the tax liability of the shareholder,
the withholding tax will generally be credited against the progressive income tax and any excess
amount will be refunded if the requirements of the special rule on the restriction of withholding
taxcredit(seeabove“19.2.1withholdingtax”)arefulfilled.
exceptions from the flat-rate withholding tax also apply upon application for shareholders who
have a shareholding of at least 25.0% in the company and for shareholders who have a
shareholding of at least 1.0% in the company and are able to entrepreneurially influence the
business activities of the company through a professional work for the company. in this
situation,thetaxtreatmentdescribedbelowat“19.2.2.2.2soleproprietors”)applies.
fortaxpayers,subjecttochurchtax,suchtaxwillbewithheldbywayofanautomatedprocedure
and remitted to the religious community levying the tax. church tax withheld at source may not
be deducted as a special expense (sonderausgabe) in the course of the tax assessment, but the
dividend paying agent may reduce the standard withholding tax rate (including the solidarity
surcharge of 26.375%) by the church tax to be withheld on the dividends. where shareholders
have lodged a timely written objection with the german federal central tax office
(bundeszentralamt für steuern (at the above address)) (so-called “blocking notice” –
sperrvermerk) as regardstheautomatedretrieval ofdataontheir religious affiliation, churchtax
will not be automatically deducted. in this case, a shareholder subject to church tax is obliged to
declare the dividends in his income tax return. the church tax on the dividends is then levied by
wayofataxassessment.
shareholders who are subject to german tax residents’ taxation and hold their shares as
non-business assets may be paid the dividends without deduction of withholding tax if certain
493
prerequisites are met, in particular, if the shareholder has provided a non-assessment certificate
(nichtveranlagungs-bescheinigung) or an exemption instruction (freistellungsauftrag) and the
exemptamountindicatedthereinhasnotyetbeenexhausted.
as an exemption, dividend payments that are funded from the company’s contribution account
for tax purposes (steuerliches einlagekonto; § 27 kstg) and are paid to shareholders with a tax
domicile in germany whose shares are held as non-business assets, do – contrary to the above –
not form part of the shareholder’s taxable income but reduce the acquisition costs for the
underlying shares. this results in a higher capital gain in the event of the shares’ disposal (see
below at “19.3 taxation of capital gains”). however, this will not apply if (i) the shareholder or,
intheeventofagratuitoustransfer,itslegalpredecessor,or,iftheshareshavebeengratuitously
transferred several times in succession, one of his legal predecessors at any point during the five
years preceding the (deemed, as the case may be,) disposal directly or indirectly held at least
1.0% of the share capital of the company (a “qualified holding”) and (ii) the dividend payment
funded from the company’s contribution account for tax purposes exceeds the actual acquisition
costs of the shares. in such a case of a qualified holding, a dividend payment funded from the
company’s contribution account for tax purposes is deemed a sale of the shares and is taxable as
a capital gain if and to the extent the dividend payment funded from the company’s
contribution account for tax purposes exceeds the acquisition costs of the shares. in this case the
taxation corresponds with the description in the section “19.3.1.1 shares held as non-business
assets”madewithregardtoshareholdersmaintainingaqualifiedholding.
19.2.2.2 sharesheldasbusinessassets
dividendsfromsharesheldasbusinessassetsofashareholderwithataxdomicileingermanyare
not subject to the flat-rate withholding tax. however, dividends are generally subject to the
withholding tax on capital investment income of 25.0% plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge thereon,
resulting in an aggregate tax rate of 26.375%, plus church tax for individuals, if applicable. the
withholding tax (including the solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable) withheld and
paidbythedividendpayingagentwill generallybecreditedagainsttheshareholder’sincomeor
corporate income tax liability (including the solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable) or
refunded in the amount of any excess if the requirements of the special rule on the restriction of
withholding tax credit (see above “19.2.1 withholding tax”) are fulfilled. the taxation depends
on whether the shareholder is a corporation, a sole proprietor or a partnership
(co-entrepreneurship).
dividend payments that are funded from the company’s contribution account for tax purposes
(steuerliches einlagekonto; § 27 kstg) and are paid to shareholders with a tax domicile in
germany whose shares are held as business assets, are generally fully tax-exempt in the hands of
such shareholder but reduce the acquisition costs for the underlying shares. to the extent the
dividendpaymentsfundedfromthecompany’scontributionaccountfortaxpurposesexceedthe
actual acquisition costs of the shares, a taxable capital gain occurs. the taxation of such gain
corresponds with the description in the section “19.3.1.2 shares held as business assets” made
withregardtoshareholderswhosesharesareheldasbusinessassets.
19.2.2.2.1 corporations
if the shareholder is a corporation with a tax domicile in germany, the dividends are in general
effectively 95.0% exempt from corporate income tax and the solidarity surcharge. 5.0% of the
dividends aretreatedasnon-deductiblebusiness expensesandarethereforesubject tocorporate

exempt from corporate income tax (including solidarity surcharge thereon), if the shareholder
only holds a direct participation of less than 10.0% in the company’s registered share capital at
the beginning of the calendar year (“portfolio participation” – streubesitzbeteiligung).
participations of at least 10.0% acquired during a calendar year are deemed to have been
acquiredatthebeginningofthecalendaryear. participations whichashareholderholdsthrough

a partnership (including those that are co-entrepreneurships (mitunternehmerschaften)) are
attributable to the shareholder only on a pro rata basis at the ratio of the interest share of the
shareholderintheassetsoftherelevantpartnership.
dividends (after deducting business expenses economically related to the dividends) are subject

special rules apply to dividends received by companies active in the financial and insurance
sectors, as well as pension funds (see below “19.4 special treatment of companies in the
financialandinsurancesectorsandpensionfunds”).
19.2.2.2.2 soleproprietors
if the shares are held as business assets by a sole proprietor with a tax domicile in germany, only
60.0%ofthedividends aresubject toaprogressiveincometax(plusthesolidarity surcharge)ata
total tax rate of up to approximately 47.5%, known as the partial income method
(teileinkünfteverfahren).thepartialincomemethoddoesnotapplywithrespecttochurchtax(if
applicable). only 60.0% of the business expenses economically related to the dividends are
tax-deductible. if the shares belong to a domestic permanent establishment in germany of a
business operation of the shareholder, the dividend income (after deducting business expenses
economically related thereto) is not only subject to income tax but is also fully subject to trade
tax, unless the shareholder held at least 15.0% of the company’s registered share capital at the
beginning of the relevant tax assessment period. in this latter case, the net amount of dividends,
i.e., after deducting directly related expenses, is exempt from trade tax. as a rule, trade tax can
be credited against the shareholder’s personal income tax, either in full or in part, by means of a
lump-sum tax credit method, depending on the level of the municipal trade tax multiplier and
certainindividualtax-relevantcircumstancesofthetaxpayer.
19.2.2.2.3 partnerships
if the shareholder is a partnership with a tax domicile in germany, the income or corporate
income tax, as the case may be, and the solidarity surcharge are not levied at the level of the
partnership but at the level of the respective partner. the taxation for every partner depends on
whether the partner is a corporation or an individual. if the partner is a corporation, the
dividends contained in the profit share of the shareholder will be taxed in accordance with the
principles applicable for corporations (see “19.2.2.2.1 corporations” above). if the partner is an
individual, the taxation is in line with the principles described for sole proprietors (see
“19.2.2.2.2 sole proprietors” above). upon application and subject to further conditions, an
individualasapartnercanhavehispersonalincometaxrateloweredforearningsnotwithdrawn
fromthepartnership.
in addition, the dividends are generally subject to trade tax in the full amount at the level of a
commercial or deemed commercial partnership if the shares are attributed to a german
permanent establishment of the partnership. if a partner of the partnership is an individual, the
portion of the trade tax paid by the partnership pertaining to his profit share will generally be
credited, either in full or in part, against his personal income tax by means of a lump-sum
method – depending on the level of the municipal trade tax multiplier and certain individual
tax-relevant circumstances ofthetaxpayer. if thepartnership heldatleast 15%ofthecompany’s
registered share capital at the beginning of the relevant tax assessment period, the dividends
(after deduction of business expenses economically related thereto) should generally not be
subject to trade tax. in this case, trade tax should, however, be levied on 5% of the dividends to
the extent they are attributable to the profit share of a corporate partner to whom at least 10%
of the shares in the company are attributable on a look-through basis, since this portion of the
dividends should be deemed to be non-deductible business expenses. the remaining portion of
495
the dividend income attributable to partners other than such specific corporate partners (which
includes individual partners and should, according to a literal reading of the law, also include
corporate partners to whom, on a look-through basis, only portfolio participations are
attributable) should not be subject to trade tax. due to a lack of case law and administrative
guidance, the exact application of the rules for the taxation of dividends from portfolio
participations (see “19.2.2.2.1 corporations” above) is, however, unclear. shareholders are
stronglyrecommendedtoconsulttheirtaxadvisers.
19.2.3 taxationofdividendsofshareholderswithanon-germantaxdomicile
shareholders without a tax domicile in germany, whose shares are attributable to a german
permanent establishment or fixed place of business or are part of business assets for which a
permanentrepresentative in germanyhasbeenappointed,areliablefortaxingermanyontheir
dividend income. in this respect the provisions outlined above for shareholders with a tax
domicile in germany whose shares are held as business assets apply accordingly (see
“19.2.2.2 shares held as business assets”). the withholding tax (including the solidarity
surcharge) withheld and passed on will generally be credited against the income or corporate
income tax liability or refunded in the amount of any excess if the requirements of the special
rule on the restriction of withholding tax credit (see above “19.2.1 withholding tax”) are
fulfilled.
in all other cases, any tax liability in germany for dividends received by shareholders resident
outside of germany will be discharged through the withholding of the withholding tax by the
dividend paying agent. a refund or exemption is granted only as discussed under
“19.2.1withholdingtax”above.
dividend payments that are funded from the company’s contribution account for tax purposes
(steuerlicheseinlagekonto;§27kstg)aregenerallynotsubjecttogermantaxation.
19.3 taxation of capital gains
19.3.1 taxationofcapitalgainsofshareholderswithataxdomicileingermany
this section applies to shareholders with a tax domicile in germany (i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is
locatedingermany).
19.3.1.1 sharesheldasnon-businessassets
gains on the disposal of shares acquired after december 31, 2008 by a shareholder with a tax
domicile in germany and held as non-business assets are generally – regardless of the holding
period – subject to a uniform tax rate on capital investment income in germany (25.0% plus the
solidaritysurchargeof5.5%thereon,i.e.,26.375%intotalplusanychurchtax,ifapplicable).
the taxable capital gain is equal to the difference between (a) the proceeds of the disposal and
(b) the acquisition costs of the shares plus the expenses related directly and materially to the
disposal. dividend payments that are funded from the company’s contribution account for tax
purposes (steuerliches einlagekonto; § 27 kstg) reduce the original acquisition costs; if dividend
payments that are funded from the company’s contribution account for tax purposes exceed the
acquisition costs, negative acquisition costs – which can increase a capital gain – can arise in case
of shareholders, whose shares are held as non-business assets and do not qualify as a qualified
holding.
only an annual lump-sum deduction of € 801 (€ 1,602 for married couples and registered
partners jointly assessed) may be deducted from the entire capital investments income. it is
generallynotpossibletodeductincome-relatedexpensesinconnectionwithcapitalgains,except
for the expenses directly related in substance to the disposal which can be deducted when
calculating the capital gains. losses from the disposal of shares may only be offset against profits
from capital investments arising from the disposal of the company’s shares or other shares in
stock corporations during the same assessment period or in future assessment periods.
496
furthermore, in case of a derecognition or transfer of worthless shares (or other capital assets),
the utilization of such loss is further restricted and can only be offset up to the amount of
€10,000percalendaryear.
if the shares are held in custody or administered by a domestic credit or financial services
institution, domestic securities trading company or a domestic securities trading bank, including
domestic branches of foreign credit institutions or financial service institutions, or if such an
office executes the disposal of the shares and pays out or credits the capital gains (each a
“domestic paying agent”), the tax on the capital gains will generally be satisfied by the
domestic paying agent withholding the withholding tax on investment income in the amount of
26.375% (including the solidarity surcharge) on the capital gain and transferring it to the tax
authority for the account of the seller. if the shares were held in custody or administered by the
respective domestic paying agent continuously after acquisition, the amount of tax withheld is
generally based on the difference between the proceeds from the sale, after deducting expenses
directlyrelatedtothesale,andtheamountpaidtoacquiretheshares.however,thewithholding
tax rate of 25.0% plus the 5.5% solidarity surcharge thereon and any church tax (if applicable),
will be applied to 30.0% of the gross sales proceeds if the shares were not administered by the
same custodian bank since acquisition and the original cost of the shares cannot be verified or
such verification is not admissible. in this case, the shareholder is entitled to, and in case the
actual gain is higher than 30% of the gross proceeds must, verify the original costs of the shares
inhisorherannualincometaxreturn.
the church tax deduction for capital gains is performed by way of standardized tax withholding
procedure by the domestic paying agent withholding such tax. the principles outlined above for
church tax on dividend income (see “19.2.2.1 shares held as non-business assets” above) apply
accordingly.
the shareholder can apply for his total capital investment income, together with his other
taxableincome,tobesubjecttoaprogressiveincometaxrateasopposedtotheuniformtaxrate
on investment income, if this results in a lower tax liability. in this case, the withholding tax is
credited against the progressive income tax and any resulting excess amount will be refunded.
limitations on offsetting losses are applicable. further, income-related expenses are
non-deductible,exceptfortheannuallump-sumdeduction.
shareholderswhoaresubjecttogermanresidents’taxationandholdtheirsharesasnon-business
assets may realize capital gains without deduction of tax on capital investment income and
solidarity surchargeif certain prerequisites aremet, particularly if theshareholderhasprovideda
non-assessment certificate (nichtveranlagungs-bescheinigung) or an exemption instruction
(freistellungsauftrag)andtheexemptamountindicatedthereinhasnotyetbeenexhausted.
if the withholding tax or, if applicable, the church tax on capital gains is not withheld by a
domestic paying agent, the shareholder is required to declare the capital gains in his income tax
return. the income tax and any applicable church tax on the capital gains will then be collected
bywayofassessment.
in case of a qualified holding, the capital gain deriving from the disposal of the shares is not
subjecttotheflat-ratewithholdingtax,buttotheprogressiveincometaxregime.inthiscasethe
partial income method applies to gains on the disposal of shares, which means that only 60.0%
of the capital gains are subject to tax and only 60.0% of the losses on the disposal and expenses
economically related thereto are tax deductible. even though withholding tax is withheld by a
domestic paying agent in the case of a qualified holding, this does not satisfy the tax liability of
the shareholder. consequently, a shareholder must declare his capital gains in his income tax
returns. the withholding tax (including the solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable)
withheld and paid will be credited against the shareholder’s income tax liability on his tax
assessment (including the solidarity surcharge and any church tax if applicable) or refunded in
theamountofanyexcess.
497
19.3.1.2 sharesheldasbusinessassets
gains on the sale of shares held as business assets of a shareholder with a tax domicile in
germany are not subject to a uniform withholding tax. withholding tax may only be withheld if
the shares are kept with a domestic paying agent. subject to certain prerequisites, the tax on
capital investment income withheld and remitted to the tax authorities will be imputed towards
the shareholder’s income tax liability and any excess amount paid will be refunded. subject to
certain requirements, however, the domestic paying agent may refrain from deducting tax on
capital investment income if (i) the shareholder is a corporation subject to german residents
taxation, an association of individuals or an estate or (ii) the shares form part of the business
assets of a business operation in germany and the shareholders declare such to the domestic
paying agent in the officially prescribed form. should the domestic paying agent nonetheless
have withheld tax on capital investment income, the tax withheld and remitted to the tax
authorities (including solidarity surcharge, and church tax, if applicable) will be credited against
the shareholder’s personal income tax or corporate income tax liability and any excess amount
paidwillberefunded.
the taxation of the capital gains depends on whether the shareholder is a corporation, a sole
proprietor or a partnership (co-entrepreneurship). dividend payments that are funded from the
company’s contribution account for tax purposes (steuerliches einlagekonto; § 27 kstg) reduce
the original acquisition costs. in the event of disposal, a higher taxable capital gain can arise
therefrom. if the dividend payments exceed the shares’ book value for tax purposes, a taxable
capitalgaincanarise.
19.3.1.2.1 corporations
if the shareholder is a corporation with a tax domicile in germany, the gains on the disposal of
shares are, in general, effectively 95.0% exempt from corporate income tax (including the
solidarity surcharge) and trade tax, regardless of the size of the participation and the holding
period. 5.0% of the gains are treated as non-deductible business expenses and are therefore
subject to corporate income tax (plus the solidarity surcharge) at a tax rate amounting to
15.825% and trade tax (depending on the municipal trade tax multiplier applied by the
respective municipal authority). as a rule, losses on disposals and other profit reductions in
connection with shares (for example, from a write-down) cannot be deducted as business
expenses.
special rules apply to capital gains realized by companies active in the financial and insurance
sectors, as well as pension funds (see below “19.4 special treatment of companies in the
financialandinsurancesectorsandpensionfunds”).
19.3.1.2.2 soleproprietors
if the shares are held as business assets by a sole proprietor with a tax domicile in germany, only
60.0% of the gains on the disposal of the shares are subject to a progressive income tax(plus the
solidarity surcharge) at a total tax rate of up to approximately 47.5% (partial-income method).
only 60.0% of the losses on the disposal and expenses economically related thereto are tax
deductible. the partial income method does not apply with respect to church tax (if applicable).
if the shares belong to a german permanent establishment of a business operation of the sole
proprietor,60.0%ofthegainsofthedisposalofthesharesare,inaddition,subjecttotradetax.
trade tax can be credited towards the shareholder’s personal income tax, either in full orin part,
by means of a lump-sum tax credit method – depending on the level of the municipal trade tax

19.3.2 taxationofcapitalgainsofshareholderswithanon-germantaxdomicile
capital gains derived from the disposal of shares by shareholders with no tax domicile in
germany are only subject to german tax if the selling shareholder has a qualified holding in the
company or the shares belong to a domestic permanent establishment or fixed place of business
or are part of business assets for which a permanent representative in germany has been
appointed.
pursuant to a decision of the german federal fiscal court (bundesfinanzhof) dated may 31, 2017
(federal tax gazette (bundessteuerblatt), part ii of 2018, p. 144), in case of a qualified holding,
thecapitalgainonthedisposalofsharesisnotsubjecttogermantaxationiftheshareholderisa
corporation which is not tax resident in germany and neither maintains a permanent
establishmentnorhasappointedapermanentrepresentativeingermany.
if the shareholder is a private individual, only 60.0% of the gains on the disposal of the shares
are subject to progressive income tax plus the solidarity surcharge thereon and church tax, if
applicable. however, most double taxation treaties provide for a partial or full relief from
german taxation and assign the right of taxation to the shareholder’s country of residence.
where a domestic paying agent is involved, withholding tax on capital gains is generally levied
atarateof25.0%(plus5.5%solidaritysurchargethereon,resultinginanaggregatewithholding
tax rate of 26.375%). however, if (i) the shares are not held through a permanent establishment

the german federal ministry of finance (bundesministerium der finanzen) on january 18, 2016,

with regard to gains or losses on the disposal of shares belonging to a domestic permanent

pertaining toshareholderswithataxdomicileingermanywhosesharesarebusinessassetsapply
accordingly (see “19.3.1.2 shares held as business assets”). the domestic paying agent can
refrain from deducting the withholding tax if the shareholder declares to the domestic paying

certainotherrequirementsaremet.

19.4 special treatment of companies in the financial and insurance sectors
and pension funds
ifcreditinstitutions(kreditinstitute)orfinancialservicesinstitutions(finanzdienstleistungsinstitute)
hold or sell shares that are allocable to their trading portfolio (handelsbestand) pursuant to
section340epara.3ofthegermancorporatecode(handelsgesetzbuch),theywillneitherbeable
to benefit from the partial income method nor be entitled to the effective 95.0% exemption from
corporate income tax plus the solidarity surcharge and any applicable trade tax. thus, dividend
income and capital gains are fully taxable. the same applies to shares acquired by financial
institutionsinthemeaningofthegermanbankingact(kreditwesengesetz)heldinthemajorityby
credit institutions or financial services institutions and where the shares are to be allocated to the
current assets (umlaufvermögen) as of the date of acquisition. the preceding sentence applies
accordingly for shares held in a permanent establishment in germany by financial institutions,
financialserviceinstitutionsandfinancialinstitutionstaxresidentinanothereumemberstateorin
othersignatorystatesofthetreatyontheeea.
likewise, the tax exemption described earlier afforded to corporations for dividend income and
capital gains from the sale of shares does not apply to shares that qualify as a capital investment
in the case of life insurance and health insurance companies, or those which are held by pension
funds.
however, an exemption to the foregoing, and thus a 95.0% effective tax exemption, applies to
dividends obtained by the aforementioned companies, to which the parent-subsidiary directive
applies. in addition, applicable double taxation treaties might provide further relief from
german tax, subject to certain prerequisites, e.g., substance requirements and holding periods,
beingmet.
19.5 inheritance and gift tax
the transfer of shares to another person by way of inheritance or gift is generally subject to
germaninheritanceorgifttaxif:
(i) the place of residence, habitual abode, place of management or registered office of the
decedent, the donor, the heir, the donee or another acquirer is, at the time of the asset
transfer, in germany, or such person, as a german national, has prior to the transfer not
spent more than generally five consecutive years outside of germany without maintaining a
placeofresidenceingermany;
(ii) the decedent’s or donor’s shares belonged to business assets for which there had been a
permanent establishment in germany or a permanent representative had been appointed;
or
(iii) the decedent or the donor, at the time of the succession or gift, held a direct or indirect
interest of at least 10.0% of the company’s share capital either alone or jointly with other
relatedparties.
the small number of double taxation treaties in respect of inheritance and gift tax which
germany has concluded to date usually provide for german inheritance or gift tax only to be
levied in the cases under (i) and, subject to certain restrictions, in the cases under (ii). special
provisions apply to certain german nationals living outside of germany and to former german
nationals.
19.6 abolishment of solidarity surcharge
on december 13, 2019, the law regarding a significant reduction of the solidarity surcharge
(gesetz zur rückführung des solidaritätszuschlags 1995) came into force. even though, this new
law has no impact on the solidarity surcharge levied in addition to the withholding tax, it can
affect the solidarity surcharge levied on the income tax liability which the withholding tax is
credited against, as the case may be. according to this new law the threshold as of which
solidarity surcharge is levied will be significantly increased, so that the solidarity surcharge shall
500
be abolished in full for approximately 90% of the german taxpayers and partly for a further
6.5% of german taxpayers. the new rules apply as of 2021. shareholders are advised to monitor
furtherfuturedevelopments.
19.7 other taxes
no german capital transfer taxes, value-added-tax, stamp duties or similar taxes are currently
levied on the purchase or disposal or other forms of transfer of the shares. however, an
entrepreneur may opt to subject disposals of shares, which are in principle exempt from value-
added-tax, to value-added-tax if the sale is made to another entrepreneur for the entrepreneur’s
business.wealthtaxiscurrentlynotleviedingermany.
on february 14, 2013, the eu commission adopted a proposal for a council directive (the “draft
directive”) on a common financial transaction tax (“ftt”) to be implemented in austria,
belgium, france, germany, greece, italy, portugal, spain, slovakia, and slovenia (the
“participating member states”). estonia has stated in 2015 that it will not participate in
implementingtheproposedftt.
the draft directive has a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in
the shares (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. the draft directive
focused on levying a ftt on financial transactions (as defined in the draft directive), including
the purchase, sale and exchange of financial instruments. under the draft directive, the rate of
thefttwouldnotbelowerthan0.1%(0.01%forderivatives), generallybasedontheamountof
the paid or owed consideration or in case of derivatives, the notional amount referred to in the
derivatives contract at the time of the financial transaction. the issuance and subscription of
sharesshould,however,beexempt.
sincethedateofthepublicationofthedraftdirective,discussionshavetakenplacebetweenthe
participating member states. according to a statement of the german federal ministry of
finance(bundesministerium derfinanzen) datedmay25,2020,theworkonthelegalframework
for the ftt is well advanced and shall be finalized in the second half of the calendar year 2020.
the ftt is expected to be modelled on the existing french ftt legislation. consequently, the ftt
is expected to apply to the acquisition of shares in domestic companies with a market
capitalizationofmorethan€1billionandatarateof0.2%.
nevertheless, the ftt remains subject to negotiation between the participating member states
and was (andmost probablywill be)thesubject oflegal challenge. it maystill bealteredprior to
itsadoption.moreover,onceanydirectivehasbeenadopted,itwillneedtobeimplementedinto
the respective domestic laws of the participating member states, and the domestic provisions
implementing the directive might deviatefrom thedirective itself. finally, additional eumember

prospective holders of the shares are advised to monitor future developments closely and should
consulttheirowntaxadvisersinrelationtotheconsequencesoftheftt.

20 certain u.s. federal income tax considerations
the following is a description of certain u.s. federalincome taxconsequencestotheu.s. holders
described below of the spin-off and of owning and disposing of new shares, but it does not
purport to be acomprehensivedescription ofall thetaxconsiderations thatmayberelevant toa
particular person. this discussion does not address u.s. state, local and non-u.s. tax
consequences. this discussion applies only to u.s. holders that, for u.s. federal income tax
purposes, hold siemens ag shares or adrs as capital assets, and (in the case of u.s. holders of
siemens ag’s shares receiving new shares in the spin-off) will hold the new shares as capital
assets. in addition, this discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be
relevant in light of a u.s. holder’s particular circumstances, including alternative minimum tax
consequences, the medicare contribution tax on net investment income and tax consequences
applicabletou.s.holderssubjecttospecialrules,suchas:

stockbyvoteorvalue;or
(cid:129) persons holding siemens ag shares, adrs or shares in connection with a trade or business
conductedoutsideoftheunitedstates.
if an entity that is classified as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes holds siemens
ag shares, adrs or new shares, the u.s. federal income tax treatment of apartnerwill generally
depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. partnerships holding
any such securities and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisers as to the
u.s. federal income tax consequences of the spin-off and of receiving, holding and disposing of
thenewshares.
this discussion is based on the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the “code”),
administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions, final, temporary and proposed u.s. treasury
regulations, and the income tax treaty between germany and the united states (the “treaty”),
allasofthedatehereof,anyofwhichissubjecttochange,possiblywithretroactiveeffect.
a “u.s. holder” is a person that for u.s. federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of
siemensagsharesoradrsand:
(cid:129) acitizenorindividualresidentoftheunitedstatesforu.s.federalincometaxpurposes;
(cid:129) a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the
lawsoftheunitedstates,anystatethereinorthedistrictofcolumbia;or
(cid:129) an estate or trust the income of which is subject to u.s. federal income taxation regardless of
itssource.
u.s. holders should consult their tax advisers concerning the u.s. federal, state, local and foreign
tax consequences of the spin-off and of receiving, owning and disposing of new shares in their
particularcircumstances.
this discussion assumes that siemens ag has not been, and the company will not be, a passive
foreigninvestment companyfor u.s. federalincome taxpurposes(a “pfic”) for anytaxableyear,
exceptasspecificallydescribedbelowunder“20.4passiveforeigninvestmentcompanyrules”.
502
20.1 tax consequences of the spin-off
the spin-off has not been structured to qualify as a tax-free transaction for u.s. federal income
tax purposes, and no ruling has been sought from the u.s. internal revenue service. siemens ag
believes that the distribution of new shares pursuant to the spin-off will constitute a taxable
distribution to u.s. holders with respect to siemens ag’s shares, to the extent of siemens ag’s
current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under u.s. federal income tax
principles). because siemens ag does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits under
u.s. federal income tax principles, it is expected that the distribution of new shares will be
reported to u.s. holders as a dividend. the amount of the dividend will equal the fair market
valueofthenewsharesonthedateofthespin-off,andau.s.holderwillhaveataxbasisinthe
newsharesequaltothatfairmarketvalue.
as described in section “5.3.6 adr program”, new shares that u.s. holders of adrs would
otherwise be entitled to receive in the spin-off will instead be sold by the depositary for cash on
behalf of the u.s. holders. u.s. holders of adrs will be treated as if they received a taxable
distribution of the new shares on the date of the spin-off and then sold such new shares for
cash when they are disposed of by thedepositary. u.s. holderswill recognizedividendincome in
an amount equal to the fair market value of the new shares on the date of the spin-off as
describedabove,andwillalsorecognizeshort-termcapitalgainorlossinanamountequaltothe
difference (if any) between the u.s. holder’s tax basis in the new shares and the amount of cash
realized onthesale ofthenewsharesbythedepositary (eachasdeterminedin u.s.dollars). the
u.s. holder’s tax basis in the new shares will be equal to their u.s. dollar value as of the date of
the spin-off (that is, the amount includible in income as dividend income as described above in
thisparagraph).
the dividend income will be foreign-source and u.s. holders will not be eligible for the
dividends-received deduction generally available to u.s. corporations under the code. subject to
applicablelimitations, dividendsincludedinincomeofcertainnon-corporateu.s.holdersmaybe
taxable at a favorable rate. such u.s. holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the
availabilityofthefavorabletaxrateondividendsintheirparticularcircumstances.
20.2 taxation of distributions on the new shares
distributions paid on new shares will generally be treated as dividends to the extent paid out of
the company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under u.s. federal
income tax principles). because the company will not maintain calculations of its earnings and
profits under u.s. federal income tax principles, it is expected that distributions generally will be
reported to u.s. holders as dividends. the amount of dividend income will include any amounts
withheld bythecompanyin respect ofgermantaxes. dividendswill betreatedasforeign-source
income to u.s. holders and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally
available tou.s. corporations underthecode.subjecttoapplicablelimitations, dividendspaidto
certain non-corporate u.s. holders may be taxable at a favorable rate. such u.s. holders should
consulttheirtaxadvisersregardingtheavailabilityofthefavorabletaxrateondividends.
dividends will be included in a u.s. holder’s income on the date of the u.s. holder’s receipt of
the dividend. the amountofanydividendpaidin euroswill betheu.s. dollar amountcalculated
by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the
payment is in fact converted into u.s. dollars. if the dividend is converted into u.s. dollars on the
dateofreceipt, au.s. holdershouldnotberequiredtorecognizeforeigncurrencygainorlossin
respect of the dividend income. a u.s. holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if the
dividendisconvertedintou.s.dollarsafterthedateofreceipt.
subject to applicable limitations, non-refundable german income taxes withheld from dividends
on new shares at a rate not exceeding the rate applicable under the treaty will be creditable
against the u.s. holder’s u.s. federal income tax liability. german taxes withheld in excess of the
rate applicable under the treaty or that are otherwise refundable will not be eligible for credit
against a u.s. holder’s federal income tax liability. the rules governing foreign tax credits are
503
complex, and u.s. holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the creditability of foreign
taxes in their particular circumstances. in lieu of claiming a foreign tax credit, u.s. holders may,
at their election, deduct foreign taxes, including german taxes, in computing their taxable
income, subject to generally applicable limitations under u.s. law. an election to deduct foreign
taxes instead of claiming foreign tax credits applies to all taxes paid or accrued in the taxable
yeartoforeigncountriesandpossessionsoftheunitedstates.
20.3 sale or other disposition of new shares
gain or loss realized on the sale or other disposition of new shares will be capital gain or loss,
and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the u.s. holder held the new shares for more than
one year. the amount of the gain or loss will equal the difference between the u.s. holder’s tax
basis in the shares disposed of and the amount realized on the disposition, in each case as
determined in u.s. dollars. this gain or loss will generally be u.s.-source gain or loss for foreign
tax credit purposes. the deductibility of capital losses is subject tolimitations. asdescribed under
section “19.3.2 taxation of capital gains of shareholders with a non-german tax domicile”, in
certain limited circumstances german tax may be imposed on disposition gains and u.s. holders
should consult their tax advisers regarding the credibility of any such taxes (and should be aware
that any such tax will generally not be creditable to the extent it is exempt undergermanlaw or
thetreaty).
20.4 passive foreign investment company rules
ingeneral,aforeigncorporationwillbeapficforanytaxableyearinwhich(i)75.0%ormoreof
its gross income consists of passive income (such as dividends, interest or certain rents and
royalties) or (ii) 50.0% or more of the average value of its assets (generally determined on a
quarterly basis) consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income.
if a corporation owns at least 25.0% (by value) of the stock of another corporation, the
corporation will be treated, for purposes of the pfic tests, as owning its proportionate share of
the 25.0%-owned corporation’s assets and receiving its proportionate share of the 25.0%-owned
corporation’sincome.
based upon the nature of its expected business, the company does not expect to be a pfic for its
current taxable year or in the foreseeable future. however, because pfic status depends on the
composition of a company’s income and assets and the market value of its assets from time to
time,therecanbenoassurancethatthecompanywillnotbeapficforanytaxableyear.
if the company were a pfic for any taxable year during which a u.s. holder held new shares,
gain recognized by a u.s. holder on a sale or other disposition (including certain pledges) of the
new shares would be allocated ratably over the u.s. holder’s holding period for the new shares.
theamountsallocated tothetaxableyearofthesaleorotherdispositionandtoanyyearbefore
the company became a pfic would be taxed as ordinary income. the amount allocated to each
other taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals or
corporations, as applicable, for that taxable year, and an interest charge would be imposed on
the tax attributable to the allocated amounts. further, to the extent that any distribution
received by a u.s. holder on its new shares exceeds 125.0% of the average of the annual
distributions on the new shares received during the preceding three years or the u.s. holder’s
holding period, whichever is shorter, that distribution would be subject to taxation in the same
manner as gain, described immediately above. certain elections may be available that would
resultinalternativetreatments(suchasmark-to-markettreatment)ofthenewshares.
asdescribedin“20.1taxconsequencesofthespin-off”,u.s.holderswill betreatedasreceiving
taxable distributions of new shares pursuant to the spin-off. generally, if siemens ag were a
pficforanytaxableyearduringtheu.s.holder’sholdingperiodofsiemensag’ssharesoradrs,
totheextentthatsuchdistributionexceeds125.0%oftheaverageoftheannualdistributionson
siemens ag shares or adrs received during the preceding three years or the u.s. holder’s
holding period, whichever is shorter, the distribution would be subject to taxation in the same
manner as described in the preceding paragraph. siemens ag believes it was not a pfic for its
504
most recent taxable year and does not expect to be a pfic for its current taxable year. however,
siemens ag has not analyzed or made any determination as to its pfic status for any recent
taxableyears.
u.s. holders should consult their tax advisers regarding siemens ag and the company’s pfic
status, and the application of the pfic rules to the spin-off and their ownership of the new
shares.
20.5 information reporting and backup withholding
the distribution of new shares in connection with the spin-off and payments of dividends and
sales proceeds, in each case, that are made within the united states or through certain u.s.-
related financial intermediaries generally are subject to information reporting, and may be
subject to backup withholding, unless (i) the u.s. holder is an exempt recipient or (ii) in the case
of backup withholding, the u.s. holder provides a correct taxpayer identification number and
certifiesthatitisnotsubjecttobackupwithholding.
the amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a u.s. holder will be allowed as a
credit against the holder’s u.s. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund,
providedthattherequiredinformationistimelyfurnishedtotheinternalrevenueservice.
certainu.s.holderswhoareindividuals(andcertainspecifiedentities)mayberequiredtoreport
information relating to their ownership of the new shares, or any non-u.s. accounts through
which the new shares are held. u.s. holders should consult their tax advisers regarding their
reportingobligationswithrespecttothenewshares.

for the nine months ended june 30, 2020
note 1 basis of presentation
the accompanying condensed combined interim financial statements should be read in
conjunction with siemens energy combined financial statements for the fiscal years ended
september30,2019,2018and2017.
purposeandcontentofthecondensedcombinedinterimfinancialstatements
on may 7, 2019, siemens aktiengesellschaft (“siemens ag”) announced its plans to publicly list
the siemens energy business (referred to hereafter as “siemens energy”) in the form of a
spin-off, by issuing siemens energy shares to shareholders of siemens ag and a subsequent
listing oftheseshares.siemensagplanstoretainaminoritystakeinsiemensenergy.theparent
companyofsiemensenergy,andthustheissuerofsharesforthespin-off,willbesiemensenergy
ag (until april 2, 2020: kyros 52 aktiengesellschaft) with registered office in munich (registry
number hrb 252581), germany. siemens energy ag (referred to hereafter as “the company”)
became economically active on april 1, 2020 (before this date and until spin-off the company
does not have any operating business). upon completion of the proposed transaction structure,
siemens energy ag will be the parent company of the future siemens energy group and will
directly hold 100% of the partnership interest of siemens gas and power gmbh & co. kg and
100% of the interest of siemens gas and power management gmbh, the sole general partner of
siemens gas and power gmbh & co. kg. siemens gas and power gmbh & co. kg was
incorporated in fiscal 2019 and will directly and indirectly hold shares in all siemens energy
companies.
siemens energy has been separated from siemens ag and its subsidiaries (“siemens group”) in
several steps. in an initial preparatory step, activities that had not been conducted by separate
companies have been or will be transferred to separate legal entities, either by carving out the
siemens energy businesses or in some countries (for example in brazil, norway and israel) by
carving out the businesses within the legal entities that remain with siemens group (reverse
carve-out). all activities that form the siemens energy business are thenplacedunderthecontrol
ofsiemensgasandpowergmbh&co.kg.
the transfer of the siemens energy business that has been bundled in and under siemens gas
and power gmbh & co. kg will be implemented in two steps. first, the participation held by
siemens beteiligungen inland gmbh (“sbi gmbh”) in siemens gas and power gmbh & co. kg
andaportionoftheparticipationheldbysiemensaginsiemensgasandpowergmbh&co.kg
as well as corresponding participations held in the siemens gas and power management gmbh
will be contributed to siemens energy ag by way of capital increases in kind. sbi gmbh and
siemens ag will each receive shares in siemens energy ag created by way of the capital increase
in return. to ensure value congruence between the shares being issued and the contribution,
siemens ag will also receive a cash payment. this was contractually agreed on may 22, 2020,
where siemens ag and sbi gmbh on the one side and siemens energy ag on the other side
enteredintoanotarizedcontributionagreement.
in a second step, siemens ag will spin off its remaining limited partnership interest in siemens
gas and power gmbh & co. kg and its remaining shares in the siemens gas and power
managementgmbhtosiemensenergyagbywayofaspin-offforabsorptionunderthegerman
transformationact(“umwandlungsgesetz”,“umwg”).
the siemens shareholders will receive siemens energy shares corresponding to their participation
in siemens ag. the shares required for this purpose will be created by an additional capital
increase in exchange for a contribution in kind of siemens energy ag. this was contractually
agreed on may 22, 2020, where siemens ag and siemens energy ag entered into a notarized
spin-off and transfer agreement, which was approved by the shareholders’ meeting of siemens
f-9
ag on july 9, 2020 and previously approved by the shareholders’ meeting of siemens energy ag.
siemens ag, acting as the sole shareholder of siemens energy ag, granted its consent to the
spin-off and transfer agreement at the shareholders’ meeting of siemens energy ag in may
2020. after the implementation of the spin-off, the siemens group together with the pension
fund, siemens pension-trust e.v., will hold 45% and the siemens shareholders will hold 55% of
thesharesinsiemensenergyag.
as regards the future participation of the siemens group in siemens energy ag, siemens ag, sbi
gmbh and siemens energy ag have entered into a deconsolidation agreement
(“entherrschungsvertrag”) in the context of the conclusion of the spin-off and transfer
agreement. the siemens energy business is to be conducted by siemens energy ag
autonomouslyandindependentlyofsiemensag.

item 18.1.1., supplementingregulation(eu) 2017/1129,anissuer must presenthistorical financial

para 1 in connection with article 18 para 3, siemens energy ag, as the issuer, has a “complex
financial history” as of the share issuance date and needs to prepare additional financial
information. therefore, in addition to the combined financial statements for the fiscal years
from october 1, 2018 to september 30, 2019, from october 1, 2017 to september 30, 2018 and

basisforcondensedcombinedinterimfinancialstatements
thesecondensedcombinedinterimfinancialstatementshavebeenpreparedinaccordancewith
international financial reporting standards (“ifrs”) applicable to interim financial reporting as
adopted by the european union (“eu”), and, in particular, for interim financial statements
according to international accounting standard (“ias”) 34, interim financial reporting. the
condensed combined interim financial statements apply the same accounting principles and
practices as those used in the combined financial statements as of september 30, 2019 with the
exception of ifrs 16, leases, and ifric 23, uncertainty over income tax treatments (refer to
recently adopted accounting pronouncements). results for the interim reporting are not
necessarily indicative for future results. in interim periods, tax expense is based on the current
estimatedannualeffectivetaxrateofsiemensenergy.
the condensed combined interim financial statements are prepared on a going concern and a
historical cost basis as included in the siemens ag consolidated financial statements, based on
the siemens ag date of transition to ifrs (october 1, 2004). since ifrs provides no guidelines for
the preparation of combined financial statements, rules given in ias 8.12 have been used.
ias8.12requires theconsideration ofthemost recentpronouncementsofotherstandard-setting
bodies, other financial requirements and recognized industry practices. following ias 8.12, the
predecessoraccountingapproachhasbeenappliedinthecondensedcombinedinterimfinancial
statements. duetotheclassification ofsiemensenergyasdiscontinuedoperationsatthelevelof
siemensag,theextractionapproachhasbeenadjustedfortheaccountingpoliciesandvaluation
methods applied when presenting siemens energy as a group of companies independent of
siemens ag. in particular, this includes the assessment of useful lives and impairments of assets
includinginvestmentsandassociatedcompaniesbysiemensenergymanagement.
exceptfor thecases statedabove,thesameaccountingpoliciesandmeasurementprinciples have
been applied in preparing the condensed combined interim financial statements as used by the
siemens energy entities and operations in preparing their financial information for inclusion in
thefinancialinformationasofjune30,2020publishedbysiemensag.
the condensed combined interim financial statements of siemens energy reflect the following
businesses:
(cid:129) thesegmentgasandpower(gp)1;
(cid:129) thesegmentsiemensgamesarenewableenergy(sgre).
with the exception of the stake in siemens ltd., india, these businesses have been presented as
discontinued operations starting from the half-year consolidated financial statements of
siemensagasofmarch31,2020.
for a list of legal entities that are included in the condensed combined interim financial
statements,refertoscopeofcombination.
the condensed combined interim financial statements for siemens energy are derived as
follows:
the financial information for the segment gp included in the condensed combined interim
financial statements is derived from the segment reporting of siemens group, before applying
the presentation and measurement principles of ifrs 5 for discontinued operations. thesegment
reporting included certain cost allocations for centrally managed functions prior to the legal
separation.
the financial information for the segment sgre included in the condensed combined interim
financial statements is derived from the segment reporting of siemens group, before applying

the financial information for the minority stake in siemens ltd., india is derived from the
siemensagifrsreportingpackageofthisentity.
in addition, in order to reflect the assets, liabilities, income and expenses that fall within the
scope of siemens energy, the following combination rules have been applied. the management
uses significant judgment in determining these combination rules. thus, the condensed
combined interim financial statements presented do not necessarily reflect the financial
position, cash flows or results of operations that would have occurred if siemens energy had
existedasaseparategroupintheperiodspresented.
scopeofcombination
the scope of combination for the condensed combined interim financial statements of siemens
energy for the nine months ended june 30, 2020 was determined on the principles of the legal
reorganization approach. this approach is based on the fact that the economic activities that
form the new group were not managed centrally in the past, but the entities are legally bound
together within a reorganization process. during the reporting periods of the condensed
combined interim financial statements, the assets and liabilities forming the reporting entity
wereundercommoncontrolofsiemensag.
the scope of combination includes companies and businesses that will be directly or indirectly
and fully or partially owned by siemens energy ag after the spin-off of the siemens energy
group has been completed. this includes entities that were controlled by siemens ag or its
subsidiaries during the reporting period of the condensed combined interim financial
statements and for which a legal transfer to siemens energy ag is planned. businesses in
accordance with ifrs 3 under common control that were transferred to siemens energy during
the legal reorganization are included with their respective assets and liabilities as well as income
and expenses in the condensed combined interim financial statements for all periods during
whichsiemensagcontrolledtheseentities.
for legal entities transferring to siemens energy that had already been fully dedicated to the
siemens energy business and for which no carve-out has been required, the condensed
combined interim financial statements also includes all non-business assets, liabilities, income
and expenses of the legal entity (mainly financing activities and real estate), with the exception
of a one-off fee amounting to €655 million paid by siemens energy to siemens group for the
early termination of a loan payable to siemens group, which occurred in the nine months ended
june 30, 2020 in connection with the preparation of siemens energy’s future capital structure.
since the corresponding external loan from a siemens group perspective was not impacted by
thisprematurerepayment,theprofitimpactwassubsequentlyeliminatedwithinequity.
for legal entities that required a legal separation, certain assets and liabilities or obligations
transferredtosiemensenergythathistoricallyhavenotbeenpartofthesiemensenergybusiness
are recognized in the condensed combined interim financial statements at the time of the
separation as further detailed below. balances related to the settlement of local purchase prices
of the siemens energy business still held by other siemens group companies as of june 30, 2020
havebeeneliminated.
goodwillallocation
the goodwill included in the condensed combined interim financial statements is based on the
goodwill attributable to the siemens energy business. the goodwill amount reflected in the
condensed combined interim financial statements comprises the goodwill attributable to the
segmentsgreasincludedinthesiemensgroupsegmentreportingaswellasgoodwillattributable
tothesegmentgpasreportedinthesiemensgroupsegmentreportingfortheoperatingcompany
gas and power which was allocated to the siemens energy business adjusted for legal entities
wherelegaltransferisnotplanned,basedonarelativevalueapproach.
the goodwill is allocated and to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever
there is an indication of impairment, at the level of groups of cash-generating units, represented
by the segment gp and for sgre one level below the segment. this is the lowest level at which
f-12
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. as of march 31, 2020, the
recoverability of goodwill was assessed in the process of the held for disposal classification atthe
levelofsiemensagandnoimpairmentwasrecorded.
servicesprovidedandchargedbycentrallymanagedfunctions
services provided by centrally managed functions from siemens group to siemens energy have
beenincludedinthecondensedcombinedinterimfinancialstatementsashistoricallychargedto
thebusiness.foremployeespreviouslyemployedbysuchcentrallymanagedfunctionsofsiemens
groupthathavebeentransferredtothesiemensenergybusinessinlinewiththereorganization,
employee-related expenses, assets and liabilities (including liabilities for pensions and similar
obligations) have been included in the condensed combined interim financial statements from
theoccurrenceofthetransfer.
pensionsandsimilarobligations
the condensed combined interim financial statements of siemens energy present the pension
obligationsofthesiemensenergypopulationandthecorrespondingplanassets.
the pension obligations for active employees, as well as for passives (with the exception of
germany), have been transferred mainly in line with the legal reorganization. therefore, the
majority of pension obligations has been transferred during fiscal year 2020. in countries where
the carve-out had not been completed as at june 30, 2020, the pension obligations and related
plan assets may change considering specific requirements when the separation into siemens
energylegalentitiesbecomeseffective.
in germany, the siemens group provides pension benefits through the following plans: bsav
(beitragsorientierte siemens altersversorgung), closed legacy plans and deferred compensation.
funding for such plans is currently provided via contractual trust arrangements (“ctas”). in
relation to siemens energy, siemens gas and power gmbh & co. kg has set up a cta which acts
asthepensiontrust(the“gptrust”)forgermanentities.siemensgasandpowergmbh&co.kg
acts as sole trustor for the bsavand the legacy plans, while for the deferredcompensationplans
the participating group entities are acting as trustor. this cta has been funded with assets that
had a fair value of approximately €915 million as at transfer date (january 2, 2020) and resulted
inanequivalentincreaseinsiemensenergy’spensionassetsfromthatdate.
before carve-out, plan assets have been allocated by taking into consideration specific legal
requirements for the major countries. where the respective employee has a right to claim a
minimal funding or the plan assets were already allocated to individual employee accounts, plan
assets have been retrospectively allocated to siemens energy for the periods prior to the legal
transferoftheassets.
incometaxes
income taxes, current and deferred income taxes are recognized for the purposes of the
condensed combined interim financial statements taking into consideration local tax
requirements. income taxes are determined using the separate tax return approach under the
assumption that the entities and operations of siemens energy constitute separate taxable
entities. in interim periods, tax expense is based on the current estimated annual effective tax
rateofsiemensenergy.
this assumption implies thatcurrentanddeferredtaxesforallcompaniesandoperationsandtax
groups within siemens energy are calculated separately. the recoverability of deferred tax assets
is assessed on this basis. in the condensed combined interim financial statements deferred tax
assets were recognized to the extent it is probable that they can be offset with future taxable
incomefromtherespectivesiemensenergyentities.
tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards of siemens
energy entities and operations that did not constitute a separate taxpayer were treated as
contributions or transfers from reserves by shareholders and are not included in the condensed
f-13
combined interim financial statements of siemens energy. the management of siemens energy
deems the approach as appropriate though not necessarily indicative of the tax expenses or
incomethatwouldresultforsiemensenergyasaseparategroup.
realestateassets
assets that were leased from siemens real estate and transferred to siemens energy as part of
the legal reorganization have been included in the condensed combined interim financial
statements when the separation into siemens energy legal entities became effective. before
transfer, the leases have been reflected as such in the condensed combined interim financial
statements. apart from the effect of the initial application of ifrs 16, these transfers of real
estate assets, including right-of-use assets, were the main driver for the increase of property,
plantandequipmentyear-over-year.
othercentrallymanageditems
othercentrallymanageditemshavebeenincludedinthecondensedcombinedinterimfinancial
statements from the occurrence of the legal transfer of each entity. until completion of the
carve-out, only business-related items as well as taxes are included in the condensed combined
interimfinancialstatements.
capitalstructure
the equity of siemens energy consists of the net assets attributable to siemens energy. the
condensed combined interim financial statements do not show any subscribed capital, because
siemensenergydoesnotconstitutealegalgroupduringtheperiodpresented.
the equity of siemens energy as presented in the condensed combined interim financial
statementshasbeenimpactedmainlybythefollowingcombinationrules:
a) any allocation of assets and liabilities to siemens energy in addition to those already
included in the segment reporting for the businesses as presented in the consolidated
financial statements of siemens ag was directly recognized in equity as withdrawal or
contributionatthetimeoftheallocation;
b) anyconsiderationgivenorreceivedinthecourseoftheformationofagroupofentitieswas
directlyrecognizedinequityaswithdrawalorcontributionatthetimeofthetransfer;
c) any taxes paid from siemens group and related to siemens energy operations prior to the
carve-out,wasdirectlyrecognizedinequity;
d) any changes in the conversion of receivables and payables to cash related to siemens energy
operationspriortothecarve-out,wasdirectlyrecognizedinequity;
category c) and d) was necessary because in the siemens ag consolidated financial statements
cash balances were not allocated to the siemens group operating segments but managed
centrally. additionally, in siemens group legal entities tax payments were not assigned to

ifrs 16, leases, was adopted as of october 1, 2019, by applying the modified retrospective
approach (using practical and transition-related expedients), i.e. comparative figures for the
preceding year are not adjusted. ifrs 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model requiring
lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than
twelvemonths,unlesstheunderlyingassetisoflowvalue.
as of september 30, 2019, finance leases totaled €39 million; thereof gp €37 million and sgre
€2 million. as of june 30, 2020, lease liabilities amounted to €1,204 million (october 1, 2019:
€896 million); thereof gp €598 million (october 1, 2019: €311 million) and sgre €606 million
(october1,2019:€585million).
f-14
as of october 1, 2019, right-of-use assets of €1,003 million were recognized in property, plant
and equipment, generally measured at the amount of the lease liability (in total: €896 million)
adjusted by any prepaid or accrued lease payments. most of the transition effect relates to real
estate leased by siemens energy. the difference between future payment obligations under
operating leases as of september 30, 2019 of €1,559 million and the gross lease liability as of
october 1, 2019 of €1,045 million mostly results from the application of transition-related
expedients. for leases between siemens real estate and siemens energy that were to be
transferred during fiscal 2020, no right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recognized prior to
thetransfer.
the future lease payments from leases under the right-of-use model as of october 1, 2019 were
discounted using incremental borrowing rates (weighted average incremental borrowing rate as
ofoctober1,2019:1.7%.)
on october 1, 2019, siemens energy retrospectively adopted ifric 23, uncertainty over income
tax treatments. the adoption had no material impact on the condensed combined interim
financialstatements.
coronaviruspandemic(covid-19)
in the nine months ended june 30, 2020, siemens energy’s business and economic environment
has been adversely affected by the pandemic covid-19 spread, though certain mitigating effects
may arise due to the various measures taken by governments or states globally, including
favorable financial support. as the outbreak continues to evolve, it is challenging to predict its
duration and its magnitude of impacts on assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows.
in the june 30, 2020 condensed combined interim financial statements, siemens energy
cautiously based financial information related estimates and assumptions on existing knowledge
andbestinformation available andappliedascenarioassumingthecurrentcovid-19situationis
of no long-term duration. covid-19-related impacts on siemens energy’s condensed combined
interim financial statements may inter alia result from interest rate adjustments in various
countries, increasing volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, deteriorating creditworthiness,
credit defaultordelayedpayments, delaysin orderplacements aswellasinexecutingordersand
contracts, termination of contracts, adjusted or modified revenue and cost patterns, limited
usage of assets, volatility in financial and commodity markets, limited or no access to customer
facilities and hardship in preparing predictions and forecasts due to uncertainties in amount and
timing of cash flows. those factors may impact fair value and carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities, amount and timing of results of operations and cash flows. it requires complex and
subjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are
inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. siemens energy believes assumptions applied
appropriately reflect the current situation. furthermore, accounting estimates are made in
determining the net realizable value of inventories taking into account quantity, technical and
price risk. with regard to goodwill the underlying assumptions used in the q2 2020 impairment
assessment described above were reviewed in q3 2020 and no changes were identified which
required impairment testing to be performed at june 30, 2020. the company believes
assumptions applied appropriately reflect the current situation. as regards specific singular

these shares. siemens ag plans to retain a minority stake in siemens energy. the parent company
of siemens energy and thus, the issuer of shares for the planned spin-off will be siemens energy

100%ofthesharesofsiemensgasandpowergmbh&co.kg.
siemens energy is separated from siemens ag and its subsidiaries (“siemens group”) in several
steps. in an initial preparatory step, activities that had not been conducted by separate
companies have been or will be transferred to separate legal entities, either by carving out the
siemens energy businesses or by carving out the businesses within the legal entities that remain
with siemens group (reverse carve-out). all activities that form the siemens energy business are
then placed under the control of siemens gas and power gmbh & co. kg. at the time of the
spin-off, siemens ag and siemens beteiligungen inland gmbh (“sbi”) will contribute their
respective stake in siemens gas and power gmbh & co. kg to siemens energy ag against shares
in siemens energy ag, of which siemens ag will spin-off a majority portion to the shareholders
ofsiemensagasafinalstep.

definitionofsiemensenergybusiness
siemens energy is one of the largest suppliers of technology in the energy and electricity sector
with an integrated setup that encompasses the entire scope of the energy market. it provides a
leading portfolio along the entire energy value chain – in both conventional and renewable
energy, supported by a complete set of training and service offerings. this comprehensive
portfolio supports public- and private-sector customers along the continuum of energy – from
powergenerationtopowertransmissionandtherelatedservicesbusinesses.
siemensenergy’soperationsinclude:
(cid:129) gas and power, which offers a broad spectrum of products and solutions for the generation of
energy, along the entire value chain in the oil and gas industry and the construction and
operationofpowertransmissionnetworks;
(cid:129) siemens gamesa renewable energy (sgre), which offers on- and offshore wind turbines as
wellasservicesthroughoutthewholelifecycleofwindturbines.
prior to the public listing of siemens energy, an internal reporting system has been established.
for the segment reporting in the combined financial statements, this system has been used
retrospectivelyandinlinewithifrs8.
combinedfinancialstatements
the combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international
financialreportingstandards(“ifrs”)asadoptedbytheeuropeanunion(“eu”).
since ifrs provides no guidelines for the preparation of combined financial statements, rules
given in ias 8.12 have been used. ias 8.12 requires the consideration of the most recent
pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial requirements and recognized
industry practices. following ias 8.12, the predecessor accounting approach has been applied in
thecombinedfinancialstatementsofsiemensenergy.
the same accounting policies and measurement principles have been applied in preparing the
combined financial statements as used by the siemens energy entities and operations in
preparing their financial information for inclusion in the ifrs consolidated financial statements
of siemens ag. accounting estimates originally used in the ifrs consolidated financial
statements of siemens ag have not been adjusted to reflect potential new knowledge before
beingincludedinthecombinedfinancialstatements.
the combined financial statements of siemens energy reflect the following businesses as
included in the ifrs consolidated financial statements of siemens ag for the fiscal year ended
september30,2019,adjustedforlegalentitieswherelegaltransferisnotplanned;
(cid:129) thesegmentgasandpower;
(cid:129) thesegmentsiemensgamesarenewableenergy;

(cid:129) thesubseabusiness;
(cid:129) thedistributiontransformerbusiness;
(cid:129) theat-equityinvestmentsinvoithhydroandethosenergy;
(cid:129) the 24% minority stake in siemens limited india, which is fully consolidated at siemens ag.
the treatment in the combined financial statements (24% share of historical book values) is
based on the current expectation ofboththemanagementofsiemens agandsiemens energy
that the sale of the minority stake in siemens limited india will be successfully completed
before spin-off. the agreement between siemens ag and siemens energy dated march 30,
2020, specifies that should the sale not be completed before spin-off, siemens ag may sell the
stake in steps over a period of years. consequently, accounting in the consolidated financial
statements after spin-off would follow the step-wise acquisition of the stake in siemens
limited,india.

before transfer to siemens energy that are included in the combined financial statements,
pleasealsorefertonote28–scopeofcombination.
thecombinedfinancialstatementsforsiemensenergyarederivedasfollows:
the financial information for the segment gas and power included in the combined financial
statements is derived from the segment reporting as presented in the consolidated financial
statements of siemens ag. this segment reporting included certain cost allocations for centrally
managedfunctionspriortothelegalseparation.
the financial information for sgre included in the combined financial statements is derived from
thesegmentreportingaspresentedintheconsolidatedfinancialstatementsofsiemensag.
the financial information for the process solutions business (excluding the minerals business),
subsea business and distribution transformer business included in the combined financial
statements is derived from the sub-segment reporting and local enterprise resource planning
(erp) systems. for selected items, the financial information is based on specific identification and
attributionorallocationofassets,liabilities,incomeandexpenses.
in addition, in order to reflect the assets, liabilities, income and expenses that fall within the
scope of siemens energy, the following combination rules have been applied. the management
(as defined in note 26 – related party transactions) uses significant judgment in determining
these combination rules. thus, the combined financial statements presented here do not
necessarily reflect the financial position and results of operations that would have occurred if
siemensenergyhadexistedasaseparategroupintheperiodspresented.
scopeofcombination
thescopeofcombinationforthecombinedfinancialstatementsofsiemensenergyforthefiscal
years ended september 30, 2019, september 30, 2018 and september 30, 2017 was determined
on the principles of the legal reorganization approach. this approach is based on the fact that
theeconomic activities thatform thenewgroupwerenotmanagedcentrallyinthepast,butthe
entities arelegally boundtogetherwithin areorganizationprocess. duringthereportingperiods
of the combined financial statements, the assets and liabilities forming the combination scope
wereundercommoncontrolofsiemensag.
the scope of combination includes companies and businesses that will be directly or indirectly
and fully or partially owned by siemens energy ag after the spin-off of the siemens energy
group has been completed. this includes entities that were controlled by siemens ag or its
subsidiaries during the reporting periods of the combined financial statements and for which a
legal transfer to siemens energy ag is planned. businesses in accordance with ifrs 3 under
common control that will be transferred to siemens energy during the legal reorganization are
included with their respective assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses in the
combinedfinancialstatementsforallperiodsduringwhichsiemensagcontrolledtheseentities.
for legal entities transferring to siemens energy that had already been fully dedicated to the
siemens energy business and for which no carve out has been required, the combined financial
statementsalsoincludeallnon-businessassets,liabilities,incomeandexpensesofthelegalentity
(mainly financing activities and real estate). for legal entities that required a legal separation,
certain assets and liabilities or obligations transferred to siemens energy that historically have
not been part of the siemens energy business are recognized in the combined financial
statementsatthetimeofthetransferasfurtherdetailedbelow.
goodwillallocation
the goodwill included in the combined financial statements is based on the goodwill attributable
to the siemens energy business. the goodwill amount reflected in the combined financial
statements comprises the goodwill attributable to the segment sgre as included in the siemens
group segment reporting, as well as goodwill attributable to the segment gas and power and to
the other businesses in scope, which was allocated to the siemens energy business adjusted for
legalentitieswherelegaltransferisnotplanned,basedonarelativevalueapproach.
f-56
during the periods presented, goodwill was allocated and tested based on the cash-generating
unit structure used at that time by siemens group to monitor goodwill as the siemens energy
reporting structure did not exist in the past. for further details please also refer to note 10 –
goodwill.
servicesprovidedandchargedbycentrallymanagedfunctions
services provided by centrally managed functions from siemens group to siemens energy have
been included in the combined financial statements for all periods presented as historically
chargedtothebusiness.foremployeespreviouslyemployedbysuchcentrallymanagedfunctions
of siemens group that have been transferred to the siemens energy business in line with the
reorganization, employee-related expenses, assets and liabilities (including liabilities for pensions
and similar obligations) have been included in the combined financial statements from the
occurrenceofthetransfer.
pensionsandsimilarobligations
the combined financial statements of siemens energy present the pension obligations of the
siemensenergypopulationandcorrespondingplanassets.
the pension obligations for active employees, as well as for passives, with the exception of
germany, are transferred mainly in line with the legal reorganization. therefore, the majority of
pension liabilities have been transferred during fiscal year 2020 prior to the listing of the shares.
pension obligations have retrospectively been allocated to siemens energy based on historical
employee lists for all periods presented in the combined financial statements. the pension
obligations may changein somecountries considering specific requirements whentheseparation
intosiemensenergylegalentitiesbecomeseffective.
plan assets have been allocated by taking into consideration specific legal requirements for the
major countries. where the respective employee has a right to claim a minimal funding or the
plan assets were already allocated to individual employee accounts, plan assets have been
retrospectively allocated to siemens energy for the periods prior to the legal transfer of the
assets. due to the fact that the legal transfer of these plan assets has not yet been completed,
theactualamountsoftheplanassetstobetransferredmaydifferfromtheplanassetspresented
inthecombinedfinancialstatements.forfurtherdetailspleasealsorefertonote14–provisions
forpensionsandsimilarobligations.
incometaxesanddeferredtaxes
inaccordancewithias12,“incometaxes”,currentanddeferredincometaxesarerecognizedfor
the purposes of the combined financial statements taking into consideration local tax
requirements. income taxes are determined using the separate tax return approach under the
assumption that the entities and operations of siemens energy constitute separate taxable
entities.
this assumption implies thatcurrentanddeferredtaxesforallcompaniesandoperationsandtax
groups within siemens energy are calculated separately. the recoverability of deferred tax assets
is assessed on this basis. in the combined financial statements deferred tax assets were
recognized to the extent it is probable that they can be offset with future taxable income from
therespectivesiemensenergyentities.
tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards of siemens
energyentitiesandoperationsthatdidnotconstituteaseparatetaxpayerinpreviousyearswere
treated as contributions or transfers from reserves by shareholders, and are not included in the
combinedfinancialstatementsofsiemensenergy.
management deems the approach as appropriate though not necessarily indicative of the tax
expenses or income that would result for siemens energy as a separate group. for further details

realestateassets
assets that were leased from siemens real estate and transferred to siemens energy as part of
the legal reorganization have been included in the combined financial statements when the
separation into siemens energy legal entities became effective. before legal transfer, the leases

note 2 material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates
the accounting principles set out below have, unless stated otherwise, been applied consistently
forallperiodspresentedinthesecombinedfinancialstatements.
key accounting estimates and judgments – certain of these accounting policies require
critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of
assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to
change. such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and have a
material impact on the results of operations, financial positions and cash flows of siemens
energy. critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where siemens energy
reasonably could have used a different estimate in the current accounting period. siemens
energy cautions that future events often vary from forecasts and that estimates routinely require
adjustment.
the estimates in accordance with the basis of preparation made in these combined financial
statements are consistent with estimates made for the same date in accordance with the
reporting requirements under ifrs as part of the consolidation group of siemens ag, unless
there is objective evidence that those estimates are not in accordance with ifrs on a stand-alone
basis. the areas involving a high degree of judgment and where estimates and assumptions are
significanttothecombinedfinancialstatementsaredisclosed.
businesscombinations –costofanacquisitionismeasuredatthefairvalueoftheassetsgiven
and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in a business combination (including contingent liabilities) are measured
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any
non-controlling interest. non-controlling interests are measured at the proportional fair value of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method). if there is no loss of control,
transactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity transactions not affecting
profit or loss. the non-controlling interests participate in profits and losses during the reporting
period.
associates – associates are companies over which siemens ag has the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies (generally through direct or indirect
ownership of 20% to 50% of the voting rights) and which are in scope of the siemens energy
business. these are recorded in the combined financial statements using the equity method and
areinitially recognizedatcost. siemens energy’s shareofits associate’s post-acquisition profitsor
losses is recognized in the combined statements of income, and its share of post-acquisition
changes in equity that have not been recognized in the associate’s profit or loss is recognized
directly in equity. the cumulative post-acquisition changes are adjusted against the carrying
amount of the investment in the associate. whensiemens energy’sshareoflosses in anassociate
equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, siemens energy does not recognize further losses,
unless it incurs obligations or makes payments on behalf of the associate. the interest in an
associate is the carrying amount of the investment in the associate together with any long-term
intereststhat,insubstance,formpartofsiemensenergy’snetinvestmentintheassociate.
joint ventures – joint ventures are entities over which siemens ag and one or more parties

foreign currency translation – assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the
functionalcurrencyisotherthantheeuro,aretranslatedusingthespotexchangerateattheend
of the reporting period, while the combined statements of income are translated using average
exchange rates during the period. differences arising from such translations are recognized
within equity and reclassified to net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreign
subsidiary is recognized. the combined statements of cash flow are translated at average
exchange rates during the period, whereas cash and cash equivalents are translated at the spot

foreign currency transaction – transactions that are denominated in a currency other than
the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at that functional currency applying the spot
exchange rate at the date when the underlying transactions are initially recognized. at the end
of the reporting period, foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are
revalued to functional currency applying the spot exchange rate prevailing at that date. gains
and losses arising from these foreign currency revaluations are recognized in net income. those
foreign currency-denominated transactions which are classified as non-monetary are remeasured
using the historical spot exchange rate. siemens energy applies hyperinflation accounting in
venezuela and argentina. the effect from the indexation of non-monetary balance sheet items
and income items amount to €(9) million in fiscal 2019 (fiscal 2018: €(57) million and fiscal 2017:
€(11) million). contrary effects on the net monetary position amounted to €8 million in fiscal
2019(fiscal2018:€43millionandfiscal2017:€15million).
revenue recognition – siemens energy recognizes revenue, when or as control over distinct
goods or services is transferred to the customer; i.e. when the customer is able to direct the use
of the transferred goods or services and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits,
provided a contract with enforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst others
collectability of consideration is probable taking into account customer’s creditworthiness.
revenue is the transaction price siemens energy expects to be entitled to. variable consideration
is included in the transaction price if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue
will not occur once associated uncertainties are resolved. the amount of variable consideration is
calculated by either using the expected value or the most likely amount depending on which is
expected to better predict the amount of variable consideration. consideration is adjusted for
the time value of money if the period between the transfer of goods or services and the receipt
of payment exceeds twelve months and there is a significant financing benefit either to the
customer or siemens energy. if a contract contains more than one distinct good or service, the
transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative stand-alone
selling prices. if stand-alone selling prices are not observable, siemens energy reasonably
estimates those. revenue is recognized for each performance obligation either at a point in time
orovertime.
sales from construction-type contracts: revenues are recognized over time under the
percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared
to total estimated costs. an expected loss on the contract is recognized as an expense
immediately. payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the
contractualterms.
the percentage-of-completion method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of
the extent of progress towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries
and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. these significant estimates
include total estimated costs, total estimated revenues, contract risks, including technical,
political and regulatory risks, and other judgments. under the percentage-of-completion
method, changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of revenue. in addition,
siemens energy needs to assess whether the contract is expected to continue or whether it is
terminated. in determining whether the continuation or termination of a contract is expected to
be the most likely scenario, all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the contract are
consideredonanindividualbasis.
revenues from services: revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the
performance pattern is other than straight-line, as services are provided, i.e. under the
percentage-of-completion method as described above. payment terms are usually 30 days from
thedateofinvoiceissuedaccordingtothecontractualterms.
sale of goods: revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to
the buyer, usually upon delivery of the goods. invoices are issued at that point in time and are
usuallypayablewithin30days.

functional costs – in general, operating expenses by types are assigned to the functions
following the functional area of the corresponding profit and cost centers. amortization,
depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are
includedinfunctionalcostsdependingontheuseoftheassets.
product-related expenses – provisions for estimated costs related to product warranties are
recordedinlineitemcostofsalesatthetimetherelatedsaleisrecognized.
research and development costs – costs of research activities are expensed as incurred. costs
of development activities are capitalized when the recognition criteria in ias 38 are met.
capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment
losseswithanamortizationperiodofgenerallythreetotenyears.
goodwill – goodwill is not amortized, instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as
well as whenever there are events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) which suggest
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated
impairment losses. the goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cash-generating
unit or a group of cash-generating units, generally represented by a segment. sgre is tested one
level below the segment. during the periods presented, goodwill was tested for impairment
based on the cash-generating unit structure used at that time by siemens group to monitor
goodwill as siemens energy and the new reporting structure did not exist in the past. for the
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the
cash-generating unit or the group of cash-generating units that is expected to benefit from the
synergies of the business combination. if the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit or the
group of cash-generating units, to which the goodwill is allocated, exceeds its recoverable
amount, an impairment loss on goodwill allocated to this cash-generating unit or this group of
cash-generatingunitsisrecognized.therecoverableamountisthehigherofthecash-generating
unit’s or the group of cash-generating units’ fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. if
either of these values exceeds the carrying amount, it is not always necessary to determine both
values. these values are generally determined based on discounted cash flow calculations.
impairmentlossesongoodwillarenotreversedinfutureperiods.
the determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-
generating units to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of estimates by management.
the outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced e.g. by the successful integration of
acquired entities, volatility of capital markets, interest rate developments, foreign exchange rate
fluctuations and the outlook on economic trends. in determining recoverable amounts,
discounted cash flow calculations use five-year projections that are based on financial forecasts.
cash flow projections take into account past experience and represent management’s best
estimate about future developments. cash flows after the planning period are extrapolated
using individual growth rates. key assumptions on which management has based its
determination of fair value less costs to sell and value in use include estimated growth rates and
weighted average cost of capital. these estimates, including the methodology used, can have a
materialimpactontherespectivevaluesandultimatelytheamountofanygoodwillimpairment.
other intangible assets – siemens energy amortizes intangible assets with finite useful lives on
astraight-line basisovertheirrespectiveestimatedusefullives. estimatedusefullivesforpatents,
licenses and other similar rights generally range from three to five years, except for intangible
assets with finite useful lives acquired in business combinations. intangible assets acquired in
business combinations primarily consist of customer relationships and trademarks as well as
technology. useful lives in specific acquisitions ranged from four to 20 years for customer
relationshipsandtrademarksandfromfiveto25yearsfortechnology.
f-61
property, plant and equipment – property, plant and equipment, is valued at cost less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. depreciation expense is recognized using the
straight-linemethod.thefollowingusefullivesareassumed:
factoryandofficebuildings .............................................. 20to50years
otherbuildings ......................................................... 5to10years
technicalmachinery&equipment ......................................... generally10years

impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets – siemens
energy reviews property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets for impairment
whenevereventsorchangesincircumstancesindicatethatthecarryingamountofanassetmaynot
be recoverable. in addition, intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to an annual
impairment test. impairment testing of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets
involves the use of estimates in determining the assets’ recoverable amount which can have a
materialimpactontherespectivevaluesandultimatelytheamountofanyimpairment.
non-current assets / liabilities held for disposal – non-current assets/liabilities are held for
disposal if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather
thanthroughcontinuinguse.
income taxes – tax positions under respective local tax laws and tax authorities’ views can be
complex and subject to different interpretations of tax payers and local tax authorities. different
interpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax reforms or other tax legislative
procedures may result in additional tax payments for prior years and are taken into account
based on management’s considerations. under the liability method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future taxable profit is available, including
income from forecasted operating earnings, the reversal of existing taxable temporary
differences and established tax planning opportunities. as of each period-end, siemens energy
evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets, generally based on five-years projected future
taxable profits. based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future
taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, siemens energy
believes it is probablesiemens energywill realize thebenefits ofthesedeductibledifferences.as
future developments are uncertain and partly beyond siemens energy’s control, assumptions are
necessary toestimate futuretaxableprofits aswell astheperiodin which deferredtaxassetswill
recover. estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the
assumption.
contract assets, contract liabilities, receivables – when either party to a contract with
customers has performed, siemens energy presents a contract asset, a contract liability or a
receivable depending on the relationship between siemens energy’s performance and the
customer’s payment. contract assets and liabilities are presented as current since incurred in the
normal operating cycle. receivables are recognized when the right to consideration becomes
unconditional. valuation allowances for credit risks are made for contract assets and receivables
inaccordancewiththeaccountingpolicyforfinancialassetsmeasuredatamortizedcost.
inventories – inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition or production costs and net
realizable value, costs being generally determined based on an average or first-in, first-out
method. net realizable value corresponds to the estimated selling price net of remaining costs of
completionandselling.
defined benefit plans – siemens energy measures the entitlements by applying the projected
unit credit method. the approach reflects an actuarially calculated net present value of the
future benefit entitlement for services already rendered. in determining the net present value of
the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered (defined benefit obligation
(“dbo”)), the expected rates of future salary increases and expected rates of future pension
f-62
progression are considered. the assumptions used for the calculation of the dbo as of the
period-end of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the calculation of service cost and
interest income and expense of the following year. starting in fiscal year 2018 significant plans
apply individual spot rates from full discount rate curves to determine service cost and interest
expense.thenetinterest income orexpensefor thefiscal yearwill bebasedonthediscountrate
for the respective year multiplied by the net defined benefit liability (asset) at the preceding
fiscalyear’speriod-enddate.
service cost, past service cost and settlement gains (losses) for pensions and similar obligations as
well as administration costs unrelated to the management of plan assets are allocated among
functional costs. past service cost and settlement gains (losses) are recognized immediately in
profitorloss.forunfundedplans,theamountofthelineitemprovisionsforpensionsandsimilar
obligations equals the dbo. for funded plans, siemens energy offsets the fair value of the plan
assets with the dbo. siemens energy recognizes the net amount, after adjustments for effects
relatingtoanyassetceiling.

actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, expected compensation
increases, rate of pension progression and mortality rates. discount rates used are determined by
reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at the
end of the reporting period. in case such yields are not available, discount rates are based on
government bonds yields. due to changing market, economic and social conditions, the
underlyingkeyassumptionsmaydifferfromactualdevelopments.
entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally
measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at period-end. if the performance of the
underlyingassets is lower thanaguaranteedreturn,thedbois measuredbyprojectingforward
thecontributionsattheguaranteedfixedreturnanddiscountingbacktoapresentvalue.
provisions – a provision is recognized in the statement of financial position when it is probable
that siemens energy has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of apastevent,it is
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. if the effect is material,
provisions are recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
pretaxratethatreflectscurrentmarketassessmentsofthetimevalueofmoney.whenacontract
becomesonerous,thepresentobligationunderthecontractisrecognizedasaprovision.
significant estimates are involved in the determination of provisions related to warranty costs,
onerous contracts, legal and regulatory proceedings as well as governmental investigations
(legal proceedings). the measurement of warranty provisions reflects whether the underlying
obligation results fromasingleobligationoralargerpopulationofitems. theamountsprovided
are based on best available information but may vary from actual claims. siemens energy records
a provision for onerous contracts with customers when current estimates of total estimated costs
exceed estimated revenue. onerous contracts with customers are identified by monitoring the
progress of the project and updating the estimates which requires significant judgment relating
to achieving certain performance standards as well as estimates involving warranty costs and
estimates regarding project delays including the assessment of responsibility splits between the
contractpartnersforthesedelays.
legal proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to substantial uncertainties.
accordingly, considerable judgment is part of determining whether it is probable that there is a
present obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the reporting period, whether it is
probable that such a legal proceeding will result in an outflow of resources and whether
the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. internal and external counsels are
generally part of the determination process. due to new developments, it may be necessary, to
record a provision for an ongoing legal proceeding or to adjust the amount of a previously
f-63
recognized provision. upon resolution of a legal proceeding, siemens energy may incur charges in
excess of the recorded provisions for such matters. the outcome of legal proceedings may have a
materialeffectonsiemensenergy’sfinancialposition,itsresultsofoperationsand/oritscashflows.
termination benefits – termination benefits are provided as a result of an entity’s offer made
in order to encourage voluntary redundancy before the regular retirement date or from an
entity’s decision to terminate the employment. termination benefits in accordance with ias 19,
employee benefits, are recognized as a liability and an expense when the entity can no longer
withdrawtheofferofthosebenefits.
financial instruments – a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset
of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. based on their
contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model they are held in, financial instruments
are classified as financial assets and financial liabilities measured at cost or amortized cost,
measured at fair value, loan commitments and credit guarantees and contract assets. regular way
purchases or sales of financial assets are accounted for at the trade date. siemens energy does not

derivative financial instruments – derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency
exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts are measured at fair value unless they are
designated as hedging instruments, for which hedge accounting is applied. changes in the fair
value of derivative financial instruments are recognized either in net income or, in the case of a
cash flow hedge, in line item other comprehensive income, net of income taxes (applicable
deferred income tax). certain derivative instruments embedded in host contracts are also
accountedforseparatelyasderivatives.
cash flow hedges – the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments
designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in line item other comprehensive income, net of
income taxes, and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income. amounts
accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedged

share-based payment – share-based payment awards at siemens energy are predominately
classified as cash-settled to fulfill the specific requirements for share-based payment transactions
among group entities. fair value is measured at grant date, updated each quarter and expensed
over the vesting period. fair value is determined as the market price of siemens ag shares,
considering dividends during the vesting period the grantees are not entitled to and market
conditionsandnon-vestingconditions,ifapplicable.
expenses related to share-based payment awards for siemens energy employees, which were
granted by a siemens group entity and for which the contractual obligation to settle the shared-
based payment liability has not been transferred to siemens energy as well as share-based
payments related to siemens gamesa shares, are included in the combined financial statements

recentlyadoptedaccountingpronouncements
ifrs 9, financial instruments, was adopted retrospectively as of october 1, 2018. fiscal 2018
information is measured under ias 39; amounts are not adjusted in accordance with ifrs 9
transitional provisions. the adoption had no material impact on the combined financial
statements. ifrs 9 changed the classification of financial instruments: equity instruments were
assessed on a case-by-case basis whether measurement at fvoci or fvtpl applies. debt
instruments not satisfying the solely paymentsofprincipal andinterest criterion were reclassified
fromloansandreceivablesandavailable-for-saletofvtpl.
in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, under ias 39, loans and receivables were measured at amortized
cost using the effective interest method less any impairment loss. available-for-sale financial
assets were measured at fair value, if reliably measurable, and changes in fair value other than
impairment losses were recognized in other comprehensive income, net of income taxes; upon
derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in equity were reclassified. if fair value was not
reliably measurable, available-for-sale assets were measured at cost. impairments were based on
theincurredlossmodel.

recentaccountingpronouncements,notyetadopted
the following pronouncements, issued by the iasb, are not yet effective and have not yet been
adoptedbysiemensenergy:
in january 2016, the iasb issued ifrs 16, leases. ifrs 16 eliminates the current classification
model for lessee’s lease contracts as either operating or finance leases and, instead, introduces a
single lessee accounting model requiring lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease
liabilities forleaseswithatermofmorethantwelvemonths.thisbringsthepreviousoff-balance
leases on the balance sheet in a manner largely comparable to current finance lease accounting.
ifrs 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after january 1, 2019. siemens energy will
adopt the standard for the fiscal year beginning as of october 1, 2019, by applying the modified
retrospective approach, i.e. comparative figures for the preceding year will not be adjusted. it is
intended to use most of the simplifications available under ifrs 16. currently, it is expected that
the majority of the transition effect relates to real estate leased by siemens energy. regarding
theadoptionofifrs16,leases,siemensenergyexpectsanincreaseofapproximately2%intotal
assets as well as in total liabilities and equity as of october 1, 2019 (opening balance sheet). in
addition, straight-line operating lease expenses will be replaced by depreciation expenses on
right-of-useassetsandinterestexpensesonleaseliabilities.
in may 2017, the iasb issued ifric 23, uncertainty over income tax treatments. the
interpretation clarifies therecognition andmeasurementrequirementswhenthereisuncertainty
over income tax treatments. in assessing the uncertainty, an entity shall consider whether it is
probable that a taxation authority will accept or revise the uncertain tax treatment. ifric 23 is
effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january 1, 2019, while earlier
application is permitted. siemens energy expects no material impact due to the adoption of
ifric23.
note 3 acquisition and disposals
acquisition
in april 2017, siemens ag contributed its wind power business, including service, into the
publicly listed company gamesa corporación tecnológica, s. a., spain (gamesa), and in return
received newly issued shares of the combined entity siemens gamesa renewable energy, s. a.,
spain (sgre). the two businesses are highly complementary regarding global footprint, existing
product portfolios and technologies. after the acquisition, siemens ag as majority shareholder
holds 59% of the shares of the combined entity, which are part of the combination scope of
siemens energy. as part of the merger, siemens ag paid €999 million in cash which was
distributed to the gamesa shareholders (without siemens ag) following the completion of the
merger.

managed in the interest of the beneficiaries. between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2019 the defined

benefit plans cover an average number of 52,000 participants, including 43,000 actives, 3,000
deferreds with vested benefits and 6,000 retirees and surviving dependents in around 50
countries.
where siemens energy employees participate in siemens group’s pension plans and the
respective pension trusts, siemens energy and siemens group bear the financial impact from
pension obligations related to the respective employees. as the majority of the siemens energy
pension liabilities derives from three major countries, the pension landscape in these three
countriesisdescribedindetailbelow.
germany:
in germany,pensionbenefitsareprovidedthrough thefollowingplans:bsav(beitragsorientierte
siemens altersversorgung), closed legacy plans which exclude future benefit increases as well as
deferred compensation plans. the majority of active employees participate in the bsav. those
benefits are predominantly based on notional contributions and their respective asset returns,
subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the employer. at inception of the bsav, benefits
provided under the legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects of
compensation increases. however, the legacy plans still expose siemens energy to investment risk,
interest rate risk and longevity risk. the pension plans are funded via contractual trust
arrangements(cta).ingermany,nolegalorregulatoryminimumfundingrequirementsapply.
for deferred compensation plans, plan assets have been allocated to siemens energy and are
therefore included in the numbers below. however, no plan assets have been allocated
to siemens energy for the bsav and the legacy plans. for further details please also refer to
note27–subsequentevent.
u.s.:
in the us, siemens energy currently participates in the defined benefit plans sponsored by
siemens corporation, which for the most part have been frozen to new entrants and to future
benefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts. the pension plans are
subject tothefundingrequirements undertheemployeeretirementincomesecurityactof1974
as amended, (erisa). there is a regulatory requirement to maintain a minimum funding level of
80% in defined benefit plans in order to avoid benefit restrictions. at its discretion, the
sponsoring employers may contribute in excess of this regulatory requirement. annual
contributions are calculated by independent actuaries. for all funded us pension plans, plan
assetshavebeenallocatedtosiemensenergy.
u.k.:
pension benefits are mainly offered through the va tech u.k. pension scheme. the scheme
provides benefits on retirement and death of its members and is closed to future accruals. the
required funding is determined by a funding valuation carried out every third year based on
legal requirements. from april 2013 the trustee arranged investments in insurance policies
covering pensions in payment due to members, which significantly reduced the longevity and

assetliabilitymatchingstrategies
a decline in the plans’ funded status due to adverse developments of plan assets and/or defined
benefit obligations resulting from changing parameters is considered a significant risk.
accordingly, a risk management concept aligned with the defined benefit obligations (asset
liability matching) was implemented. risk management is based on a worldwide defined risk
threshold (value at risk). the concept, the value at risk and the asset development including the
investment strategy are monitored and adjusted on an ongoing basis under consultation of
senior external experts. independent asset managers are selected based on quantitative and
qualitative analyses, which include their performance and risk evaluation. derivatives are used to

proceedingsoutoforinconnectionwithallegedbreachesofcontract
siemens ag is a member of a supplier consortium that has been contracted to construct the
nuclear power plant “olkiluoto 3” in finland for teollisuuden voima oyj (tvo) on a turnkey
basis. the agreed completion date for the nuclear power plant was april 30, 2009. siemens ag’s
share of the contract value is approximately 27%. the other member of the supplier consortium
is a further consortium consisting of areva np s.a.s. and its wholly owned subsidiary, areva
gmbh. completion of the power plant has been delayed for reasons which were in dispute. in
december 2008, the supplier consortium filed a request for arbitration against tvo demanding
an extension of the construction time, additional compensation, milestone payments, damages
and interest. tvo rejected the claims and asserted counterclaims against the supplier consortium
consisting primarily ofdamagesduetothedelay,lastupdatedtoapproximately€2.3billion. the
supplier consortium’s monetary claims as last updated amounted to approximately €3.6 billion.
the amounts claimed by the parties did not cover the total period of delay. in november 2016 a
partial award on certain preliminary questions identified for early treatment was issued. a
further partial award on document handling issues was rendered in july 2017. in this further
partial award certain key facts underlying the claims regarding delay and disruption that
occurred during project execution were decided in favor of tvo. another partial award on
project management issues and the use of advanced construction methods was rendered in
november 2017. while the tribunal granted some of tvo’s requests, most of tvo’s material
allegations in this respect were dismissed or their decision was deferred to a later stage. none of
the partial awards have dealt with the amounts claimed by the parties. a final arbitration award
on the merits of the claims and counterclaims was finally expected during the first half of
calendar year 2018. in march 2018, the supplier consortium, areva sa and tvo signed a global
settlement agreement which finally settled all claims and counterclaims raised in the arbitration
against a lump sum payment of €450 million by areva to tvo. in may 2018, the arbitral tribunal
declaredtheproceedingsclosed.
in march 2019, a brazilian company asserted claims to pay an amount in a higher three-digit
million euro amount in local currency against a consortium of contractors and each member of
the consortium, including siemens ltda., brazil (“siemens ltda.”) in a lawsuit relating to the
construction of a power plant in brazil that was completed in 2016. the members of the
consortium are jointly and severally liable, siemens ltda.’s share in the consortium is below 3%.

proceedingsoutoforinconnectionwithallegedcomplianceviolations
in september 2011, the israeli antitrust authority requested that siemens ag present its legal
position regarding an alleged anti-competitive arrangement between april 1988 and april 2004
in the field of gas-insulated switchgear. in september 2013, the israeli antitrust authority
concluded that siemens ag was a party to an illegal restrictive arrangement regarding the israeli
gas-insulated switchgear market between 1988 and 2004, with an interruption from october
1999tofebruary2002.thecompanyappealedagainstthisdecisioninmay2014.
based on the above mentioned conclusion of the israeli antitrust authority, two electricity
consumer groups filed motions to certify a class action for cartel damages against a number of
companies including siemens ag with an israeli state court in september 2013. one of the class
actions has been dismissed by the court in fiscal year 2015. the remaining class action seeks
compensation for alleged damages amounting to ils 2.8 billion (september 30, 2019:
€739 million, september 30, 2018: €665 million, september 30, 2017: €673 million). in addition,
the israel electric corporation (iec) filed at the end of december 2013 with an israeli state court
a separate ils 3.8 billion (september 30, 2019: €997 million, september 30, 2018: €897 million,
september 30, 2017: €909 million) claim for damages against siemens ag and other companies
that allegedly formed a cartel in the israeli gas-insulated switchgear market. a settlement
agreement concluded in december 2018 has been approved by the israeli court. this decision by
theisraelicourtissubjecttoappeal.
since 2006, the administrative council for economic defense (cade) in brazil conducted
investigations into possible antitrust behavior in the field of gas-insulated and air-insulated
switchgear from the 1990’s to 2006. siemens cooperated with the authorities. in february 2017,
siemens ag entered into a settlement agreement with cade relating to alleged antitrust
violationsinthefieldofgas-insulatedswitchgearforanamountinalowsingle-digiteuromillion
range. in october 2017, siemens ltda. entered into a settlement agreement with cade relating
to alleged antitrust violations in the field of air-insulated switchgear for an amount in a mid
double-digiteuromillionrange.
siemens received credible information in 2017 that four gas turbines intended for a project in
taman, russia, which were delivered by ooo siemens gas turbines technologies (sgtt) to its
customer oao vo technopromexport in summer of 2016 had been allegedly brought to crimea
against contractual agreements with sgtt. allegedly, these four gas turbines had been sold by
oao vo technopromexport to ooo vo technopromexport, had then been locally modified and
moved to crimea, a location under sanctions. siemens ag together with sgtt and sgtt
separately have filed lawsuits before the state court of moscow against oao vo
technopromexport and ooo vo technopromexport for the return of the gas turbines. the state
court of moscow rejected the claims of siemens ag and sgtt in both proceedings in four
instances.
additionally, the hamburg public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against siemens
employees in regard of alleged violations of the german foreign trade and payments act.

note 20 derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
to hedge foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks, derivatives are contracted to achieve
a 1:1 hedge ratio so that the main characteristics match the underlying hedged items (e.g.
nominal amount, maturity) in a critical term match, which ensures an economic relationship

risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency denominated receivables, payables, debt,
firm commitments and forecast transactions were centrally managed by siemens corporate
treasuryofsiemensaginfavorofsiemensenergy.
under this approach the risks are aggregated centrally, and various derivative financial
instruments, primarily foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and options,
are utilized to minimize such risks. such a strategy does not qualify for hedge accounting

project-relatedcashflowhedge
siemens energy applies cash flow hedge accounting to hedge the interest rate risk of a
forecasted sale of receivables that will originate from an infrastructure project in the u.s. the
project, in which siemens energy participates together with siemens group segment smart
infrastructure, schedules the origination of long-term receivables with a gross amount of
€344 million and maturities between 2 and 22 years after pac in 2022. siemens energy will
externally sell these receivables in 2022 shortly after their origination and hedges the discount
that will be charged by the external purchaser with a forward-starting interest rate swap. the
forward-starting interest rate swap fixes the applicable discount rate of the forecasted sale of
receivablesto2.2787%.

achieve its aims, siemens energy identifies, analyzes and manages the associated market risks.
siemens energy seeks to manage and control these risks primarily through its regular operating

in order to quantify market risks siemens energy utilized a system based on value at risk

many siemens energy units are located outside the eurozone. because the financial reporting
currency of siemens energy is the euro, the financial statements of these subsidiaries are
translated into euro for the preparation of the combined financial statements. to consider the
effects of foreign currency translation in the risk management, the general assumption is that
investments in foreign-based operations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous.

interestraterisk
interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. this risk arises whenever interest terms of
financial assets and liabilities are different. siemens energy’s exposure to the risk of changes in
market interest rates relates in most parts to financial investments and borrowings to siemens
groupviasiemenstreasury,mainlywithfixedratesofinterest.long-termliabilitiesmainlyrelate
to loans with siemens treasury (except sgre business). sgre mainly uses external sources to
financepartsofitsoperations,witheitherfixedorvariableinterestrates.
siemens energy (except sgre business) is mainly financed by siemens treasury and interest rate
risk management is performed at the level of siemens group. consequently, until the end of
fiscal 2019, siemens energy (except sgre business) did not manage its interest rate risk actively.
sgre continuously analyses the split of external financing at variable and fixed rates to optimize
itsinterestrateriskexposure.
siemens energy also uses derivative financial instruments to perform a comprehensive interest

as of september 30, 2019, the var relating to the interest rate was €157 million (september 30,

liquidity risk results from siemens energy’s inability to meet its financial liabilities. in the periods
presented, siemens energy was largely financed by siemens group and invested excess liquidity
using siemens group’s cash pooling and cash management systems. siemens energy mitigates

creditrisk
credit risk is defined as an unexpected loss in financial instruments if the contractual partner is
failingtodischargeitsobligationsinfullandontimeorifthevalueofcollateraldeclines.
the effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and ratings is a
core competency of siemens energy’s risk management system. in this context, siemens energy is
boundtothecreditpolicyimplementedbysiemensgroup.
f-93
siemens group maintains a credit risk intelligence unit to which numerous operating units of
siemens energy regularly transfer business partner data as a basis for a centralized rating and
credit limit recommendation process. due to the identification, quantification and active
managementofcreditrisks,creditrisktransparencyisincreased.
ratings and individually defined credit limits are based on generally accepted rating
methodologies, with information obtainedfromcustomers, externalratingagencies,dataservice
providers and credit default experiences. the ratings used consider appropriate forward-looking
information significant to the specific financial instrument like expected changes in the obligor’s
financial position, shareholders, management or operational risks, as well as broader forward-
looking information, such as expected macroeconomic, industry-related and competitive
developments. a country-specific risk component derived from external country credit ratings is
alsoconsidered.
an exposure is considered defaulted if the obligor is unwilling or unable to pay its credit
obligations. a range of internally defined events trigger a default rating, including the opening
of bankruptcy proceedings, receivables due past 90 days or a default rating by an external rating
agency.
to analyze and monitor credit risks, siemens energy applies various systems and processes. a
main element is a central it application that processes data from operating units together with
rating and default information and calculates an estimate which may be used as a basis for
individual bad debt provisions. additionally, qualitative information is considered, to particularly
incorporatelatestdevelopments.
the carrying amount is the maximum exposure to afinancial assets’ credit risk. collateral reduces
the valuation allowance to the extent it mitigates credit risk. collateral needs to be specific,
identifiableandlegallyenforceabletobetakenintoaccount.
as of september 30, 2019, collateral of €97 million (september 30, 2018: €67 million,
september 30, 2017: €35 million) relate to financial assets measured at fair value. those
collaterals are provided in connection with netting agreements for derivatives providing
protection from the risk of a counterparty’s insolvency. as of september 30, 2019, collateral held
for financial assets measured at amortized cost are €333 million (september 30, 2018:

note 22 share-based payments
share-based payment awards may be settled in newly issued shares of capital stock of siemens
ag, in treasury shares or in cash. share-based payment awards may forfeit if the employment of
the beneficiary terminates prior to the expiration of the vesting period. at siemens group level,
these share-based payment plans are predominantly designed and accounted for as equity-
settledplansandtoalimitedextentascash-settledplans.
in the combined financial statements of siemens energy, the classification of share-based
payment plans has been adjusted to fulfill the specific requirements for share-based payment
transactions among group entities. in most cases, siemens energy carries the contractual
obligation againstits employeestosettletheshare-basedpaymenttransactionsattheendofthe
vesting period. consequently, siemens energy accounts for these share-based payment plans as
cash-settledplans.
f-94
the carrying amount of liabilities from share-based payment transactions, included in the line
item other liabilities and other current liabilities in the combined financial statements, is
€100 million as of september 30, 2019 (september 30, 2018: €118 million, september 30, 2017:
€185 million). total pretax expense for share-based payment amounted to €44 million for the
year ended september 30, 2019 (september 30, 2018: €87 million, september 30, 2017:
€129million).
for information on share-based payments to related individuals refer to note 26 – related party
transaction.
stockawards
siemens energy grants stock awards to members of the senior management, and other eligible
employees. stock awards are subject to a restriction period of about four years and entitle the
beneficiary to receive siemens ag shares without payment of consideration following the
restrictionperiod.
stockawardsaretiedtoperformancecriteriaofsiemensag.theannualtargetamountforstock
awards can be bound to the average of earnings per share (eps, basic) of the past three fiscal
years and/or to the share price performance of siemens ag relative to the share price
performance of five important competitors (spac) during the four-year restriction period. the
target attainment for the performance criteria spac ranges between 0% and 200%. for awards
granted in fiscal 2019 settlement is in shares only corresponding to the actual target attainment.
for awards granted prior to fiscal 2019, target outperformances in excess of 100% are settled in
cash,targetattainmentsupto100%aresettledinshares.thevestingperiodisfouryearsandfor
awardsgranteduntilfiscal2014,fiveyears.
in fiscal 2019, 729,417 stock awards were granted contingent upon attaining the prospective
performance-based target of siemens ag stock relative to five competitors (fiscal 2018: 315,691
stock awards, fiscal 2017: 361,746 stock awards). the fair value of these stock awards amounting
to €33 million in fiscal 2019 (fiscal 2018: €23 million, fiscal 2017: €24 million), was calculated by
applying a valuation model. in fiscal 2019 inputs to that model include an expected weighted
volatility of siemens ag shares of 21.73% (fiscal 2018: 22.17%, fiscal 2017: 22.79%) and a market
price of €98.92 per siemens ag share (fiscal 2018: €114.80, fiscal 2017: €107.95). expected
volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities. the model applies a risk-free
interest rate of up to 0.16% in fiscal 2019 (fiscal 2018: up to 0.05%, fiscal 2017: up to 0.03%) and
an expected dividend yield of 3.84% in fiscal 2019 (fiscal 2018: 3.23%, fiscal 2017: 3.33%).
assumptions concerning share price correlations were determined by reference to historic
correlations.

interest expenses on payables to suppliers. financing interest is excluded from adjusted ebita
becausedecision-makingregardingfinancingistypicallymadeatthecorporatelevel.
decisions on essential pension items are made centrally. accordingly, adjusted ebita primarily
includes amounts related to service cost of pension plans only, while all other regularly recurring
pension related costs are included in reconciliations in line item centrally carried pension
expense.
income taxes are excluded from adjusted ebita since income tax is subject to legal structures,
which typically do not correspond to the structure of the segments. costs for support functions
areprimarilyallocatedtothesegments.

note 27 subsequent events
carve-outprocess
in the period after the reporting date but prior to the issuance of the combined financial
statements, activities that had not been conducted by separate companies have beentransferred
to separate legal entities either by carving out the siemens energy businesses or by carving out
thebusinesseswithinthelegalentitiesthatremainwithsiemensgroup(reversecarve-out). asof
the issuance of the combined financial statements, the carve-out process has been completed in
allcountriesexceptforbangladesh,egypt,japan,kuwait,qatarandsaudi-arabia.
transferofrealestateassetsandothercentrallymanageditems
certain assets and centrally managed items (mainly real estate previously leased by siemens
energy from siemens real estate and reflected as such in the combined financial statements)
have been transferred to siemens energy in line with the legal reorganization. management
expects that the total book value of real estate assets transferred to siemens energy after the
reportinguponcompletionofallcarveoutswillamounttoamidthree-digitmillioneurofigure.
deferredtaxes
in several countries, the legal carve out triggered taxable income on capital gains if the local
purchasepriceexceededthebookvalueofthesiemensenergybusiness.inlinewiththeseparate
tax return approach, no income tax expense will be shown in the combinedfinancial statements
for fiscal 2020 for these transactions. however, management expects that the change of the
related assets and liabilities’ tax base and related temporary differences following carve out will
lead to an increase in deferred tax assets of siemens energy by a low to mid three-digit million
eurofigure.
legalproceedingsinreversecarve-outcountries
insomecountries,theseparationofsiemensenergyfromsiemensgroupwasexecutedbywayof
a reverse carve-out, i.e. the businesses within a regional company that shall remain with siemens
group were transferred out of such a regional company into a newly established siemens group
legalentity.
as a result, legal proceedings against such regional company arising in connection with business
activities that were previously conducted by such regional company and that do not pertain to
the energy business will remain with such regional company, which is now part of siemens
energy. siemens energy and siemens group have reached agreements to allocate the resulting
financial risks in accordance with the separation of the business activities. however, it cannot be
excluded at this stage that, as a result of those legal proceedings, such regional company might
also be (temporarily or permanently) barred from conducting certain or any business in the
respectiveregion,orevenbedissolved.
these statements also apply to legal proceedings in brazil, inter alia resulting out of siemens’
businesses transferred into newly established siemens group legal entities (such as siemens
infraestrutura e indústria ltda., siemens mobility ltda., siemens healthcare diagnósticos s.a.).
these legal proceedings remain with siemens energy’s subsidiary in brazil and include among
othersthefollowinglegalproceedings:
in may 2013, siemens ltda., brazil (“siemens ltda.”) entered into a leniency agreement with the
administrative council for economic defense (cade) and other relevant brazilian authorities
relating to possible antitrust violations in connection with alleged anticompetitive irregularities
in metro and urban train projects, in which siemens ltda. and partially siemens ag, as well as a
number of other companies participated as contractor. in july 2019, cade completed the
administrative proceedings which started in may 2014, confirming the reported misconduct. due
to its cooperation, siemens was granted full immunity from administrative fines for the
misconduct. in connection with the above mentioned metro and urban train projects, several
f-106
brazilian authorities continue to investigate alleged criminal acts (corruptive payments, anti-
competitiveconduct,undueinfluenceonpublictenders).
in march 2014, siemens was informed that in connection with the above mentioned metro and
urban train projects the public prosecutor’s office são paulo requested to initiate criminal
proceedings as regards alleged violations of brazilian antitrust law against a number of
individualsincludingcurrentandformersiemensemployees.theproceedingsarecontinuing;the
public prosecutor’s office são paulo has appealed all decisions where the courts denied opening
criminaltrials.
in may 2014, the public affairs office (ministério público) são paulo initiated a lawsuit against
siemens ltda. as well as other companies and several individuals claiming, inter alia, damages in
an amount of brl 2.5 billion (september 30, 2019: €552 million, september 30, 2018:
€537 million, september 30, 2017: €665 million) plus adjustments for inflation and related
interest in relation to train refurbishment contracts entered into between 2008 and 2011. in
january 2015, the district court of são paulo admitted a lawsuit of the state of são paulo and
two customers against siemens ltda., siemens ag and other companies and individuals claiming
damages in an unspecified amount. in march 2015, the district court of são paulo admitted a
lawsuit ofthepublicaffairsoffice(ministériopúblico)sãopauloagainstsiemensltda.andother
companies claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of brl 487 million (september 30, 2019:
€108 million, september 30, 2018: €105 million, september 30, 2017: €130 million) plus
adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train maintenance contracts entered
into in 2000 and 2002. in september 2015, the district court of são paulo admitted another
lawsuit ofthepublicaffairsoffice(ministériopúblico)sãopauloagainstsiemensltda.andother
companies claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of brl 918 million (september 30, 2019:
€203 million, september 30, 2018: €197 million, september 30, 2017: €244 million) plus
adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train maintenance contracts entered
into in 2006 and 2007. siemens is defending itself against these actions. it cannot be excluded
thatfurthersignificantdamageclaimswillbebroughtbycustomersorthestateagainstsiemens.
injune2015,siemensltda.appealedtothesupremecourtagainstadecisionofapreviouscourt
to suspend siemens ltda. from participating in public tenders and signing contracts with public
administrations in brazil for afive yearterm basedonallegedirregularities in calendaryear1999
and 2004 in public tenders with the brazilian postal authority. in july 2015, the court suspended
enforcement of the debarment decision. in february 2018, the appeal of siemens ltda. was
rejected. siemens ltda. has introduced another remedy against the decision. in june 2018, the
court accepted siemens’ appeal and declared the earlier instance decision as void. in february
2018, the public affairs office (ministério público) brasilia filed a lawsuit based on the same set
of alleged irregularities in calendar years 1999 and 2004 in public tenders with the brazilian
postal authority, mainly claiming the exclusion of siemens ltda. from public tenders for a ten
year term. siemens ltda. is defending itself against the lawsuit. siemens ltda. is currently not
excludedfromparticipatinginpublictenders.
changesinpension-relatedassetsandliabilities
in most countries siemens energy employees historically participated in the siemens group
pension plans. for these plans, pension benefits are administered by the siemens group, but the
assets and liabilities are separated for each legal entity. as a result of the carve-out, most of the
plan assets and obligations relating to siemens energy’s employees have been transferred to
separatesiemensenergyentitiesandpensionplansandpensiontrustshaveorwillbetransferred
tosiemensenergypriortospin-off.
in germany, the siemens group provides pension benefits through the following plans: bsav
(beitragsorientierte siemens altersversorgung), closed legacy plans and deferred compensation.
funding for such plans is currently provided via contractual trust arrangements (“ctas”). in
relation to siemens energy, siemens gas & power gmbh & co. kg has set up a cta which acts as
the pension trust (the “gp trust”) for siemens energy’s german entities. siemens gas & power
gmbh & co. kg acts as sole trustor for the bsav and the legacy plans, while for the deferred
f-107
compensation plans the participating group entities are acting as trustor. for the bsav and the
legacy plans this cta has been funded with assets that had a fair value of approximately
€915 million as at transfer date (january 2, 2020) and resulted in an equivalent increase in
siemensenergy’splanassetsfromthatdate.
formationandfuturefundingofthesiemensenergygroup
in the period after the reporting date but prior to the issuance of the combined financial
statements, further transactions have occurred in connection with the formation as well as
future funding of the siemens energy group. the process is materially completed as of the
issuancedateofthecombinedfinancialstatements.
in may 2015, siemens group provided a usd loan to its subsidiary dresser rand group inc.
maturing in may 2045 to finance the acquisition of dresser rand – partially reimbursed in fiscal
2019. for further details please also refer to note 26 – related party transactions. in the context
of the future funding, the remainder amounting to €1,571 million has been terminated in
february2020.theterminationdidnothaveanimpactontheincomestatement.

sgre’scompetitivepositionineurope.
acquisitionofiberdrola’sstakeinsgre
in february 2020, siemens ag acquired iberdrola s.a.’s 8.1% stake in sgre. consequently,
siemens energy will hold about 67% of the voting rights at sgre after completion of the
formationofthesiemensenergygroup.
coronavirus(corona)
siemens energy’s business and economic environment is adversely affected by the pandemic
coronavirus spread, though certain mitigating effects may arise due to the various measures
taken by governments or states globally, including favorable financial support. as the outbreak
continues to evolve, it is challenging to predict its duration and its magnitude of impacts on
assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows. siemens energy’s evaluation is based on
existing knowledge and best information available and the assumption that the current
coronavirussituationisofnolong-termduration.coronarelatedimpactsonsiemensenergymay

if the eu and the u.k. fail to conclude a trading framework which provides for trading terms

22.1 recent developments
on july 2, 2020, s&p global assigned a preliminary long-term investment grade rating of bbb
withastableoutlooktosiemensenergy.onthesameday,s&pglobalannouncedthattherating
of sgre is foreseen to be upgraded to bbb upon spin-off completion. further, on august 6,
2020, s&p global assigned a preliminary long-term investment grade rating of bbb with a stable
outlook to se global gmbh & co. kg. after spin-off completion, the preliminary long-term
ratings are expected to become the long-term issuer credit ratings of siemens energy ag and se
globalgmbh&co.kg.
on july 7, 2020, siemens energy concluded the facility agreement regarding a revolving credit
facility with a maximum total volume of € 3 billion (see “12.9.1 siemens energy facility
agreement”).
on july 22, 2020, the ordinary general meeting of shareholders of sgre, s.a. ratified the
appointment of the sgre’s ceo, andreas nauen. this meeting also passed a motion to reduce
the size of the board of directors from 13 to 10 directors. on july 30, 2020, sgre announced the
appointmentofbeatrizpuenteasitsincumbentchieffinancialofficer.
on september 1, 2020, we announced a restructuring of our gas and power segment’s le havre
facilities. the current plan foresees a headcount reduction of approximately 300, the closure of
production activities while keeping certain operations. we estimate to incur personnel and non-
personnel costs of € 70 million to € 100 million associated with the transformation measures.
theannouncedplanisstillsubjecttochange,especiallyfollowingtheoutcomeofthejuststarted
negotiationsasperstatutoryrequirements.
on september 1, 2020, the increase of the company’s share capital from € 100,000 by
€ 326,890,337 to € 326,990,337 became effective. furthermore, the company expects that on
september 25, 2020 the increase of its share capital from € 326,990,337 by € 399,654,856 to
€ 726,645,193 by issuing the 399,654,856 new shares will become effective. for more
information, see “16.2 development of the share capital over the last three years and in the
courseofthespin-off”.
increasing costs for project-related guarantees, primarily for guarantees issued by siemens ag,
areexpectedtoresult in acumulative catch-up effect thatwill negativelyimpactourprofitability
inthefourthquarterofthefiscalyear2020with€75millionto€125million.
inthefourthquarterofthefiscalyear2020,wefurtherexpect:
(cid:129) our gas and power segment to recognize extraordinary expenses of up to € 50 million
predominantly due to write-offs and supplier related contracts, which were a consequence of
our strategic portfolio decision to streamline our offering of aero-derivative gas turbines with
a view to increasing profitability in this field of business (see “12.3.3 industrial applications
division”);and
(cid:129) oursgresegmenttorecognizespecialitemsof€75millionto€125million.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we expect to incur stand-alone costs of € 75 million to
€ 100 million (for information regarding stand-alone costs incurred in the nine-month period
endedjune30,2020,see“9.4.10.3specialitems”).
most of our businesses continue to be negatively impacted by the deteriorated business
environment due to covid-19 and/or low oil price levels. in our gas and power segment, the
effects varied widely. our gas and power segment’s transmission division experiencedanegative
impact mainly due to covid-19 and oil price developments causing postponements of single
large orders as well as an intermediate reduction of production capacities at transmission
factories. further, construction at some project sites was slowed down as travel restrictions and
lock-down situations made site access difficult in some countries. our gas and power segment’s
generation division experienced a negative impact mainly due to covid-19 caused by
o-1
postponements of orders due to project and service outage shifts. furthermore, due to
construction site closures the division incurred prolongation costs. our gas and power segment’s
industrial applications division experienced a negative impact mainly due to covid-19 and oil
price developments causingdelaysin contract negotiations resulting in postponementsoforders,
lower transactional business and service outage shifts due to travel restrictions. the industrial
applications division experienced only a limited impact on its manufacturing facilities as the
majority of its production sites remained open and operational. our sgre segment’s business
continuestobenegativelyimpactedmainlybytheeffectsofcovid-19,challengesintheonshore

except as described above, between june 30, 2020 and the date of the prospectus, there have
beennosignificantchangesinourfinancialposition.
22.2 outlook
immediately after the listing, siemens energy ag will implement a share repurchase program as
part of which it may buy back shares for up to € 393 million, but not more than 72,664,519
shares, until march 31, 2021. depending on prevailing trading volumes and conditions, siemens
energy ag intends to repurchase a substantial part of the volume at the beginning of the
repurchaseperiod.formoreinformation,see“17.6.1.2.4(3)sharebuybackprogram”.
uponspin-off completion, stockentitlements ofbeneficiaries ofthesiemens energygroupwho
leave the siemens group as a direct consequence of the spin-off will be forfeited and such
beneficiaries are entitled to cash compensation. as of august 26, 2020, we expect that the net
cash outflow for the cash compensation to be paid by siemens energy group will amount to
approximately € 229 million, with a lower impact expected on special items since the vested
portion is already reflected in the balance sheet. for more information, see “17.2.3.5 treatment
ofsiemensentitlementsafterthespin-offcompletion”.
wecurrentlyexpect:
(cid:129) our group’s adjusted ebita margin before special items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to

for the fiscal year 2023, we target our adjusted ebita margin before special items in a range
from 6.5% to 8.5%. for the fiscal year 2023, we target adjusted ebita margin before special
items for our gas and power segment in a range from 6% to 8% and for our sgre segment in a
rangefrom8%to10%.
in the mid-term, we target an adjusted ebita margin of at least 8% and our revenue to grow
over a rolling three year average in a range from 0% to 3% (excluding portfolio and currency
effects).

in setting our targets for fiscal year 2023 and our mid-term targets we have assumed, among
otherthings:
(cid:129) market trends to materialize as described in “11 industry overview”, including an impact of
covid-19 on market developments not exceeding the magnitude as outlined therein, no
second wave of covid-19 or a significant prolongation of the current pandemic leading to
comprehensive lockdown measures as experienced in the first half of 2020. further, we assume
a recovery of a part of the negative impact of covid-19 on our business experienced in the
fiscal year 2020 by the fiscal year 2023, with first recoveries in our gas and power segment’s
transmission and generation divisions already in the fiscal year 2021, as well as a recovery of
oil prices to pre-covid-19 levels in the mid-term to around usd 65-70 bbl and an overall
positive impact from the trend towards decarbonization which is expected to benefit our
