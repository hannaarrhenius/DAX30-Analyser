principal activities
general
  linde plc is a public limited company formed under the laws of ireland with its principal offices in the united kingdom.  linde 
plc was formed in 2017 in accordance with the requirements of the business combination agreement, dated 1 june 2017, as amended, 
between linde plc, praxair, inc. ("praxair") and linde aktiengesellschaft ("linde ag").  effective 31 october 2018, the business 
combination was completed and linde plc is comprised of the businesses of praxair and linde ag (hereinafter the combined businesses 
will be referred to as "the company" or "linde").
  although the business combination has been completed, as of 31 december 2018 the companies still needed to finalize the 
divestitures required by the respective antitrust authorities. as of 31 december 2018 and until the completion of the majority of such 
divestitures, linde ag and praxair were obligated to operate their businesses globally as separate and independent companies, and not 
coordinate any of their commercial operations (hold separate order (“hso”)). these restrictions were lifted 1 march 2019, concurrent 
with the sale of the required merger-related divestitures in the united states.
  the business combination brought together two leading companies in the global industrial gases industry, leveraging the proven 
strengths of each.  linde believes the merger will combine linde ag’s long-held expertise in technology with praxair’s efficient operating 
model, thus creating a global leader. the company is expected to enjoy strong positions in key geographies and end markets and will 
create a more diverse and balanced global portfolio.
linde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide.  it continues to be a major technological innovator in the industrial gases 
industry. its primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and rare gases) and 
process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, and acetylene).  the company also designs, 
engineers, and builds equipment that produces industrial gases primarily for internal use and offers its customers a wide range of gas 
production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants 
and other types of plants. the surface technologies segment supplies wear-resistant and high-temperature corrosion-resistant metallic 
and ceramic coatings and powders. 
 linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, petroleum refining, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, 
fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment.
in 2018, the company, praxair and linde ag entered into various agreements with regulatory authorities to satisfy antitrust 
requirements to secure approval to consummate the business combination.  these agreements required the sale of the majority of 
praxair's european industrial gases business (completed on 3 december 2018), the majority of linde ag's americas industrial gases 
business (completed on 1 march 2019), as well as certain divestitures of other praxair and linde ag businesses in asia that are 
expected to be sold in 2019. as of 31 december 2018 and until the completion of the majority of such divestitures, linde ag and 
praxair were obligated to operate their businesses globally as separate and independent companies, and not coordinate any of their 
commercial operations.  the u.s. federal trade commission's (the “ftc”) hold separate order restrictions were lifted 1 march 2019, 
concurrent with the sale of the required merger-related divestitures in the united states.  see note 3 to the consolidated financial 
statements for additional information relating to divestitures.
praxair was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the business combination.  accordingly, the historical financial 
statements of praxair for the periods prior to the business combination are considered to be the historical financial statements of the 
company.  the results of linde ag are included in linde's consolidated results from the date of the completion of the business 
combination forward.  also, during 2018 the company reported its continuing operations in six reporting segments under which it 
managed its operations, assessed performance, and reported earnings: north america, south america, asia, europe, surface 
technologies and linde ag. linde ag became the sixth reportable segment effective with the merger on 31 october  2018.
  process gases, including carbon dioxide, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, helium, specialty gases and acetylene are produced by 
methods other than air separation. most carbon dioxide is purchased from by-product sources, including chemical plants, refineries and 
industrial processes or is recovered from carbon dioxide wells. carbon dioxide is processed in linde’s plants to produce commercial and 
food-grade carbon dioxide. hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be produced by either steam methane reforming or auto-thermal reforming 
of natural gas or other feed streams such as naphtha. hydrogen is also produced by purifying by-product sources obtained from the 
chemical and petrochemical industries. most of the helium sold by linde is sourced from certain helium-rich natural gas streams in the 
united states, with additional supplies being acquired from outside the united states. acetylene is primarily sourced as a chemical by-
product, but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water.
5
industrial gases distribution
  there are three basic distribution methods for industrial gases: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) 
packaged or cylinder gases. these distribution methods are often integrated, with products from all three supply modes coming from the 
same plant. the method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost means of meeting the customer’s needs, depending upon 
factors such as volume requirements, purity, pattern of usage, and the form in which the product is used (as a gas or as a cryogenic liquid).
  on-site. customers that require the largest volumes of product (typically oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen) and that have a relatively 
constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers’ 
sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. on-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts 
with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and containing minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. many of 
the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single 
customer. advanced air separation processes allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements. customers using 
these systems usually enter into requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years.
  merchant. the merchant business is generally associated with distributable liquid oxygen, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, 
hydrogen and helium. the deliveries generally are made from linde’s plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site 
which are owned and maintained by linde and leased to the customer. due to distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally 
have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be 
shipped much longer distances. the customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three-to seven-year requirement 
contracts.
  packaged gases. customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in metal containers called cylinders, under medium 
to high pressure. packaged gases include atmospheric gases, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, acetylene and related products. linde 
also produces and distributes in cylinders a wide range of specialty gases and mixtures. cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s 
site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply 
contracts and through purchase orders.
  a substantial amount of the cylinder gases sold in the united states is distributed by independent distributors that buy merchant 
gases in liquid form and repackage the products in their facilities. packaged gas distributors, including linde, also distribute hardgoods 
and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. over time, linde has acquired a number of independent industrial 
gases and welding products distributors at various locations in the united states and continues to sell merchant gases to other independent 
distributors. between its own distribution business, joint ventures and sales to independent distributors, linde is represented in 48 states, 
the district of columbia and puerto rico.
engineering
  linde’s engineering division has a global presence, with its focus on market segments such as olefin, natural gas, air separation, 
hydrogen and synthesis gas plants. the company utilizes its own extensive process engineering know-how in the planning, project 
development and construction of turnkey industrial plants and associated services. linde plants are used in a wide variety of fields: in 
the petrochemical and chemical industries, in refineries and fertilizer plants, to recover air gases, to produce hydrogen and synthesis 
gases, to treat natural gas and to produce noble gases. the engineering division either supplies plant components and services directly 
to the customer or to the industrial gas business of linde, which operates the plants on behalf of the customer under a long-term gases 
supply contract.
surface technologies
  surface technologies is a leading worldwide supplier of coating services and thermal spray consumables to customers in the 
aircraft, energy, printing, primary metals, petrochemical, textile, and other industries. its coatings are used to provide wear resistance, 
corrosion protection, thermal insulation, and many other surface-enhancing functions which serve to extend component life, enable 
optimal performance, and reduce operating costs. it also manufactures a complete line of electric arc, plasma and wire spray, and high-
velocity oxy-fuel ("hvof") equipment.

business review
on 31 october 2018 praxair and linde ag combined their respective businesses through an all-stock merger transaction, and 
became subsidiaries of linde plc. the year ended 31 december 2018 reflects the results of praxair for the entire year and the results of 
linde ag for the period beginning after 31 october 2018. 
consolidated results of operations
the year ended 31 december 2018 reflects the results of praxair for the entire year and the results of linde ag for the period 
beginning after 31 october 2018 (the merger date), including the impacts of acquisition ("purchase") accounting (see note 2 to the 
consolidated financial statements).  the historical periods prior to 2018 reflect the results of praxair, inc.
the following table provides summary results of operations of linde plc for 2018 and 2017: 
(millions of dollars)

attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 20 $ 61 $ (41 ) (67)%
diluted earnings per share from continuing 
operations - linde plc shareholders $ 14.02 $ 4.40 $ 9.62 219 %
results of operations, 2018 compared with 2017 
sales increased 31% to $15,037 million in 2018 compared to $11,437 million in 2017 primarily reflecting the merger with linde 
ag which contributed 26% to sales. excluding the merger impact, sales increased 5% driven by higher volumes and pricing.  volume 
growth of 4% was primarily due to higher volumes in north america and asia, including new project start-ups.  higher overall pricing 
across all geographic segments contributed 2% to sales.  currency translation impact decreased sales by about 1%. and higher cost 
pass-through, primarily natural gas, increased sales by about 1% with minimal impact on operating profit.  the divestiture of praxair's 
european businesses in december of 2018 decreased sales by 1%.  
gross profit increased $360 million, or 9%, versus 2017 primarily due to the merger.  gross margin as a percentage of sales 
declined to 28.9% in 2018 from 34.9% in 2017 and was negatively impacted by a $368 million charge for the fair value step-up of 
inventories acquired in the merger and $235 million for additional depreciation related to purchase accounting.  excluding these 
charges, gross margin in 2018 was 32.9%. 
marketing and selling expenses, and research and development costs ("sg&a/r&d") increased $819 million in 2018 to $2,374 
million, primarily due to the merger.  sg&a/r&d for 2018 includes $146 million for additional depreciation and amortization related 
to the required purchase accounting.  also, sg&a/r&d includes transaction costs and other charges of $309 million in 2018 and $52 
million in 2017, primarily related to the merger.  excluding the purchase accounting and transaction cost impacts, sg&a/r&d was 
12.8% of sales in 2018 versus 13.1% in 2017.
net gain on divestiture of businesses and other operating income and expenses - net in 2018 of $3,737 million, includes a $3,778 
million net gain on the sale of businesses related primarily to the divestiture of praxair's european industrial gases business in 
connection with the merger (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). other expenses – net in 2018 was $41 million versus 
a $4 million benefit in 2017 (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of major components). 
7
operating profit of $5,710 million in 2018 was $3,274 million, or 134% higher than reported operating profit of $2,436 million 
in 2017.  2018 includes a net gain on divestiture of businesses of $3,778 million, partially offset by transaction costs and other charges 
of $309 million, and purchase accounting impacts of $739 million related to the linde ag merger (see notes 1, 2, and 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements). 2017 included transaction costs of $52 million.  excluding the impact of these items, adjusted 
operating profit of $2,980 million in 2018 was $492 million, or 19.8%, higher than adjusted operating profit of $2,488 million in 2017 
driven primarily by the merger.  also, excluding these impacts the operating margin was 19.8%  in 2018 versus 21.8% in 2017 
reflecting the impact of the merger since the merger date.  higher volumes and price in the geographic segments and surface 
technologies also contributed to operating profit growth.  a discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment 
discussion that follows. 
financial expense – net in 2018 increased $53 million, or 27%, versus 2017.  2018 included charges of $26 million relating to 
the early redemption of notes and a decrease of $21 million related to purchase accounting impacts related to the fair value of debt 
acquired in the merger (see notes 20 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively). excluding these impacts, adjusted 
interest expense of $253 million increased $58 million, or 30%, largely attributable to interest on the debt acquired in the merger and 
lower capitalized interest.  see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information relating to interest expense.
linde’s equity investments are primarily located in the united states, china and the middle east. equity income increased $7 
million in 2018 versus 2017 and included charges of $3 million for purchase accounting impacts related to the fair value step up of 
equity investments acquired in the merger.  excluding this impact, equity income increased $10 million, primarily driven by income 
from equity investments acquired in the merger.
the reported effective tax rate ("etr") for 2018 was 14.7% versus 41.7% in 2017.  the decrease in the etr for the 2018 period 
versus prior year was primarily due to the impact of the sale of praxair's european industrial gases business.   the etr for the 2017 
period included a net $394 million charge related to the u.s tax act. excluding these impacts, the etr for the 2018 and 2017 periods 
was 22.5% and 28.1%, respectively.  the decrease was driven primarily by the impact of the tax act enacted in the fourth quarter of 
2017 which lowered the u.s. statutory tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018 (see note 10 to the consolidated financial 
statements). 
income from continuing operations for 2018 was $4,705 million, $3,371 million or 253% higher than reported income from 
continuing operations of $1,334 million in 2017.  this is primarily due to the higher operating profit from continuing operations of 
3,274 million and the lower effective tax rate. 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations ("eps") of $14.02 in 2018 increased $9.62 per diluted share, or 219% 
from $4.40 in 2017.  this is primarily due to the increase in income from continuing operations partially offset by an increase in 
diluted shares resulting from equity acquired in the merger.

segment discussion
through 31 october 2018 the company’s operations were organized into five reportable segments, four of which have been 
determined on a geographic basis of segmentation: north america, europe, south america and asia. the company’s surface technologies 
business represents the fifth reportable segment.   these segments are comprised of praxair businesses for all years presented.  as discussed 
above in the section "principal activities"  linde ag became a separate sixth reportable segment effective with the merger on 31 october 
2018 and, accordingly, linde ag’s operations were included in the consolidated financial statements effective from the merger date (see 
notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information).
historically and through 2018, linde assessed the performance of the operating segments determined in accordance with u.s. 
gaap.  accordingly, the analysis of key performance indicators and the associated segment discussion that follows are based on u.s. 
gaap results. a reconciliation from u.s. gaap results to those determined under eu-ifrs (“ifrs”) for the years ended 31 
december 2018 and 2017 is also provided.  the following summary of u.s. gaap sales and operating profit by segment provides a 
basis for the discussion that follows (for additional information concerning linde’s segments, see note 26 to the consolidated financial 
statements). linde evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on operating profit, excluding the items not indicative 
of ongoing business trends (“segment operating profit”).

the business combination completed during the year.
(2)  primarily related to merger transaction costs. 
(3)  related to the sale of praxair’s european industrial gases business (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). this balance differs from that 
realized for ifrs reporting purposes due to the cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations having been set to zero as at 1 
january 2017 due to ifrs 1 adoption (see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements).

(4)  impacts of the required purchase accounting related to the merger transaction (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
(5)  primarily related to consolidation of certain entities acquired as part of the business combination during the year for ifrs and equity method for u.s. 
gaap,  gain on the divestiture of businesses due to ifrs 1 adoption (see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements), and pension accounting. 
 north america
the north america segment includes praxair's historical industrial gases operations in the united states, canada and mexico.
sales for 2018 increased $397 million, or 7%, versus 2017.  higher cost pass-through, primarily higher natural gas prices passed 
through to hydrogen customers, increased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit.  excluding cost pass–through, sales 
increased 6% primarily due to higher volumes to most end-markets and higher pricing. 
operating profit in 2018 increased $131 million, or 9% from 2017 driven by higher volumes and pricing.  operating profit for 2018 
also included a $30 million asset impairment charge which was more than offset by $43 million of gains on asset disposals.  
europe
the european segment includes praxair's historical industrial gases operations in spain, ireland, italy, france, germany,  russia, 
the united kingdom, scandinavia and the benelux region.  in connection with the merger, praxair was required to sell the majority of 
its european industrial gases business.  the sale was completed on 3 december 2018 and, accordingly, the european business results are 
included in the consolidated financial statements through the date of sale (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
sales in 2018 increased $34 million, or 2% from 2017.  the divestiture of the european businesses decreased sales by 7%.  excluding 
the divestiture impact, sales increased 9% from 2017.  higher cost pass-through increased sales by 2% with minimal impact on operating 
profit.  favorable currency translation increased sales by 4%.  higher volumes and higher price increased sales by 1% and 2%, respectively. 
operating profit in 2018 of $316 million increased $15 million, or 5%  from 2017.  the divestiture of the european businesses 
decreased operating profit by 7%.  currency translation impact increased operating profit by 5%.  excluding the divestiture and currency 
impacts, operating profit increased 7% driven by higher price and higher volumes, partially offset by cost inflation.     
south america
the south america segment includes praxair's historical industrial gases operations in brazil, argentina, bolivia, chile, colombia, 
paraguay, peru, and uruguay.
sales in 2018 decreased $132 million, or 9%, versus 2017.  unfavorable currency impacts decreased sales by 12% driven by the 
weakening of the brazilian real and argentine peso against the u.s. dollar.  excluding currency, sales increased 3% driven by higher 
price and volumes. 
operating profit decreased $24 million or 10% versus 2017. excluding unfavorable currency impacts of 18%, operating profit 
increased  8% driven by higher price and lower costs partially offset by unfavorable sales mix.
asia
the asia segment includes praxair's historical industrial gases operations in china, india, korea and thailand, with smaller 
operations in taiwan and the middle east.
sales in 2018 increased $226 million, or 13% versus 2017.  cost pass-through, primarily energy, and currency impacts each increased 
sales by 1%.  volume growth of 9% was primarily attributable to base volume growth in china, korea and india and new project start-
ups in china.  higher price increased sales by 2% driven by china.  sales growth was the strongest in the metals, energy and electronics 
end-markets. 
operating profit for 2018 increased $94 million, or 28%, as compared to the prior year driven by higher volumes and price.  operating 
profit for 2018 included a $22 million asset impairment charge, offset by a litigation settlement gain.
surface technologies
praxair's historical surface technologies business provides high-performance coatings and thermal-spray powders and equipment 
in the americas, europe, and asia.
sales increased $65 million, or 11% versus 2017  primarily due to higher volumes to the aerospace and manufacturing end-markets 
and higher price.  currency translation increased sales by 2%.    
operating profit increased $12 million, or 11% versus 2017.  currency translation increased operating profit by 2%.  excluding 
currency impacts, operating profit increased 9% driven by increased volumes and price partially offset by project ramp up costs.    
10
linde ag
linde ag became a sixth reportable segment effective with the merger on 31 october 2018.  sales of $2,873 million and $204 
million operating profit of represent results for the two month period from merger date through 31 december 2018.

total equity and liabilities $ 94,583 $ 20,436 $ 74,147 363%
goodwill increased $23,505 million to $26,738 million as of 31 december 2018 from $3,233 million as of 31 december 
2017. this increase is primarily related to the merger with linde ag partially offset by the sale of praxair's european industrial 
gases business  (see notes 2, 3 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements).
other intangible assets – net increased $16,496 million to $17,281 million as of 31 december 2018 from $785 million as of 
31 december 2017. this increase is primarily related to the merger with linde ag (see notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated 
financial statements).
tangible assets (property, plant and equipment – net) increased $18,868 million to $30,693 million as of 31 december 2018 
from $11,825 million as of 31 december 2017. this increase is primarily related to the merger with linde ag partially offset by 
the sale of praxair's european industrial gases business and depreciation  (see notes 2, 3 and 13 to the consolidated financial 
statements).
other assets increased $5,692 million to $9,668 million as of 31 december 2018 from $3,976 million as of 31 december 
2017. this increase is primarily related to the merger with linde ag which increased other assets by $7,025 million.  this increase 
was partially offset by $670 million decrease due to the sale of praxair's european industrial gases business and a $368 million 
decrease in inventories from the sale of inventories acquired at fair value in the merger.  see notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated 
financial statements.  
non-current assets classified as held for sale net of liabilities in connection with non-current assets classified as held for sale 
and disposal groups was $4,807 million at 31 december 2018.  as described in note 1, as a condition of the european commission 
("ec"), the u.s. department of justice ("doj"), and other governmental regulatory authorities approval of the merger, linde plc, 
praxair and linde ag were required to divest various businesses in europe, the americas and asia. the balance at 31 december 
2018 represents the fair value of these businesses which has been determined based on the estimated net selling prices or sales 
agreements. actual amounts may differ from this preliminary determination. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 
for further information on merger-related divestitures.
cash and cash equivalents increased $3,916 million to $4,533 million  as of 31 december 2018 from $617 million as of 31 
december 2017.  this increase is primarily a result of the all stock merger with linde ag and proceeds from the sale of praxair's 
european industrial gases business, partially offset by debt repayments.  the cash is available for corporate uses, including among 
others the planned squeeze-out of  the 8% linde ag noncontrolling interests and stock buybacks (see the consolidated statement of 
cash flows, and notes 1, 2, 20 and 34 to the consolidated financial statements).
12
equity increased $51,173 million to $57,789 million as of 31 december 2018 from $6,616 million as of 31 december 2017. 
this increase was primarily due to the all stock merger with linde ag which increased equity by $49,062 million and net income 
of $4,803 million, partially offset by dividends of $1,215 million (see the statement of changes in consolidated equity and note 17 
to the consolidated financial statements).
pension obligations and other provisions increased $2,010 million to $3,098 million as of 31 december 2018 from $1,088 
million as of 31 december 2017.  this increase is primarily related to the merger with linde ag (see note 2 to the consolidated 
financial statements). 
 
financial debt (the sum of short-term debt, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt), increased $6,293 million to 
$15,289 million as of 31 december 2018 from $8,996 million as of 31 december2017.  this increase is primarily related to the 
merger with linde ag (see notes 2 and  20 to the consolidated financial statements).
other liabilities increased $13,808 million to $17,544 million as of 31 december2018 from $3,736 million as of 31 december 
2017. this increase is primarily related to the merger with linde ag, partially offset by the sale of praxair's european industrial 
gases business (see notes 2 and  3 to the consolidated financial statements).

liquidity and capital resources
following is a summary of the consolidated statement of cash flows:
(millions of dollars)
year ended 31 december 2018 2017 variance
cash flow from operating activities $ 3,683 $ 3,041 $ 642
cash flow (for)/from investing activities 5,435 (1,314) 6,749
cash flow for financing activities (5,031) (1,656) (3,375)

cash and cash equivalents, beginning -of-period 617 524 93
cash and cash equivalents, end-of-period $ 4,533 $ 617 $ 3,916
cash increased $3,916 million in 2018 versus 2017. the primary sources of cash in 2018 were cash flows from operations of 
$3,683 million, proceeds from divestitures and asset sales of $5,897 million and cash acquired in the merger of $1,431 million. the 
primary uses of cash included capital expenditures of $1,886 million, cash dividends to shareholders of $1,166 million, net debt 
repayments of $2,915 million and net purchases of ordinary shares of $599 million.
operating cash flows
cash flows from operations was $3,683 million, or 24% of sales, an increase of $642 million from $3,041 million, or 27% of 
sales in 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to the merger, higher net income adjusted for non-cash charges and favorable 
working capital requirements, partially offset by higher pension contributions.
investing cash flows
net cash provided by investing activities of $5,435 million increased $6,749 million from $1,314 million used in 2017. this 
increase in investing cash flows was primarily driven by proceeds from the divestiture of praxair's european business and cash 
acquired in the merger, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. 
divestitures and asset sales in 2018 totaled $5,897 million primarily driven by proceeds from merger-related divestitures 
including $5,562 million from the sale of praxair's european business and $214 million related to the sale of praxair's italian joint 
venture (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
capital expenditures in 2018 were $1,886 million, an increase of $575 million from 2017, driven primarily by the merger 
with linde ag. capital expenditures during 2018 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for 
growth and density. approximately 50% of the capital expenditures were in north america with the rest in asia, europe, south 
america and linde ag. 
acquisition expenditures in 2018 were $25 million, a decrease of $8 million from 2017.  additionally, $1,431 million of cash 
was acquired in the merger (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). 
financing cash flows
linde’s financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial 
paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. linde’s international operations are funded through a combination of local 
borrowing and inter-company funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize currency exchange 
exposures. as deemed necessary, linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives.
cash used for financing activities was $5,031 million in 2018 compared to $1,656 million in 2017. the primary financing 
uses of cash were for net debt repayments, cash dividends and net purchases of linde ordinary shares. cash dividends of $1,166 
million increased $265 million from 2017 driven primarily by higher shares outstanding after the merger and a 5% increase in 
dividends per share from $3.15 to $3.30.  net purchases of ordinary shares were $522 million in 2018 versus net issuances of 
ordinary shares of $108 million in 2017 driven by increased share repurchases.  noncontrolling interest transactions and other 
payments was $425 million in 2018 versus $92 million in 2017.  amounts paid in 2018 include $315 million for the purchase of 
the noncontrolling interest in praxair's italian joint venture in a merger-related transaction (see note 3 to the consolidated financial 
statements) and $26 million in interest related to the early redemption of bonds (see note 20 to the consolidated financial 
statements); while 2017 include dividends paid to nci joint venture partners and repayment of project advances.  the cash used 
for debt repayments-net of $2,915 million increased $2,144 million from $771 million during 2017 while cash increased $3,916 
14
million. net debt (defined as debt minus cash) increased $2,377 million primarily due to debt acquired in the merger partially 
offset by the repayments of debt and increased cash.
the company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate 
amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. in march 2019, linde's credit ratings as reported by standard & 
poor’s and moody’s were a-1 and p-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and a and a2 for long-term debt, respectively.
note 20 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company’s debt repayments in 
2018, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and note 24 to the consolidated financial statements 
includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and 
are non-cancelable until maturity. therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make 
required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. linde’s major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain 
standard covenants. the company was in compliance with these covenants at 31 december 2018 and expects to remain in 
compliance for the foreseeable future.
linde’s total net financial debt outstanding (i.e. total financial debt less cash) at 31 december 2018 was $10,756 million, or 
$2,377 million higher than $8,379 million at 31 december 2017. the 31 december 2018 net debt balance includes $14,258 million 
in public securities, $1,031 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings, and less $4,533 million of cash. linde’s 
global effective borrowing rate was approximately 1.96% for 2018.
following is a summary of  notes that were repaid in 2018 and 2019:
•  in march 2018, linde repaid $500 million of 1.20% notes that became due. 
•  in november 2018, linde repaid $475 million of 1.25% notes that became due. 
•  in december 2018, linde repaid $600 million of 4.50% notes due 2019 and €600 million of 1.50% notes due 
2020 resulting in a $26 million interest charge (see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements).
•  also in december 2018, linde repaid €750 million of 3.125% notes that became due.
in february 2019, linde repaid $500 million of 1.90% notes that became due.
in june 2018, the company's $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks expired and was not 
renewed.  
on 10 december 2018 the company announced a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, of which $629 million had been 
repurchased through 31 december 2018.  this program was completed in february of 2019.  on 22 january 2019, the company’s 
board of directors approved the additional repurchase of up to $6.0 billion of its ordinary shares with a stated expiration date of 1 
february 2021.

principal risks and uncertainties
due to the size and geographic reach of the company’s operations, a wide range of factors, many of which are outside of the 
company’s control, could materially affect the company’s future operations and financial performance. management believes the following 
risks may significantly impact the company: 
the company may fail to realize the anticipated strategic and financial benefits sought from the business combination.
the company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the business combination between praxair, inc. and linde ag, which 
was completed on 31 october 2018. the success of the business combination will depend on, among other things, the company’s ability 
to combine praxair, inc.’s and linde ag’s businesses in a manner that facilitates growth and realizes the anticipated annual synergies 
and cost reductions without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. the actual integration will continue 
to involve complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. difficulties in the integration of the businesses, which 
may result in significant costs and delays, include:
•  managing a significantly larger combined group;
•  aligning and executing the strategy of the company;
•  integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to customers and coordinating distribution and marketing 
efforts in geographically separate organizations;
•  coordinating corporate and administrative infrastructures and aligning insurance coverage;
•  coordinating accounting, reporting, information technology, communications, administration and other systems;
•  addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;
•  the company being subject to irish laws and regulations and legal action in ireland;
•  coordinating the compliance program and uniform financial reporting, information technology and other standards, 
controls, procedures and policies;
•  the implementation, ultimate impact and outcome of post-completion reorganization transactions, such as the squeeze-
out with respect to remaining minority linde ag shareholders, which has subsequently been completed;
•  unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the business combination or the combined businesses;
•  managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating operations;
•  identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets; and
•  effecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.  
these and other factors could result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, as well as decreases in the 
amount of expected revenue and earnings. the integration process and other disruptions resulting from the business combination may 
also adversely affect the company’s relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, distributors, licensors and others with whom 
praxair, inc. and linde ag have business or other dealings, and difficulties in integrating the businesses could harm the reputation of the 
company.
if the company is not able to successfully integrate the businesses of praxair, inc. and linde ag in an efficient, cost-effective and 
timely manner, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the business combination may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take 
longer to realize than expected.
weakening economic conditions in markets in which linde does business may adversely impact its financial results and/or cash 
flows.
linde serves a diverse group of industries across more than 100 countries, which generally leads to financial stability through 
various business cycles. however, a broad decline in general economic or business conditions in the industries served by its customers 
could adversely affect the demand for linde’s products and impair the ability of its customers to satisfy their obligations to linde, resulting 
in uncollected receivables and/or unanticipated contract terminations or project delays. for example, global political and economic 
uncertainty could reduce investment activities of linde’s customers, which could adversely affect linde’s engineering project business. 
in addition, many of linde’s customers are in businesses that are cyclical in nature, such as the chemicals, electronics, metals and 
energy industries. downturns in these industries may adversely impact linde during these cycles. additionally, such conditions could 
impact the utilization of linde’s manufacturing capacity which may require it to recognize impairment losses on tangible assets such as 
property, plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets such as goodwill, customer relationships or intellectual property. 
increases in the cost of energy and raw materials and/or disruption in the supply of these materials could result in lost sales or 
reduced profitability.
energy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases. most of linde’s energy requirements 
are in the form of electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution. linde attempts to minimize the financial impact of variability 
16
in these costs through the management of customer contracts and reducing demand through operational productivity and energy efficiency. 
large customer contracts typically have escalation and pass-through clauses to recover energy and feedstock costs. such attempts may 
not successfully mitigate cost variability, which could negatively impact linde’s financial condition or results of operations. the supply 
of energy has not been a significant issue in the geographic areas where linde conducts business. however, regional energy conditions 
are unpredictable and may pose future risk.
for carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, helium, hydrogen, specialty gases and surface technologies, raw materials are largely 
purchased from outside sources. where feasible, linde sources several of these raw materials, including carbon dioxide, hydrogen and 
calcium carbide, as chemical or industrial byproducts. in addition, linde has contracts or commitments for, or readily available sources 
of, most of these raw materials; however, their long-term availability and prices are subject to market conditions. a disruption in supply 
of such raw materials could impact linde’s ability to meet contractual supply commitments.
linde’s international operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad and international events and circumstances may 
adversely impact its business, financial condition or results of operations.
linde has substantial international operations which are subject to risks including devaluations in currency exchange rates, 
transportation delays and interruptions, political and economic instability and disruptions, restrictions on the transfer of funds, trade 
conflicts and the imposition of duties and tariffs, import and export controls, changes in governmental policies, labor unrest, possible 
nationalization and/or expropriation of assets, domestic and international tax laws and compliance with governmental regulations. these 
events could have an adverse effect on the international operations of linde in the future by reducing the demand for its products, 
decreasing the prices at which it can sell its products, reducing the revenue from international operations or otherwise having an adverse 
effect on its business. for example, linde has a meaningful presence in the u.k. and the u.k.’s ongoing exit process from the eu has 
continued to cause, and may in the future cause, political and economic uncertainty, which could have an adverse impact on the markets 
which linde supplies.
currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect linde's results.
because a significant portion of linde's revenue is denominated in currencies other than its reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, 
changes in exchange rates will produce fluctuations in revenue, costs and earnings and may also affect the book value of assets and 
liabilities and related equity. although the company from time to time utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures, 
its efforts to minimize currency exposure through such hedging transactions may not be successful depending on market and business 
conditions. as a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect linde’s financial condition, results of 
operations or cash flows.
macroeconomic factors may impact linde’s ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of obtaining financing which may 
adversely impact linde’s financial results and/or cash flows.
volatility and disruption in the u.s., european and global credit and equity markets, from time to time, could make it more difficult 
for linde to obtain financing for its operations and/or could increase the cost of obtaining financing. in addition, linde’s borrowing costs 
can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on its 
performance as measured by certain criteria such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these debt ratings could increase 
the cost of borrowing or make it more difficult to obtain financing. 
an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the company's financial results.
as of 31 december 2018, the net carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was $27 billion and $2 
billion, respectively, primarily as a result of the business combination and the related acquisition method of accounting applied to linde 
ag. in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the company periodically assesses these assets to determine if they 
are impaired. significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes 
in use of the assets, divestitures and sustained market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or 
other indefinite-lived assets. any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on linde's results of operations 
in the periods recognized. 
catastrophic events could disrupt the operations of linde and/or its customers and suppliers and may have a significant adverse 
impact on the results of operations.
the occurrence of catastrophic events or natural disasters such as extreme weather, including hurricanes and floods; health epidemics; 
and acts of war or terrorism, could disrupt or delay linde’s ability to produce and distribute its products to customers and could potentially 
expose linde to third-party liability claims. in addition, such events could impact linde’s customers and suppliers resulting in temporary 
or long-term outages and/or the limitation of supply of energy and other raw materials used in normal business operations. linde evaluates 
the direct and indirect business risks, consults with vendors, insurance providers and industry experts, makes investments in suitably 
17
resilient design and technology, and conducts regular reviews of the business risks with management. despite these steps, however, these 
situations are outside linde’s control and may have a significant adverse impact on its financial results.
the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel may adversely impact linde’s business.
if linde fails to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, it may not be able to develop, market or sell its products or successfully 
manage its business. linde is dependent upon a highly skilled, experienced and efficient workforce to be successful. much of linde’s 
competitive advantage is based on the expertise and experience of key personnel regarding marketing, technology, manufacturing and 
distribution infrastructure, systems and products. the inability to attract and hire qualified individuals or the loss of key employees in 
very skilled areas could have a negative effect on linde’s financial results.
if linde fails to keep pace with technological advances in the industry or if new technology initiatives do not become commercially 
accepted, customers may not continue to buy linde’s products and results of operations could be adversely affected.
linde’s research and development is directed toward developing new and improved methods for the production and distribution 
of industrial gases as well as for the design and construction of plants and toward developing new markets and applications for the use 
of industrial gases. this results in the introduction of new industrial gas applications and the development of new advanced air separation 
process technologies. as a result of these efforts, linde develops new and proprietary technologies and employs necessary measures to 
protect such technologies within the global geographies in which linde operates. these technologies help linde to create a competitive 
advantage and to provide a platform to grow its business. if linde’s research and development activities do not keep pace with competitors 
or if linde does not create new technologies that benefit customers, future results of operations could be adversely affected.
risks related to pension benefit plans may adversely impact linde’s results of operations and cash flows.
pension benefits represent significant financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet 
eligibility requirements. because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments and asset returns, 
significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to linde’s plans. linde utilizes the services of 
independent actuaries, whose models are used to facilitate these calculations. several key assumptions are used in the actuarial models 
to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. in particular, significant changes in 
actual investment returns on pension assets, discount rates, or legislative or regulatory changes could impact future results of operations 
and required pension contributions.
operational risks may adversely impact linde’s business or results of operations.
linde’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer 
contract requirements and other needs. insufficient or excess capacity threatens linde’s ability to generate competitive profit margins 
and may expose linde to liabilities related to contract commitments. operating results are also dependent on linde’s ability to complete 
new construction projects on time, on budget and in accordance with performance requirements. failure to do so may expose linde’s 
business to loss of revenue, potential litigation and loss of business reputation.
also inherent in the management of linde’s production facilities and delivery systems, including storage, vehicle transportation 
and pipelines, are operational risks that require continuous training, oversight and control. material operating failures at production, 
storage facilities or pipelines, including fire, toxic release and explosions, or the occurrence of vehicle transportation accidents could 
result in loss of life, damage to the environment, loss of production and/or extensive property damage, all of which may negatively impact 
linde’s financial results.
linde may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.
linde relies on information technology systems and networks for business and operational activities, and also stores and processes 
sensitive business and proprietary information in these systems and networks. these systems are susceptible to outages due to fire, flood, 
power loss, telecommunications failures, viruses, break-ins and similar events, or breaches of security. 
linde has taken steps to address these risks and concerns by implementing advanced security technologies, internal controls, network 
and data center resiliency and recovery process. despite these steps, however, operational failures and breaches of security from 
increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of confidential information, result in business interruption or 
malfunction or regulatory actions and have a material adverse impact on linde’s operations, reputation and financial results.
the inability to effectively integrate acquisitions or collaborate with joint venture partners could adversely impact linde’s financial 
position and results of operations.
in addition to the business combination, linde has evaluated and expects to continue to evaluate, a wide array of potential strategic 
acquisitions and joint ventures. many of these transactions, if consummated, could be material to its financial condition and results of 
18
operations. in addition, the process of integrating an acquired company, business or group of assets may create unforeseen operating 
difficulties and expenditures. although historically linde has been successful with its acquisition strategy and execution, the areas where 
linde may face risks include:
•  the need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at 
companies that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls, procedures and policies;
•  diversion of management time and focus from operating existing business to acquisition integration challenges;
•  cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into the existing organization;
•  the need to integrate each company’s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative 
systems to permit effective management;
•  difficulty with the assimilation of acquired operations and products;
•  failure to achieve targeted synergies and cost reductions; and
•  inability to retain key employees and business relationships of acquired companies.
foreign acquisitions and joint ventures involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned herein, including those related to 
integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks 
associated with specific countries. 
also, the anticipated benefit of potential future acquisitions may not materialize. future acquisitions or dispositions could result 
in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or impairments of goodwill, any of which could adversely impact 
linde’s financial results.
linde is subject to a variety of international laws and government regulations and changes in, or failure to comply with, these laws 
or regulations could have an adverse impact on the company’s business, financial position and results of operations.
linde is subject to regulations in the following areas, among others:
•  environmental protection, including climate change and energy efficiency laws and policies;
•  domestic and international tax laws and currency controls;
•  safety;
•  securities laws applicable in the united states, the european union, germany, ireland, and other jurisdictions;
•  trade and import/export restrictions, as well as economic sanctions laws;
•  antitrust matters;
•  data protection;
•  global anti-bribery laws, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act; and
•  healthcare regulations.
changes in these or other regulatory areas, such as evolving environmental legislation in china, may impact linde’s profitability 
and may give rise to new or increased compliance risks: it may become more complex and costly to ensure compliance, and the level of 
sanctions in the event of non-compliance may rise. such changes may also restrict linde’s ability to compete effectively in the marketplace. 
noncompliance with such laws and regulations could result in penalties or sanctions, cancellation of marketing rights or restrictions on 
participation in, or even exclusion from, public tender proceedings, all of which could have a material adverse impact on linde’s financial 
results and/or reputation. 
doing business globally requires linde to comply with anti-corruption, trade, compliance and economic sanctions and similar laws, 
and to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure that its employees and other intermediaries comply with the applicable 
restrictions. these restrictions include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products, services and any other economic resources 
to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities. compliance with these restrictions requires, among other things, 
screening of business partners. despite its commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics, the company cannot ensure that its 
policies and procedures will always protect it from intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by employees or agents under the 
applicable laws. if linde fails to comply with laws governing the conduct of international operations, linde may be subject to criminal 
and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could materially adversely affect its reputation, business and results of operations.
the outcome of litigation or governmental investigations may adversely impact the company’s business or results of operations.
linde’s subsidiaries are party to various lawsuits and governmental investigations arising in the ordinary course of business. adverse 
outcomes in some or all of the claims pending may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect 
linde’s ability to conduct business. linde and its subsidiaries may in the future become subject to further claims and litigation, which is 
impossible to predict.  the litigation and other claims linde faces are subject to inherent uncertainties. legal or regulatory judgments or 
agreed settlements might give rise to expenses which are not covered, or are not fully covered, by insurance benefits and may also lead 
to negative publicity and reputational damage. an unfavorable outcome or determination could cause a material adverse impact on the 
company’s results of operations.
19
potential product defects or inadequate customer care may adversely impact linde’s  business or results of operations.
risks associated with products and services may result in potential liability claims, the loss of customers or damage to linde’s 
reputation. principal possible causes of risks associated with products and services are product defects or an inadequate level of customer 
care when linde is providing services.
linde is exposed to legal risks relating to product liability in the countries where it operates, including countries such as the united 
states, where legal risks (in particular through class actions) have historically been more significant than in other countries. the outcome 
of any pending or future products and services proceedings or investigations cannot be predicted and legal or regulatory judgments or 
agreed settlements may give rise to significant losses, costs and expenses.
the manufacturing and sale of products as well as the construction of plants by linde may give rise to risks associated with the 
production, filling, storage, handling and transport of raw materials, goods or waste. industrial gases are potentially hazardous substances 
and medical gases and the related healthcare services must comply with the relevant specifications in order to not adversely affect the 
health of patients treated with them.
linde’s products and services, if defective or not handled or performed appropriately, may lead to personal injuries, business 
interruptions, environmental damages or other significant damages, which may result, among other consequences, in  liability, losses, 
monetary penalties or compensation payments, environmental clean-up costs or other costs and expenses, exclusion from certain market 
sectors deemed important for future development of the business and loss of reputation.  all these consequences could have a material 
adverse effect on linde’s business and results of operations.
u.s. civil liabilities may not be enforceable against linde.
linde is organized under the laws of ireland and substantial portions of its assets will be located outside of the united states. in 
addition, certain directors and officers of linde and its subsidiaries reside outside the united states. as a result, it may be difficult for 
investors to effect service of process within the united states upon linde or such persons, or to enforce outside the united states judgments 
obtained against such persons in u.s. courts in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the u.s. 
federal securities laws. in addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located 
outside the united states, rights predicated upon the u.s. federal securities laws.
a judgment for the payment of money rendered by a court in the united states based on civil liability would not be automatically 
enforceable in ireland. there is no treaty between ireland and the united states providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign 
judgments. the following requirements must be met before the foreign judgment will be deemed to be enforceable in ireland (i) the 
judgment must be for a definite sum, (ii) the judgment must be final and conclusive; and (iii) the judgment must be provided by a court 
of competent jurisdiction.
an irish court will also exercise its right to refuse judgment if the foreign judgment (i) was obtained by fraud; (ii) violated irish 
public policy; (iii) is in breach of natural justice; or (iv) if the judgment is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment.
in addition, there is doubt as to whether an irish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability on linde  or such persons 
in an original action predicated solely upon the u.s. federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in ireland against 
linde or such member, officer or expert, respectively.
changes in tax laws or policy could adversely impact the company’s financial position or results of operations.
linde and its subsidiaries are subject to the tax rules and regulations in the u.s., germany, ireland, the u.k. and other countries 
in which they operate. those tax rules and regulations are subject to change on a prospective or retroactive basis. under current economic 
and political conditions, including the u.k.’s ongoing exit process from the eu, tax rates and policies in any jurisdiction, including the 
u.s., the u.k. and the eu, are subject to significant change. in particular,since linde is expected to be treated as u.k. tax resident, any 
potential changes in the tax rules applying to u.k. tax-resident companies would directly affect linde. 
a change in linde’s tax residency could have a negative effect on the company’s future profitability, and may trigger taxes on 
dividends or exit charges.  if linde ceases to be resident in the united kingdom and becomes resident in another jurisdiction, it may be 
subject to united kingdom exit charges, and/or could become liable for additional tax charges in the other jurisdiction.  if linde were to 
be treated as resident in more than one jurisdiction, it could be subject to duplicative taxation. furthermore, although linde is incorporated 
in ireland and is not expected to be treated as a domestic corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes, it is possible that the irs 
could disagree with this result or that changes in u.s. federal income tax law could alter this result.  if the irs successfully asserted such 
a position or the law were to change, significant adverse tax consequences may result for linde, the company and linde’s shareholders. 
 
when tax rules change, this may result in a higher tax expense and the need to make higher tax payments. in addition, changes in 
tax legislation may have a significant impact on linde’s and its subsidiaries’ tax receivables and tax liabilities as well as on their deferred 
20
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and uncertainty about the tax environment in some regions may restrict their opportunities to enforce 
their respective rights under the law. linde will also operate in countries with complex tax regulations which could be interpreted in 
different ways. interpretations of these regulations or changes in the tax system might have an adverse impact on the tax liabilities, 
profitability and business operations of linde.  linde and its subsidiaries are subject to periodic audits by the tax authorities in various 
jurisdictions or other review actions by the relevant financial or tax authorities. the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts 
recorded in linde’s or its subsidiaries’ financial statements and may materially affect their respective financial results for the period when 
such determination is made.  
financial instruments
in its normal operations, linde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, 
energy costs and to a lesser extent precious metal prices. the objective of financial risk management at linde is to minimize the negative 
impact of such fluctuations on the company’s earnings and cash flows. to manage these risks, among other strategies, linde routinely 
enters into various derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) including interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements, currency-
swap agreements, forward contracts, currency options, and commodity-swap agreements. these instruments are not entered into for 
trading purposes and linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments.  counterparties to linde’s derivatives are major 
banking institutions with credit ratings of investment grade or better thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss.  as of year-end, linde 
ag had existing credit support annexes ("csas") in place with their principal counterparties to minimize potential default risk and to 
mitigate counterparty risk. under the csas, the fair values of derivatives for the purpose of interest rate and currency management are 
collateralized with cash on a regular basis
there are three types of derivatives that the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to 
cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. fair-value exposures relate to changes in the 
fair value of recognized assets or liabilities, primarily financial assets and financial liabilities, and firm commitments. cash-flow exposures 
relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions for which no 
underlying exposure is yet reported in the consolidated statement of financial position. net investment exposures relate to the impact of 
foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.
interest rate risk
at 31 december 2018, linde had debt totaling $15,289 million ($8,996 million at 31 december 2017). for fixed-rate instruments, 
interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows. conversely, for floating-rate instruments, 
interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the instrument but impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming 
that other factors are held constant. at 31 december 2018, including the impact of derivatives linde had fixed-rate debt of $12,558 
million and floating-rate debt of $2,731 million, representing 82% and 18%, respectively, of total debt. at 31 december 2017, linde had 
fixed-rate debt of $8,249 million and floating-rate debt of $747 million, representing 92% and 8%, respectively, of total debt. 
in order to mitigate interest rate risk, when considered appropriate interest-rate swaps are entered into as hedges of underlying 
financial instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the underlying financial 
instrument. at 31 december 2018, linde had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps outstanding that were designated as hedging instruments 
of the underlying debt issuances - refer to note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
foreign currency risk
linde’s exchange-rate exposures result primarily from its investments and ongoing operations in south america (primarily brazil, 
argentina, chile and colombia), europe (primarily germany, scandinavia, and the united kingdom), canada, mexico, asia pacific 
(primarily australia, china, india, and korea) and other business transactions such as the procurement of equipment from foreign sources. 
linde frequently utilizes currency contracts to hedge these exposures. see note 24  to the consolidated financial statements for additional 
information. 
further details of the financial risk management objectives and policies and the exposure of the company to price risk, credit risk, 
liquidity risk and cash flow risk are provided in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.
research and development
linde’s research and development is directed toward developing new and improved methods for the production and distribution 
of industrial gases and the development of new markets and applications for these gases. this results in the development of new advanced 
air separation and hydrogen process technologies and the frequent introduction of new industrial gas applications. research and 
development for industrial gases is principally conducted at pullach, germany; tonawanda, new york and burr ridge, illinois.
linde conducts research and development for its surface technologies to improve the quality and durability of coatings and the use 
of specialty powders for new applications and industries. surface technologies research is conducted at indianapolis, indiana.

on 10 december 2018, the directors of linde plc declared an interim dividend of $0.825 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 
(the “q4 dividend”). the q4 dividend was payable on 27 december 2018 to shareholders of record on 18 december 2018.

 for additional information, see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. 
future developments
the company’s business is to build, own, and operate industrial gas plants in order to supply atmospheric and process gases to 
customers. as such, linde believes that its sale of gas project backlog is one indicator of future sales growth. at 31 december 2018, 
linde’s backlog of large projects under construction was $3.5 billion. this represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under 
construction. apac and americas represent 49 percent and 42 percent of the backlog, respectively, with the remaining backlog in emea.  
these plants will primarily supply customers in the energy, chemical, and electronics end-markets.
     the above guidance should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “forward-looking statements.”
     linde provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial earnings 
guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences. these materials are available on the company’s website, https://
www.linde.com/en/investors but are not incorporated herein.

borrowed in u.s. dollars, pounds sterling, euros and other currencies agreed to by the administrative agent and the lenders. the 
credit agreement also includes commitments for swingline loans of $200,000,000 (for u.s. dollar-denominated swingline loans) 
and €100,000,000 (for euro-denominated swingline loans) and for letters of credit, letters of indemnity and bank guarantees in approved 
currencies of $600,000,000. any usage of the commitments for swingline loans, letters of credit, letters of indemnity and bank 
guarantees will reduce availability for revolving loans.
any revolving loans and swingline loans outstanding under the credit agreement will bear interest based on libor, euribor 
or the base rate, as applicable, plus, in each case, an interest margin that is subject to a ratings-based pricing grid. commitment fees 
and other customary fees will be payable in connection with the credit agreement. the credit agreement contains customary

(“fse”). linde plc’s primary governance obligations arise by virtue of its listing on nyse, and as such, the company is subject to the 
corporate governance rules of the nyse, requiring it to adopt certain governance policies (which the company has complied with), 
and to the reporting and other rules of the united states securities and exchange commission (the “sec”), requiring it to file forms

internal corporate governance framework
linde plc is subject to its own internal corporate governance guidelines (the “guidelines”), as adopted by the board of directors of linde 
plc (the “board of directors” or “board”) at the effective time of the business combination, the current version of which is available at 
https://www.linde.com/en/about-linde/corporate-governance. the guidelines provide (among other things) that, during the integration 
phase, certain matters require approval by two-thirds of the board of directors, including appointment and removal of a director as the 
chairman of the board of directors and appointment and removal of the chief executive officer of linde plc.
internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process 
linde maintains accounting systems, including internal accounting controls, monitored by a staff of internal auditors, that are designed 
to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial records and the protection of assets. the concept of reasonable assurance 
is based on recognition that the cost of a system should not exceed the related benefits. the effectiveness of those systems depends 
primarily upon the careful selection of financial and other managers, clear delegation of authority and assignment of accountability, 
inculcation of high business ethics and conflict-of-interest standards, policies and procedures for coordinating the management of corporate 
resources, and the leadership and commitment of top management. 
25
the audit committee of the board of directors, which consists solely of non-employee directors, is responsible for overseeing the 
functioning of the accounting system and related controls and the preparation of annual financial statements. the audit committee 
periodically meets with management, internal auditors and the independent accountants to review and evaluate their accounting, auditing 
and financial reporting activities and responsibilities, including management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. 
the external auditors and internal auditors have full and free access to the audit committee and meet with the committee, with and 
without management present. details of the composition and operation of the audit committee are available at page 31 of this report.
linde’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is 
defined in exchange act rule 13a-15(f). under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the company’s 
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control 
over financial reporting based on the framework in  internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring 
organizations of the treadway commission (often referred to as coso). based on this evaluation, management concluded that the 
company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 31 december 2018.
linde’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 december 2018 did not include the internal control over financial 
reporting related to linde ag because the business was acquired in a merger accounted for as a business combination consummated 
during 2018.

as required by the takeover bids regulations, the information contained below represents the position as at 31 december 2018.

are non-voting shares and do not convey upon the holder the right to be paid a dividend or to receive notice of or to attend, vote or speak

voting power, full or limited or no voting power, and such designations, preferences or special rights and qualifications, limitations or 
restrictions thereof in any resolution adopted by the board of directors providing for the issuance of such class or series of preferred 
shares.

the board of directors may exercise all the borrowing powers of the company and may give security in connection therewith. these 
borrowing powers may be amended or restricted only by the shareholders in general meeting. 
the shareholders of the company in general meeting may at any time and from time to time by resolution increase the share capital of 
the company by such amount as they think proper. whenever the share capital of the company is so increased, the board of directors 
may, subject to various provisions of the articles, issue shares to such amount not exceeding the amount of such enlargement as they 
think proper. all ordinary shares so issued shall rank in equal priority with existing ordinary shares.
subject to provisions of the act, to any rights conferred on any class of shares in the company and to the articles, the company may 
purchase any of its shares of any class and may cancel any shares so purchased or hold such shares as treasury shares (the “treasury 
shares”) with liberty to re-issue any such treasury shares in accordance with section 109 of the act. the company shall not make market 
purchases of its own shares unless such purchases shall have been authorized by an ordinary resolution of the company.
for purposes of irish law, repurchases of shares in linde plc may be effected by a redemption if the repurchased shares are redeemable 
shares or are deemed to be redeemable shares by linde plc’s constitution. under irish law, a company may issue redeemable shares and 
redeem them out of distributable reserves or the proceeds of a new issue of shares for that purpose. all redeemable shares must also be 
fully paid. redeemable shares may, upon redemption, be cancelled or held in treasury. the linde plc constitution provides that, unless 
the board of directors determines otherwise, each linde plc ordinary share shall be deemed to be a redeemable share on, and from the 
time of, the existence or creation of an agreement, transaction or trade between linde plc and any person pursuant to which linde plc 
acquires or will acquire linde plc ordinary shares, or an interest in linde plc ordinary shares, from the relevant person. redeemable 
shares of linde plc shall have the same characteristics as any other linde plc share save that they shall be redeemable in accordance with 
the arrangement.
on 10 december 2018, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $1.0 billion of its ordinary shares (the 
“2018 program”). under this program, linde may acquire up to 5% of its outstanding ordinary shares in the period from 10 december 
2018 through 30 april 2019. the purpose of the program is to reduce the share capital or to meet obligations under linde equity awards.
on 21 january 2019, the board of directors authorized a further share repurchase program for up to $6.0 billion of its ordinary shares 
(the “2019 program”). under the 2019 program, linde may acquire up to 15% of its outstanding ordinary shares in the period from 1 
may 2019 (or the date following the announcement of the end of the 2018 program, if earlier) through 1 february 2021. the purpose of 
the 2019 program is to reduce the share capital or to meet obligations under linde equity awards.
28
both the 2018 program and the 2019 program have been structured as redemptions for irish law purposes and are being effected pursuant 
to article 9 of the articles.
severance and change-in-control arrangements
the company provides severance benefits to eligible employees, including executive officers, consistent with the terms of its severance 
programs and applicable local law.  the company has not entered into any executive severance compensation agreements with its new 
executive officers, however, in connection with the business combination, the company was required to assume severance agreements 
for the legacy praxair executive officers that provide double trigger benefits in the event that the legacy praxair executive officer’s 
employment with the company is terminated under certain circumstances prior to 31 october 2020.  similarly, the legacy linde executive 
officers are party to agreements with linde ag that provide severance entitlements in the event their employment ends under specified 
circumstances within nine months following the merger. 
change-in-control arrangements
at the time of the business combination between praxair and linde ag, each legacy praxair executive officer was party to a double-
trigger executive severance agreement with praxair that provided certain protections in the event that the executive officer’s employment 
was terminated by the company without “cause” or by the executive officer for “good reason,” in either case within the 24-month period 
immediately following a “change-in-control” (the “praxair severance agreements”).  the business combination constituted a change-
in-control and upon the closing, the company assumed the agreements.  while the legacy praxair executive officers continue to receive 
the protections afforded under the praxair severance agreements through 31 october 2020, the praxair severance agreements were not 
renewed at 31 december 2018 and no replacement severance agreements have been provided by the company to the executive officers.
the praxair severance agreements were adopted many years prior to the business combination and were meant to:
•  provide temporary income following an involuntary termination of employment,
•  encourage retention of executives for continuity of management, and
•  to keep executives focused on performing their duties in the event of a change-in-control transaction.
the terms of the praxair severance agreements include:
•  "double trigger” is required for payments:  the change-in-control must be followed by the termination of the executive officer’s 
employment within the following two years either by the company other than for cause or by executive with “good reason”
•  no “tax gross-ups” for excise taxes
•  as a condition of entering into the agreements, each executive officer was required to enter into a nondisclosure, nonsolicitation 
and noncompetition agreement under which the executive officer agrees not to:
•  disclose company confidential information both during and after termination of his or her employment with the company
•  solicit the company’s customers and employees for a period of two years following the executive officer’s termination of 
employment with the company for any reason
•  engage in any activities that compete with those of the company for a period of two years following the executive officer’s 
termination of employment
upon the occurrence of the “double trigger,” the severance agreements generally provide the affected executive officer with:
•  accrued salary, variable compensation, and benefits,
•  enhanced life, accident, health insurance and pension benefits, and
•  a lump sum severance payment equal to two times the sum of his or her annual salary and target performance-based variable 
compensation award (three times for executives who became officers of the praxair, inc. prior to 2010).
significant agreements relating to a change of control subsequent to a takeover bid 
in the financial years 2007 to 2017, linde ag issued benchmark bonds under its €10 billion debt issuance programme, either itself or 
via linde finance b. v., a dutch subsidiary of linde plc. under the terms and conditions of the bond issuances, in the event of a change 
of control of the company, the bond creditor may demand immediate repayment if such change of control leads to the withdrawal of the 
credit rating or to a reduction in the rating to or below certain credit rating levels for unsubordinated unsecured liabilities.
there are other significant financing agreements in place with the company / certain subsidiary companies, each of which includes specific 
rules that apply in the event of a change in control of the company. in particular, these rules provide for a duty on the part of the company / 
the relevant subsidiary to provide information to the contracting party, and also provide for cancellation rights for the contracting party.
29
there are customer contracts in place with the company/certain subsidiary companies, containing clauses granting the customer special 
cancellation rights in the event of a change of control of the company. in the event that these special cancellation rights are exercised, 
the contracts provide for appropriate compensation in favor of the customer.
under the terms and conditions of the 2009 praxair, inc. long-term incentive plan (the “2009 plan”), which was assumed by the company 
pursuant to the business combination, in the event of a change of control of the company, special rules may be adopted. those special 
rules, which apply to share options issued between 2013 and 2017 provide, in the event of a change of control of the company, that 
cancellation rights apply, which means that option/matching shares rights may be settled in cash in an amount to be determined in 
accordance with the 2009 plan.
shareholders’ meetings 
the company operates under the act. the act provides for two types of shareholder meetings: the agm with all other general meetings 
being called an egm. 
the company must hold a general meeting each year as its agm, in addition to any other general meetings held in that year. not more 
than 15 months may elapse between the date of one agm and the next. egms can also be convened at the request of shareholders holding 
not less than 5% of the voting share capital of the company. the notice period for an agm and an egm to consider any special resolution 
(a resolution which requires a 75% majority vote, not a simple majority) is 21 clear days. 
no business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is present at the time when the meeting proceeds to business. 
two shareholders present in person or by proxy and having the right to attend and vote at the meeting and together holding shares 
representing more than 50% of the votes that may be cast by all shareholders at the relevant time shall be a quorum. only those shareholders 
registered on the company’s register of shareholders at the prescribed record date, being a date not more than 48 hours before the general 
meeting to which it relates, are entitled to attend and vote at a general meeting. 
under the act, ordinary resolutions may be passed by a majority of votes cast in favor, while special resolutions require a 75% majority 
of votes cast in favor. any shareholder who is entitled to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting is entitled to appoint one or more 
proxies to attend, speak and vote on his or her behalf. a proxy need not be a shareholder of the company. all resolutions are determined 
by a poll. 
as further described on page 28, the management of the business of the company has been delegated by company’s shareholders to the 
board of directors, who may exercise all the powers of the company save for those reserved to shareholders. matters reserved to 
shareholders in general meetings include the election of directors, the declaration of final dividends on the recommendation of the directors, 
the fixing of the remuneration of the external auditor, amendments to the articles, measures to increase or reduce the ordinary share 
capital and the authority to issue shares. 
the information required to be provided to shareholders in accordance with sections 1099 to 1110 of the act is available on the company’s 
website (www.linde.com).

statement of disclosures to auditors
so far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, being

fellow directors and the company's auditor, each director has taken all the steps that he/she is obliged to take as a director in order to 
made himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information. 
directors' responsibility statement
the directors are responsible for preparing the directors’ report and the financial statements in accordance with irish law.
irish law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that gives a true and fair view of the company’s 
assets, liabilities and financial position as at the end of the financial year and of the profit and loss of the company for the financial year. 
under that law, the directors have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the european union (“ifrs”) and with those parts of the act applicable to companies applying ifrs and the 
parent company financial statements in accordance irish generally accepted accounting practice (accounting standards issued by the 
uk financial reporting council, including financial reporting standard 102 the financial reporting standard applicable in the uk 
and republic of ireland and irish law).
under irish law, the directors shall not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
company’s assets, liabilities and financial position as at the end of the financial year and the profit and loss of the company for the financial 
year.
in preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and identify the 
standards in question, subject to any material departures from those standards being disclosed and explained in the notes to the 
financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue 
in business.
the directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to:
•  correctly record and explain the transactions of the company;
•  enable, at any time, the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the company to be determined with reasonable 
accuracy; and
•  enable the directors to ensure that the financial statements comply with the companies act and enable those financial statements 
to be audited.
the directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
the directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company’s 
website. legislation in ireland governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.

group’s and the company’s assets, liabilities and financial position as at 31 december 2018 and of the group’s profit and cash flows for the 
year then ended;
•  the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards 
(“ifrss”) as adopted by the european union;
•  the entity financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice in ireland 
(accounting standards issued by the financial reporting council of the uk, including financial reporting standard 102 “the financial 
reporting standard applicable in the uk and republic of ireland” and irish law); and
•  the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the companies act 2014 and, as regards the 
group financial statements, article 4 of the ias regulation.
we have audited the financial statements, included within the directors’ report and financial statements (the annual report), which comprise:
•  the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 december 2018;
•  the company statement of financial position of linde plc as at 31 december 2018;

•  the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the entity financial statements, which include a description of the 
significant accounting policies.
our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the audit committee.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing (ireland) (“isas (ireland)”) and applicable law. our responsibilities 
under isas (ireland) are further described in the auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. we believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
independence
we remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in ireland, 
which includes iaasa’s ethical standard as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements.
to the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by iaasa’s ethical standard were not provided to the group 
or the company.
other than those disclosed in note 32 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the group or the company in the period 
from 1 january 2018 to 31 december 2018.

our audit approach
overview
materiality        
• $119 million – consolidated financial statements.
• based on circa 5% of profit before tax from continuing operations 
adjusted for non-recurring items relating to the gain on the 
divestiture of businesses, merger related inventory step up and 
initial transaction costs.
• $443 million - entity financial statements.
• based on circa 0.5% of net assets.
audit scope
• we conducted four full scope audits of the group’s largest 
reporting components.
• specified audit procedures were performed at three additional 
components.
• additionally, certain other activities controlled and managed 
centrally at group level such as acquisitions and disposals, 
intangible asset and goodwill accounting and impairment testing, 
financing and treasury, legal and certain elements of income taxes 
were audited as part of our group procedures.
•taken together, the components and group functions where we 
performed our audit work accounted for 80% of group net revenues 
and 87% of total assets. 
key audit matters
  valuation of property, plant and equipment and customer 
relationship intangible assets related to the linde ag merger
the scope of our audit
as part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. in particular, we 
looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. as in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of 
internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to 
fraud. 
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. these matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. this is not a 
complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

how we tailored the audit scope
we tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates. 
the group is structured along 6 segments, north america, south america, asia, europe, surface technologies and linde ag. there are a number of 
reporting components within each segment, mainly structured on a country level.  
certain other activities are controlled and managed centrally from corporate within the consolidated group such as acquisitions and disposals, 
intangible asset and goodwill accounting, impairment testing, financing and treasury, legal, stock based compensation and certain elements of income 
taxes. 
in determining our audit scope we first focused on individual reporting components and determined the type of work that needed to be performed at 
the reporting components by us, as the irish group engagement team, pwc us as the us component team, or other component auditors within the 
pwc network and other non-network firms. where the work was performed by pwc us and other component auditors, we determined the level of 
involvement we needed to have in the audit work of those reporting components to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. 
taken together the four full scope audits of the group’s largest reporting components, specified procedures performed at three components, and the 
audit work that was performed for group functions accounted for 80% of group net revenues and 87% of total assets. we allocated materiality levels 
and issued instructions to each component auditor. in addition to the audit report from each of the component auditors, we received detailed 
memoranda of examinations on work performed and relevant findings which supplemented our understanding of the component, its results and the 
audit findings. we also held discussions with component teams on the work performed and the detailed memoranda of examinations issued. this, 
together with additional procedures performed at the group level, gave us evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
materiality
the scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. we set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. these, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial 
statements as a whole.
based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
39
consolidated financial statements entity financial statements
overall materiality $119 million. $443 million.
how we determined it circa 5% of profit before tax from continuing circa 0.5% of net assets.
operations adjusted for non-recurring items
relating to the gain on the divestiture of businesses,
merger related inventory step up and initial
transaction costs.
rationale for benchmark the engagement team believes the adjusted profit the entity is a holding company whose
applied before tax is the most appropriate measure main activity is the management of
reflecting the underlying operations of the investments in subsidiaries.
combined company.
for each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. 
we agreed with the audit committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above $10 million (consolidated audit) 
and $10 million (company audit) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
conclusions relating to going concern
we have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which isas (ireland) require us to report to you where:
•  the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
•  the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the 
group’s or the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the 
date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
however, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s or the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
reporting on other information
the other information comprises all of the information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. the 
directors are responsible for the other information. our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we 
do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. if we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude 
whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. if, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. we have nothing to 
report based on these responsibilities.
with respect to the directors’ report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the companies act 2014 (excluding the information 
included in the “non-financial statement” as defined by that act on which we are not required to report) have been included.
based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, isas (ireland) and the companies act 2014 require 
us to also report certain opinions and matters as described below.
directors’ report
•  in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the directors’ report (excluding the 
information included in the “non-financial statement” on which we are not required to report) for the year ended 31 december 2018 
is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the applicable legal requirements.
40
•  based on our knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we 
have not identified any material misstatements in the directors’ report(excluding the information included in the “non-financial 
statement” on which we are not required to report). 
corporate governance statement
•  in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements:
  - the description of the main features of the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting 
process; and
    - the information required by section 1373(2)(d) of the companies act 2014;
  included in the corporate governance statement, is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance 
with section 1373(2) of the companies act 2014.
•  based on our knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit of the financial 
statements, we have not identified material misstatements in the description of the main features of the internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to the financial reporting process and the information required by section 1373(2)(d) of the 
companies act 2014 included in the corporate governance statement.
•  in our opinion, based on the work undertaken during the course of the audit of the financial statements, the information required by 
section 1373(2)(a),(b),(e) and (f) of the companies act 2014 and regulation 6 of the european union (disclosure of non-financial 
and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups) regulations 2017 is contained in the corporate governance 
statement.
responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
as explained more fully in the directors’ responsibility statement set out on page 35, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
the directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to 
liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with isas (ireland) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
a further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the iaasa website at:

•  the maintenance and integrity of the linde plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not

notes to the consolidated financial 
statements
[1] business overview and basis of preparation 
linde plc (“linde” or the “company”) was formed for the purpose of effecting the business combination comprising the merger of 
an indirect subsidiary of linde plc with and into praxair, inc (“praxair”), together with its subsidiaries, as a result praxair, inc. became 
a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of linde plc (“merger”). following the merger, linde plc acquired all outstanding shares of linde 
aktiengesellschaft (“linde ag”), which became a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of linde plc. linde plc trades on the new york 
stock exchange (“nyse”) and on the frankfurt stock exchange under the symbol lin.
praxair was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the business combination. the conclusion that praxair was the accounting 
acquirer under ifrs was based primarily on the following factors: (i) the background of the business combination, (ii) the business 
combination agreement, (iii) the anticipated share ownership and voting rights of the shareholders of each of the combining companies, 
(iv) the intended corporate governance structure of linde plc, (v) the designation of certain senior management positions, (vi) the relative 
market values, size, and profitability of the combining companies, and (vii) the premium provided to linde ag shareholders. although 
no single factor was the sole determinant, the primary factors that resulted in praxair being designated as the accounting acquirer were 
the intended governance structure, especially the composition of senior management positions including praxair’s chief executive officer 
and chief financial officer; the premium provided to linde ag shareholders embedded in the 1.54 exchange ratio; and the background 
of the business combination which indicates that praxair was the initiator of the business combination.
as praxair has historically prepared financial statement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united 
states ("u.s." or "usa")  ("u.s. gaap"), linde plc, as successor to praxair, has applied international financial reporting standard 1, 
first-time adoption of international financial reporting standards ("ifrs 1") to transition from those u.s. gaap financial statements 
to ifrs. see further discussion related to the adoption at note 29. the historical financial statements of praxair for the periods prior to 
the business combination are considered to be the historical financial statements of the company. the results of linde ag are included 
in linde's consolidated results from the date of the completion of the business combination forward. also, during 2018 the company 
reported its continuing operations in six reporting segments under which it managed its operations, assessed performance, and reported 
earnings: north america, south america, asia, europe, surface technologies and linde ag. linde ag became the sixth reportable 
segment effective with the merger on 31 october 2018.
linde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide. it continues to be a major technological innovator in the industrial gases 
industry. its primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and rare gases) and process 
gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, and acetylene). linde serves a diverse group of industries 
including healthcare, petroleum refining, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals 
and water treatment. the company also designs, engineers, and builds equipment that produces industrial gases primarily for internal use 
and offers its customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation 
plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants.  the surface technologies segment supplies wear-resistant and high-
temperature corrosion-resistant metallic and ceramic coatings and powders. 
the parent company is linde plc, an incorporated public limited company formed under the laws of ireland. linde plc’s registered 
office (registration  number 602527) is located at ten earlsfort terrace, dublin 2, d02 t380 ireland. linde plc’s principal executive 
offices are located at the priestley centre, 10 priestley road, surrey research park, guildford, surrey gu2 7xy, united kingdom.
the consolidated financial statements of linde for the year ended 31 december 2018 have been prepared in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards ("ifrs") issued by the international accounting standards board ("iasb") as adopted by 
the european union pursuant to eu regulation no. 1606/2002 of the european parliament and the council on the application of 
international accounting standards in the european union. the consolidated financial statements have also been prepared in accordance 
with the provisions of the irish companies act ("companies act 2014"), as applicable to companies reporting under ifrs. 
the consolidated financial statements of linde have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following: 1) certain 
financial assets and liabilities - measured at fair value 2) certain assets and disposal groups held for sale acquired in a business combination- 
measured at fair value less costs to sell and 3) defined benefit pension plans - plans assets measured at fair value.
the reporting currency is the us dollar ("usd"). all amounts are shown in millions of us dollars ($ million), unless stated otherwise. 
expenses are presented by function in the consolidated income statement.
the annual financial statements of companies included in the consolidation are prepared at the same reporting date as the annual 
financial statements of linde plc.
51
the consolidated financial statements of linde plc and subsidiaries were authorized for issue by the board of directors on 30 april  
2019. the board of directors has the power to amend and reissue financial statements. 
 [2] business combinations
merger of praxair, inc. and linde ag
in connection with the business combination, the company, praxair and linde ag entered into various agreements with regulatory 
authorities to satisfy anti-trust requirements to secure approval to consummate the business combination. these agreements included 
the sale of the majority of praxair’s european businesses (subsequently completed on 3 december 2018), the majority of linde ag’s 
america’s business (subsequently completed on 1 march 2019), as well as certain divestitures of other praxair and linde ag 
businesses in asia that are expected to be sold in 2019 (collectively, the “merger-related divestitures”). see note 3 for additional 
information relating to merger-related divestitures.
to obtain merger approval in the united states ("u.s.") linde, praxair and linde ag entered into an agreement with the u.s. 
federal trade commission dated 1 october 2018 (“hold separate order” or “hso”). under the hso, the company, praxair and linde 
ag agreed to (i) continue to operate linde ag and praxair as independent, ongoing, economically viable, competitive businesses held 
separate, distinct, and apart from each other’s operations; (ii) not coordinate any aspect of the operations of linde ag and praxair, 
including the marketing or sale of any products; and (iii) maintain separate financial ledgers, books, and records that report on a 
periodic basis, consistent with past practices, the assets, liabilities, expenses, revenues, and income of each, until certain divestitures in 
the united states have been completed. the restrictions under the hold separate order were lifted 1 march 2019, concurrent with the 
sale of the required merger-related divestitures in the united states.
in connection with the business combination, each share of common stock of praxair, inc. par value $0.01, (excluding any 
shares  held in treasury immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which were automatically canceled and retired for no 
consideration) was converted into the one share of common stock, par value €0.001 per share, of linde plc common stock.  
additionally, each tendered share of common stock of linde ag was converted into 1.54 shares of linde plc common stock. 
as provided in the business combination agreement, at the effective time of the business combination outstanding praxair stock 
options and other equity awards were generally converted into stock options and equity awards on a 1:1 basis with respect to linde 
shares.  outstanding linde ag share-based compensation awards were either settled in cash (for the portion vested), or are required to 
be converted into similar stock options and equity awards with respect to linde shares (for the portion unvested), after giving effect to 
the 1.54 exchange ratio.  this grant is expected to occur in the first half of 2019.  see notes 17 and 23 for additional information.
preliminary allocation of purchase price
in accordance with the iasb's ifrs 3, business combinations, praxair was determined to be the accounting acquirer. as such, 
the company has applied the acquisition method of accounting with respect to the identifiable assets and liabilities of linde ag, which 
have been measured at fair value as of the date of the business combination.
in accordance with the business combination agreement, linde ag shareholders that accepted the exchange offer received 
linde plc common shares in exchange for linde ag shares at an exchange ratio of 1.54 linde plc shares for each linde ag share.  
because praxair is the accounting acquirer, the fair value of the equity issued by linde plc to linde ag shareholders in the exchange 
transaction was determined by reference to the market price of praxair shares. accordingly, the purchase consideration below reflects 
the estimated fair value of the 92% of linde ag shares tendered and linde plc shares issued in exchange for those linde ag shares, 
which is based on the final closing price of praxair shares prior to the effective time of the merger on 31 october 2018 of $164.50 per 
share. 
52
the purchase price and estimated fair value of linde ag’s net assets acquired as if the merger date on 31 october 2018 is 
presented as follows: 
(in thousands, except value per share data, linde ag exchange ratio, and purchase price)
linde ag common stock tendered as of 31 october 2018 (i) 170,875 shares
business combination agreement exchange ratio (ii) 1.54 : 1
linde plc ordinary shares issued in exchange for linde ag 263,148
per share price of praxair, inc. common stock (iii) $164.50
purchase price (millions of dollars) $43,288
(i) number of linde ag shares tendered in the exchange offer.
(ii) exchange ratio for linde ag shares as set forth in the business combination agreement.
(iii) closing price of praxair shares on the new york stock exchange prior to the effective time of the business combination
on 31 october 2018.
in accordance with ifrs 3, linde ag's assets and liabilities were measured at estimated fair values at 31 october 2018, 
primarily using level 3 inputs, except debt which was level 1. fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an 
asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  fair value was 
estimated using management's best estimate of assumptions about future events and uncertainties, including significant judgments 
related to future cash flows (sales, costs, customer attrition rates, and contributory asset charges), discount rates, competitive trends, 
market data input factors, and others.  inputs used were generally obtained from historical data supplemented by current and 
anticipated market conditions and growth rates.   
the following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed by linde, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of linde ag’s net assets recorded as goodwill.  at 31 
december 2018, the valuation process to determine the fair values is not complete.  the company estimated the preliminary fair value 
of net assets acquired based on information currently available and will continue to adjust those estimates as additional information 
becomes available, analysis is able to be performed, upon refinement of market participant assumptions and finalization of tax returns 
in the pre-merger period.  the determination of preliminary fair values are substantially complete with the exception of identifiable 
intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, income taxes and goodwill. due to the timing of the close of the merger to 31 
december 2018, the hso which has deferred integration, and the magnitude of the net assets acquired, further adjustments are 
expected into 2019.  as the company finalizes the fair value of net assets acquired, additional purchase price allocation adjustments 
may be recorded during the measurement period, but no later than one year from the date of the acquisition. the company will reflect 
measurement period adjustments, if any, in the period in which the adjustments are determined.  
53
therefore, final determination of the fair values may result in further adjustments to the values presented in the following table: 
estimated fair
value of assets
millions of dollars and liabilities
goodwill $ 24,025
intangible assets 16,689
tangible assets 20,375
investments in associated and joint ventures (at equity) 493

non-current assets $ 62,596
inventories 1,460
trade receivables 2,711
other assets 1,347
cash 1,431
assets classified as held for sale 5,348
current assets $ 12,297
total assets $ 74,893
equity acquired equals purchase price paid (i) $ 43,288
noncontrolling interest 5,774
total equity 49,062
provisions for pensions and similar obligations 1,165
deferred tax liabilities 7,000

non-current liabilities $ 15,294
trade payables 3,007
current liabilities classified as held for sale 771
other current liabilities 6,759
current liabilities $ 10,537
total equity and liabilities $ 74,893
(i) see above for the calculation of the purchase price.
summary of significant fair value methods
the methods used to determine the fair value of significant identifiable assets and liabilities included in the preliminary 
allocation of purchase price are discussed below.
inventories
acquired inventory is comprised of finished goods, work in process and raw materials. the fair value of finished goods was 
calculated as the estimated selling price, adjusted for costs of the selling effort and a reasonable profit allowance relating to the selling 
effort. the fair value of work in process inventory was primarily calculated as the estimated selling price, adjusted for estimated costs 
to complete the manufacturing, estimated costs of the selling effort, as well as a reasonable profit margin on the remaining 
manufacturing and selling effort. the fair value of raw materials and supplies was determined based on replacement cost which 
approximates historical carrying value. the preliminary fair value step-up of inventories is being recognized in “cost of sales” as the 
inventory is sold. 
assets classified as held for sale and liabilities classified as held for sale
as a condition of the european commission ("ec"), the u.s. department of justice ("doj"), and other governmental regulatory 
authorities approval of the merger, linde plc, praxair and linde ag were required to divest various businesses in europe, the 
americas and asia. the fair value of these businesses has been determined based on the estimated net selling prices or sales 
agreements. actual amounts may differ from this preliminary determination. see note 3 for further information on merger-related 
divestitures.
54
property, plant and equipment
the fair value of property, plant and equipment was primarily calculated using replacement costs adjusted for the age and 
condition of the asset.
 identifiable intangible assets
the fair value estimate for all identifiable intangible assets is based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing 
an asset, based on the most advantageous market for the asset (i.e., its highest and best use).  the final fair value determination for 
identifiable intangibles or estimates of remaining useful lives may differ materially from this preliminary determination.
the fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset was valued using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of 
the income approach, which incorporates the estimated future cash flows to be generated from linde ag’s existing customer base. 
excess earnings are the earnings remaining after deducting the market rates of return on the estimated values of contributory assets, 
including debt-free net working capital, tangible assets, and other identifiable intangible assets. the excess earnings are thereby 
calculated for each year of multi-year projection periods and discounted to present value.
brands/tradenames includes the "linde" brand which is considered to have an indefinite life. the brand has been long 
established and will continue to be used as the name for the merged company. the linde brand has been used and in existence for 
many years, demonstrating proven value over that period. the brand name continues to have a strong market presence and there are no 
material legal, contractual, or other factors that limit its useful life. based on an analysis of these relevant factors there is no 
foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate cash inflows. other intangibles primarily includes acquired 
technology.  these intangible assets were valued using the relief from royalty method under the income approach; this method 
estimates the cost savings generated by a company related to the ownership of an asset for which it would otherwise have had to pay 
royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset and discounted to present value.
pension and other postretirement liabilities
linde recognized a pretax net liability representing the unfunded portion of linde ag’s defined-benefit pension and other 
postretirement benefit ("opeb") plans. refer to note 18 for further information on pensions and opeb arrangements.
long-term debt
the fair value for long-term debt was primarily obtained from third party quotes, as the majority of the linde ag bond portfolio 
is publicly traded.  
deferred income tax assets and liabilities
the deferred income tax assets and liabilities include the expected future u.s. federal, u. s. state and non-u.s. ("foreign") tax 
consequences associated with temporary differences between the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
and the respective tax bases. tax rates utilized in calculating deferred income taxes generally represent the enacted or substantially 
enacted statutory tax rates at the effective date of the merger in the jurisdictions in which legal title of the underlying asset or liability 
resides.  the final fair value of deferred income tax assets and liabilities may differ from this preliminary determination. 
refer to note 10 for further information related to income taxes. 
equity investments
the fair value of equity investments was determined using a discounted cash flow approach. the final fair value of equity investments 
may differ from this preliminary determination. 
other assets acquired and liabilities assumed (excluding goodwill) 
linde utilized the carrying values, net of allowances, to value accounts and notes receivable and accounts payable as well as other 
current assets and liabilities as it was determined that carrying values represented the fair value of those items at the merger date.  
receivables were acquired mainly in the form of trade receivables. the gross contractual amount of these trade receivables was 
$3,147 million, fair value was determined to be $2,711 million. the difference of $436 million between fair value of the trade 
receivables and the contractual amount equals the contractual cash flows expected not to be collected. 
no contingent liabilities have been identified so far. 
55
goodwill
the excess of the consideration for the merger over the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. 
the merger resulted in the recognition of $24,025 million of goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes.  the goodwill balance 
is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce, expanded market opportunities and cost and other operating synergies anticipated 
upon the integration of the operations of praxair and linde ag.
noncontrolling interests
noncontrolling interests include the fair value of noncontrolling interests of linde ag, including approximately $3.2 billion 
relating to the 8% of linde ag shares which were not tendered in the exchange offer and are intended to be the subject of a cash-
merger squeeze-out.  the company’s wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, linde intermediate holding ag ("linde holding"), which 
directly owns the 92% of linde ag shares acquired in the exchange offer, determined the adequate cash compensation to be paid to 
the 8% remaining linde ag minority shareholders in exchange for the transfer of their linde ag shares for each linde ag share. the 
cash-merger squeeze-out was approved by the shareholders of linde ag at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of linde ag on 12 
december 2018, and was effectuated at 8 april 2019.  the remaining noncontrolling interests relate to the fair value of historic 
noncontrolling interests of linde ag and its subsidiaries. fair value of the remaining noncontrolling interest was determined using a 
discounted cash flow approach that accounts for entity-specific risk situations as well as discounts for lack of marketability. the final 
fair value determination for noncontrolling interests may differ from this preliminary determination. the company recognizes 
noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired 
entity’s net identifiable assets. this decision is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. for this business combination the 
company has elected to recognize non controlling interest at fair value. see note 6 for the company's accounting policies for business 
combinations.  
results of linde ag operations since merger
the results of operations of linde ag have been included in the company’s consolidated statements of income since the merger. 
the following table provides linde ag “sales from continuing operations” and “profit for the year from continuing operations” 
included in the company's results since the merger.
linde ag results of operations since merger
1 november  - 31
(millions of dollars) december 2018
revenues from continuing operations $ 3,019
profit (loss) from continuing operations* $ (432)
*  includes charges related to the impacts of acquisition ("purchase") accounting.
proforma information
below are the full year consolidated proforma results of linde plc presented as though the acquisition date for the business 
combination was at 1 january 2018.
linde plc proforma results of operations
1 january - 31
(millions of dollars) december 2018
revenues from continuing operations $ 30,026
profit (loss) from continuing operations $ 4,497
these amounts have been calculated using the subsidiary’s results and adjusting them for $2,183 million of additional 
depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets had applied from 1 january 2018, together with the consequential tax effects.
significant nonrecurring amounts reflected in the proforma results are as follows:
a $3.8 billion gain ($3.4 billion after tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter 2018 as a result of the divestiture of praxair's 
european industrial gases business and is included in the 31 december 2018 proforma profit from continuing operations.  
56
for the year ended 31 december 2018, praxair, inc. and linde ag collectively incurred pre-tax costs of $579 million, recorded 
in administration expenses, to prepare for and close the merger. these merger costs were reflected within the results of operations in 
the proforma results as incurred. 
the company also incurred pre-tax charges of $368 million ($279 million after tax) and $10 million ($8 million after tax) in 
2018 related to the fair value step up of inventories acquired and sold as well as a pension settlement due to the payout to certain 
participants as a result of change in control provisions within a u.s. nonqualified pension plan, respectively. the 2018 proforma 
results include these charges. see note 18 for further information relating to the u.s. nonqualified pension plan settlements.       
acquisition-related costs
acquisition-related costs of $236 million for 2018 (2017:$52 million) are included in administration expense in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss in the operating cash flows in the statement of cash flow.
2018 non-merger related acquisitions
non-merger related acquisitions of $25 million during the year ended 31 december 2018 are not material individually or in the 
aggregate.
2017 acquisitions
during the year ended 31 december 2017, linde had acquisitions totaling $33 million, primarily acquisitions of packaged gas 
businesses and a carbon dioxide joint venture in north america. these transactions resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets of 
$24 million and $3 million, respectively (see note 12). 
[3] merger-related divestitures, discontinued operations and assets held for sale
as a condition of the european commission ("ec"), the u.s. department of justice ("doj"), and other governmental regulatory 
authorities approval of the merger, linde plc, praxair and linde ag were required to divest the following businesses:
praxair merger-related divestitures - primarily european industrial gases business 
as a condition of the ec regulatory approval of the merger transaction, praxair agreed to sell the majority of its industrial gases 
business in europe.  the sale was completed by 3 december 2018 in two transactions, as described below: 
•  the società italiana acetilene e derivati s.p.a. ("siad") sale and purchase agreement ("spa") dated 5 december 
2017 whereby praxair agreed, inter alia, to sell its 34% non-controlling participation in its italian joint venture siad 
to its joint venture partner flow fin in exchange for flow fin’s 40% non-controlling participation in praxair’s 
consolidated subsidiary, rivoira s.p.a., and payment of a net purchase price of  €90 million ($102 million as of 31 
october 2018) by praxair to flow fin.  this transaction was completed on 31 october 2018 and;
•  the praxair europe sale and purchase agreement dated 5 july 2018 pursuant to which praxair sold the majority of its 
european businesses to taiyo nippon sanso corporation for €5 billion in cash consideration ($5.7 billion at 3 december 
2018), reduced by normal closing adjustments of €86 million ($96 million).  these transactions were completed on 3 
december 2018.
in connection with these transactions, the company recognized a net pre-tax gain of $3.8 billion ($3.4 billion after tax) in the 
consolidated statements of profit and loss as part of the net gain on divestiture of businesses.
57
the net carrying value of praxair's european business assets and liabilities divested on 3 december 2018 is presented below:
(millions of dollars) carrying value
tangible assets $ 1,342
investments in associates and joint ventures (at equity) 234
goodwill 620
other intangible assets 115
other receivables and other assets 36
total non-current assets 2,347
cash and cash equivalents $ 38
trade receivables 311
inventories 67
other receivables and other assets 22
total current assets $ 438
total assets divested $ 2,785
financial liabilities 2
other non-current liabilities 92
deferred tax liabilities 174
total non-current liabilities $ 268
trade payables 215
income tax liabilities 27
other current liabilities 111
total current liabilities $ 353
total liabilities divested $ 621
noncontrolling interests $ 200
pension/opeb funded status obligation, net of taxes (8)
cumulative translation adjustment, net of taxes 165
net assets divested $ 1,807
the divestiture of the interests in the businesses in europe sold to taiyo nippon sanso corporation (including the transaction 
with siad) do not represent a disposal of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.  the net gain on the 
divestment has been recorded in profit and loss from continuing operations.  this reflects the position that post the merger and 
divestiture the company continues to operate in europe as part of the emea business (see note 26).
discontinued operations and assets held for sale
additionally, to satisfy regulatory requirements to consummate the business combination, praxair agreed to the following
transactions which will be completed during 2019: 
•  praxair's chilean business which will be sold as part of the americas' spa (as defined below) for $21 million proceeds 
which is further described below.
•  various transactions within china, india and south korea.   
•  2018 sales related to these businesses were approximately $160 million.
effective 22 october 2018, the date of final regulatory approvals, these businesses have been accounted for as non-current 
assets held for sale on the consolidated statement of financial position.  these businesses were evaluated for discontinued operations 
accounting treatment under ifrs and it was determined that they did not meet the definition of a discontinued operation as these 
transactions did not represent a disposal of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, after considering the 
impact of the merger.    
58
linde ag merger-related divestitures - primarily americas industrial gases business 
as a condition of the u.s. regulatory approval of the merger, linde ag agreed to sell the majority of its industrial gases 
business in the americas, as described below: 
•  the linde ag americas sales and purchase agreement, dated 16 july 2018, as and further amended on 22 september 
2018, 19 october 2018, and 20 february 2019 whereby linde ag and praxair, inc. entered into an agreement with a 
consortium comprising companies of the german industrial gases manufacturer messer group and cvc capital partners 
fund vii to sell the majority of linde ag’s industrial gases business in north america and certain industrial gases 
business activities of linde ag's in south america for $2.97 billion in cash consideration after purchase price 
adjustments for certain items relating to assets and liabilities of the sold businesses. in addition, divestitures include $531 
million of proceeds for incremental plant sales within the americas under other agreements. these transactions were 
completed on 1 march 2019.
•  various transactions within china, india and south korea.
only the sales of the linde ag merger-related divested subsidiaries meet the criteria for discontinued operations, under ifrs as 
they were acquired with a view to being sold, and so related earnings are included within profit for the year from discontinued operations, 
net of tax for periods subsequent to the merger, as summarized below: 
(millions of dollars) 1 november  - 31
december 2018
net sales $ 340
cost of sales 141
other operating costs 92
operating profit 107
income tax expense 9
profit for the year from discontinued operations $ 98
for the year ended 31 december 2018 there were no material amounts of depreciation, amortization, capital expenditures, or 
significant operating or investing non-cash items related to discontinued operations.
assets held for sales includes both the linde ag merger-related divestitures that meet the criteria for discontinued operations  
and the praxair merger-related divestitures that do not. as of 31 december 2018 the following assets and liabilities are reported as 
components of the net assets held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial position:
carrying / fair
(millions of dollars) market value

[4] scope of consolidation
the following table provides the structure of companies included in the consolidated financial statements:
as at 31/12/2017 additions disposals as at 31/12/2018
consolidated subsidiaries 207 561 51 717
companies accounted for as a joint operation 0 7 0 7
companies accounted for using the equity method 93 33 71 55
changes in the scope of the consolidation may arise as a result of acquisitions, sales, mergers or closures or as a result of changes 
in the assessment as to whether linde plc exercises control or joint control.
[5] foreign currency translation
the consolidated financial statements are presented in usd currency units , which is the company's functional and presentation 
currency. 
items included in the financial statements of each of the company's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates ("the functional currency"). transactions in foreign currency are translated into the relevant 
functional currency of the individual entity on the transaction date. after initial recognition, foreign currency fluctuations relating to 
monetary items are recognized in profit and loss. foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings are presented in the statement 
of profit and loss, within finance costs. all other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss on a net basis within other operating income/expense. for non-monetary items, historical translation rates form the measurement 
basis.
translation differences arising from the translation of items into the reporting currency are recognized in other comprehensive 
income. the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, including any fair value adjustments identified during a purchase price allocation, 
that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency in accordance with 
ias 21, the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
assets and liabilities, contingent liabilities, and other financial commitments are translated at the mid-rate on the reporting date 
(closing rate method). items in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for the year are translated at a rate which approximates to 
the translation rate on the date of the transaction (the average rate). 
foreign exchange gains and losses are deferred in equity if they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment 
hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation. during the years ended 31 december 2018 and 2017, the 
company recognized $105 million and $242 million, respectively, of gains in net investment hedges in the statement of comprehensive 
income within currency translation adjustments.
the financial statements of foreign companies accounted for using the equity method are translated using the same principles for 
the adjustment of equity as are applied to consolidated subsidiaries.
in general, the financial statements of subsidiaries which report in a functional currency which is the currency of a hyperinflationary 
economy are adjusted for the change in purchasing power arising from the inflation in accordance with ias 29, financial reporting in 
hyperinflationary economies.

[6] accounting policies 
this note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
to the extent they have not already been disclosed in the other notes. these policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated.
the financial statements of companies included in the consolidated financial statements of linde have been prepared using uniform 
accounting policies in accordance with ifrs 10, consolidated financial statements ("ifrs 10").
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with ifrs requires management judgments and estimates 
for some items, which might have an impact on their recognition and measurement in the consolidated statement of financial position 
and consolidated statement of profit and loss. the actual amounts realized may differ from these estimates.
the primary accounting and valuation policies, as well as the estimates and management judgments associated with them, are 
explained below:
principles of consolidation
consolidation
the consolidated financial statements comprise linde and all the companies over which linde is able to exercise control as defined 
by ifrs 10. 
control is achieved when linde has power over the investee, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with 
the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. if linde plc holds a majority of the voting 
rights in a company, this typically indicates that it exercises control over the company in the absence of any other restrictive contractual 
agreements. subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the data on which control is transferred to the company.  they are deconsolidated 
from the date the control ceases.
intra-company sales, income and expenses and accounts receivable and payable are eliminated. intra-company profits and losses 
arising from intra-company deliveries of non-current assets and inventories are also eliminated. accounting policies of subsidiaries have 
been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the company.
61
noncontrolling interests
 noncontrolling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of financial 
position. 
joint arrangements
linde has several joint arrangements in which it has joint control with one or several parties through a contractual agreement. if 
joint control exists, linde needs to distinguish whether the investment is a joint operation or a joint venture. this distinction is dependent 
on whether linde has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement or whether it has rights to the net assets of 
the arrangement. to make the distinction, linde considers the structure and legal form of the arrangement, any contractual agreements 
which might apply and any other relevant circumstances.
significant influence
associates over which linde plc can exercise significant influence as defined by ias 28, investments in associates and joint 
ventures are also accounted for using the equity method. significant influence is presumed if linde holds (directly or indirectly) 20 
percent or more of the voting rights in an investee. 
joint ventures
investments in associates and  joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method at cost at the date of acquisition. in subsequent 
periods, the carrying amount is adjusted up or down to reflect linde’s share of the total comprehensive income of the investee. any 
distributions received from the investee and other changes in the investee’s equity reduce or increase the carrying amount of the investment. 
if the losses of an associate or joint venture attributable to linde equal or exceed the value of the interest held in this associate or joint 
venture, no further losses are recognised unless linde incurs an obligation or makes payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. 
the same principles apply to companies accounted for using the equity method as for the consolidation of subsidiaries.
investments in associates and  joint ventures are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances reflect that an impairment 
may have occurred. 
joints operations
if the joint arrangement qualifies as joint operation, linde recognizes the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its 
interest in a joint operation in accordance with the ifrs's applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
other investments
other investments, when taken individually and together, are immaterial from linde’s point of view in terms of total assets, revenue 
and profit and loss for the year and do not have a significant impact on the consolidated net assets, financial position and results of 
operations of linde. 
change in ownership interests
linde treats transactions with noncontrolling interests that do not result in a loss of control as equity transactions. where 
noncontrolling interests are acquired, any remaining balance between the acquisition cost and the share of net assets acquired is offset 
directly in equity. intra-company sales, income and expenses and accounts receivable and payable are eliminated.
when linde loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes: the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any related noncontrolling 
interests and other components of equity. any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit and loss. any interest retained in the former 
subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. 
when linde ceases to consolidate (or account for as an equity method investment) an investment because of a loss of control, 
joint control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value when control is lost. any 
resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit and loss. in addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income 
in related to that entity are accounted for as if the company had directly (or partially) disposed of the related assets or liabilities. this 
may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit and loss.
62
management judgments in relation to control
when assessing whether linde exercises control, joint control or significant influence over companies in which it holds less than 
100 percent of the voting rights, management judgment is required to assess whether it controls the investee. in addition, companies are 
fully consolidated if linde exerts increased management authority in those companies and is able to exercise the most extensive decision-
making powers over major portions of the operating activities of the entities.
changes to contractual agreements or facts or circumstances are monitored on an ongoing basis and are evaluated to determine 
whether they have an impact on the assessment as to whether linde is exercising control or joint control over its investment.
business combinations
business combinations require estimates to be made when determining fair values. when discounted cash flow methods are used, 
discretionary aspects include in particular the time period and amount of the cash flow and the determination of an appropriate discount 
rate. in connection with management judgments about purchase price allocations in the case of significant business combinations, linde 
may utilize external valuation services.
 acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method. the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets 
acquired, and liabilities assumed.  any excess of the purchase price, and noncontrolling interests recognized over the fair value of the 
net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. allocations of the purchase price are initially based on 
preliminary estimates and assumptions at the date of acquisition and are subject to revision based on final information received, 
including appraisals and other analyses which support underlying estimates. 
the company recognizes noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. this decision is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. 
if the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are 
recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss.
intangible assets
intangible assets are stated at acquisition cost or manufacturing cost less accumulated amortization and any impairment losses. an 
intangible asset is recognized if it can be identified as an asset, if it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to 
the asset will flow to linde, and if the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. it is important to determine whether the intangible assets 
have finite or indefinite useful lives. the estimated useful life of customer relationships purchased is calculated on the basis of the term 
of the contractual relationship underlying the customer relationship, or on the basis of expected customer behavior. goodwill, intangible 
assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet ready for use are not amortized, but are subject instead to an impairment 
test once a year, or more often if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. other intangible assets are tested for impairment 
whenever events, or changes in circumstances, indicate that the asset may be impaired.
the "linde" brandname is considered to have an indefinite useful life. the brand has been long established and will continue to 
be used as the name for the merged company. the linde brand has been used and in existence for many years, demonstrating proven 
value over that period. the brand name continues to have a strong market presence and there are no material legal, contractual, or 
other factors that limit its useful life. based on an analysis of these relevant factors there is no foreseeable limit to the period over 
which the asset is expected to generate cash inflows.
in a business combination, goodwill is initially measured at cost, which is the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred 
and the fair value of net assets (including noncontrolling interests) acquired. after initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. goodwill is tested for impairment annually, in the financial year of acquisition, if later,  or more 
frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. the company performs the annual 
impairment testing in the second quarter. 
goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the company's cash-generating units 
("cgus") that are expected to benefit from the combination. the impairment review of goodwill is performed for groups of cgus, i.e. 
each of the business units: linde ag, us packaged gas, us industrial gases, mexico, canada, south america, europe, asia, and surface 
technologies, as management monitors goodwill at that level during the reporting period presented.
63
impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each group of cgus to which the goodwill is 
allocated to. where the recoverable amount of the group of cgus is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. the 
recoverable amount is determined as the group of cgu’s fair value less costs to sell. if the carrying amount of the group of cgus exceeds 
or is close to the fair value less costs to sell, a test is performed to determine whether the value in use is higher than the carrying amount. 
in order to determine the fair value of the group of cgus, the company utilizes a market multiples approach, multiplying the earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization ("ebitda") of each group of cgu’s by an ebitda multiple. impairment losses 
relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. 
if the reason for an impairment loss recognised in prior years no longer exists, the carrying amount of the intangible asset is increased 
to a maximum figure of the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised. 
costs incurred in connection with the purchase of software or in-house development of software used internally, including the costs 
of bringing this software to an operational state, are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis.
the useful lives of intangible assets are:
intangible asset classification weighted average amortization period
customer relationships 27 years
linde brand indefinite useful life
brands / tradenames 27 years
other intangible assets 8 years
tangible assets
tangible assets are reported at acquisition cost or manufacturing cost less accumulated depreciation based on the estimated useful 
life of the asset and any impairment losses. tangible assets are depreciated using the straight-line method, and the depreciation expense 
is disclosed in the consolidated statement of profit and loss under the heading which corresponds to the functional features of the underlying 
asset. 
the depreciation method and the estimated useful lives of the assets are reviewed on an annual basis and adapted to prevailing 
conditions.
the following useful lives apply to the different types of tangible assets:
depreciable
lives (yrs)
production plants (primarily 15-year life) 10-20
storage tanks 15-20
transportation equipment and other 3-15
cylinders 10-30
buildings 25-40
land and improvements 0-20
the useful lives are estimated based on past experience. assumptions also need to be made when linde assesses whether an asset 
may be capitalized and which components of the cost of the asset may be capitalised. estimates need to be made here, for example, of 
the expected future economic benefits of an asset or the expected future costs of the dismantling of plants. in addition, the capitalization 
of costs which are incurred during the operating phase of an asset, such as the costs of upgrades to plants or their complete overhaul, 
depends on whether these costs will lead to better or higher output or whether they extend the estimated useful life of the asset. the 
company capitalizes borrowing cost as part of the cost of constructing major facilities. 
if significant events or market developments indicate an impairment in the value of the tangible or intangible asset, linde reviews 
the recoverability of the carrying amount of the asset by testing for impairment. the impairment test is performed at the cgu level to 
which the asset belongs. a cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows from external 
parties that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets. in identifying whether cash inflows are largely independent, 
64
linde considers various factors including how management monitors the operations and how management makes decisions about 
continuing or disposing of the entity's assets and operations. the recoverable amount of the cgu is calculated, which is the higher of its 
fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. linde typically uses value in use. to determine the value in use, estimated future 
cash flows are discounted at a rate which reflects the risk specific to the cgu. when estimating future cash flows, segment specific, 
technological, economic and general developments are taken into account. if the reason for an impairment loss recognized in prior years 
no longer exists, the carrying amount of the tangible asset is increased to the new recoverable amount, but not exceeding the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized.
inventories
inventories are reported at the lower of acquisition or manufacturing cost and net realizable value. cost is determined using the 
average-cost method. 
non-current assets classified as held for sale, and discontinued operations
non-current assets, as well as liabilities directly related to these, are classified separately in the consolidated statement of financial 
position as held for sale if they are available for sale in their present condition and the sale within the next twelve months is highly 
probable.
non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. amortization 
and depreciation are discontinued from the date on which the non-current assets are classified as held for sale. the process involved in 
determining the fair value less costs to sell involves estimates and assumptions that are subject to uncertainty.
discontinued operations are reported when a part of the business is classified as held for sale, or has already been disposed of, and 
the business area in question represents either a separate major line of business or a geographical area of operations, or is part of a single 
coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively 
with a view to resale. the profit/loss from discontinued operations is reported separately from the expenses and income from continuing 
operations in the consolidated statement of profit and loss; prior-year figures are shown on a like-for-like basis. in the consolidated 
statement of cash flows, the cash flows from discontinued operations are shown separately from the cash flows from continuing operations; 
prior-year figures are shown on a like-for-like basis. if the information relates exclusively to discontinued operations, this is highlighted 
accordingly.
provisions for pensions and similar obligations
the valuation of pension provisions is based on the projected unit credit method set out in ias 19, employee benefits  ("ias 19") 
for defined benefit obligations. this method takes into account not only vested future benefits and known pensions at the reporting date, 
but also expected future increases in salaries and pensions. the calculation of the provisions is determined using actuarial reports.
the fair value of the plan assets is deducted from the present value of the pension obligations (gross pension obligation) to give the 
net pension obligation or net pension asset in respect of defined benefit pension plans. the net pension asset is adjusted if necessary to 
comply with the rules relating to the asset ceiling set out in ias 19.64. according to ias 19.64, a net pension asset may only be disclosed 
if linde, under its obligation as an employer, has the right to receive a refund of the surplus or to reduce future contributions.
the net interest expense for the financial year is calculated by multiplying the net pension obligation or net pension asset at the 
beginning of the period by the interest rate underlying the discounting of the gross defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the 
period.
the discount rate is calculated on the basis of the returns achieved on the relevant call date for high quality fixed-interest corporate 
bonds in the market. the currency and period to maturity of the underlying bonds correspond to the currency and probable period to 
maturity of the post-employment benefit obligations. if such returns are not available, the discount rates are based on market returns for 
government bonds.
remeasurements comprise of the actuarial gains and losses on the remeasurement of the gross defined benefit obligation and the 
difference between the return on plan assets actually realized and the return assumed at the beginning of the period, which is based on 
the discount rate of the corresponding gross defined benefit obligation. if a pension plan is overfunded and the asset ceiling applies, 
remeasurements also comprise the change in the net asset from the application of the asset ceiling rules to the extent that this has not 
been accounted for in net interest.
65
actuarial gains and losses arise from changes in actuarial assumptions or from variations between earlier actuarial assumptions and 
actual events.
all remeasurements (i.e. actuarial gains and losses, the cumulative effect of an asset ceiling and the effects of an increase in the 
pension obligation in accordance with ifric 14, the limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their 
interaction) are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income.
the expense arising from additions to the pension provisions resulting from service during the period and past service costs are 
allocated to functional costs. the net interest expense or net interest income from defined benefit plans is disclosed in the financial result. 
for each pension plan, it is established whether the net figure is a net interest expense or net interest income and the amounts are disclosed 
accordingly in the financial result.
miscellaneous provisions
in accordance with ias 37, provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, miscellaneous provisions are recognised when 
a present obligation to a third party exists as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle 
the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
miscellaneous provisions are recognised for all identifiable risks and liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. the amounts provided 
are the best estimate of the probable expenditure required to settle the obligation and are not offset against recourse claims. the settlement 
amount is calculated based on the assessment of the probability of an outflow of resources, and on past experience and the circumstances 
known at the reporting date. this also includes any cost increases which need to be taken into account at the reporting date. the actual 
outflow of resources at a future date may therefore vary from the figure included in other provisions. provisions which relate to periods 
of more than twelve months are discounted.
provisions include provisions for warranties, onerous contracts and provisions for litigation. assumptions are made here about the 
probability of occurrence of the risk and the expected future outflow of resources. the uncertainty associated with the measurement of 
warranty provisions is relatively moderate, as linde has recourse to historical warranty cost ratios when determining the amounts to be 
set aside.
litigation is associated with great uncertainty. a degree of discretion is required to assess whether a present obligation to a third 
party exists at the reporting date as a result of a past event, whether it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required in future 
to settle the obligation and whether a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. the current status of outstanding 
litigation is regularly reviewed and updated by linde's legal department and lawyers appointed by linde. changes to this status as a 
result of new information may result in adjustments being made to the provision.
provisions for warranty claims are recognised taking current or estimated future claims experience into account.
dismantling provisions are capitalised when they arise, at the discounted value of the obligation, and a provision for the same 
amount is established at the same time. an estimate is made, based on past experience, of future costs expected to be incurred to dismantle 
plants and restore the land on which the plant was built to its original condition. the expected costs are reassessed on an annual basis 
and the amount of the provision is adjusted if required. the depreciation charged on the asset and the unwinding of interest applied to 
the provision are both allocated as an expense to the periods of use of the asset.
provisions for restructuring are recognised if a formal, detailed restructuring plan has been drawn up and communicated to the 
relevant parties.
income tax provisions are disclosed in income tax liabilities.
revenue recognition
revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an 
amount that reflects the consideration to which linde expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. if the consideration 
in a contract includes a variable amount, linde estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring 
the goods to the customer. the variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and is recognized only when it is highly probable 
that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the associated uncertainty with 
the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
66
revenue is recognized at a point in time or over time depending on when control is transferred for each individual contract  (see 
note 7).
linde pays sales commission to its employees for each contract that they obtain for bundled sales of equipment and installation 
services.
linde has elected to apply the optional practical expedient for costs to obtain a contract which allows linde to immediately expense 
sales commissions (included under employee benefits and part of marketing and selling expense) because the amortization period of the 
asset that linde otherwise would have used is one year or less.
cost of sales
cost of sales comprises the cost of goods and services sold and the cost of merchandise sold. it includes not only the cost of direct 
materials and direct manufacturing expenses, but also overheads including depreciation of production plants, amortization of certain 
intangible assets and inventory write-downs. 
research and development costs
research costs and development costs which cannot be capitalized are recognized immediately in profit and loss.
financial result
the financial result includes:
•  interest expenses on liabilities,
•  dividends received,
•  interest income on receivables,
•  gains and losses on financial instruments recognized in profit and loss,
•  the net interest expense and net interest income from defined benefit plans, and
•  interest expense and income from finance leases.
interest income and interest expenses are recognized in profit and loss on the basis of the effective interest rate method. dividends 
are recognized in profit and loss when they have been declared. 
financial instruments
financial assets and liabilities are only recognized in the statement of financial position when linde becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the financial instrument. in the normal course of events, purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for on settlement 
day. the same does not apply to derivatives, which are accounted for on the trading day.
the classification of financial instruments at initial recognition depends on their contractual terms and the business model for 
managing the instruments. 
financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as financial assets at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive 
income ("oci"), or fair value through profit and loss. linde did not elect the fair value option. linde measures financial assets at amortized 
cost if both, the business model and the solely payments of principal and interest ("sppi") test are met. debt instruments are measured 
at fair value through oci if both, the business model and the sppi test are met.  an entity can elect on an instrument-by-instrument basis 
to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at fair value through oci when they meet the definition 
of equity under ias 32, financial instruments: presentation and are not held for trading. linde did not elect to classify investments 
under this category. financial assets at fair value through profit and loss include equity investments and derivative financial assets unless 
they are designated as effective hedging instruments. linde trade receivables are generally recognized at amortized cost.
business model assessment 
the company determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its 
business objective.  
67
the company's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios 
that is based on observable factors. 
financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value. transaction expenses which are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or issue of financial instruments are only included in the determination of the carrying amount if the financial instruments are not recognized 
at fair value through profit and loss.
financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest ("eir") method and are subject to 
impairment. linde’s financial assets at amortized cost includes trade receivables, receivables from finance lease, loan receivables and 
other financial assets included under other assets. trade receivables are measured at the transaction price, the face value less impairment, 
if the receivables do not contain a significant financing component. management has considered factors such as the difference between 
the cash price for assets and transaction prices within its agreements, terms of its agreements and market interest rates. management has 
reviewed its current portfolio noting that its receivables do not contain significant financing components. 
the starting point of the impairment model for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables is an analysis of the actual 
historical default rates per business and product area, taking into account regional circumstances. these historical default rates are adjusted 
for the impact of current macroeconomic changes, if indicated, taking into account forward-looking information. furthermore, a critical 
review of the default rates takes place against the background of the expectations of the responsible management with regard to the 
realizability of the receivables.
expected credit losses ("ecls") s are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract 
and all the cash flows that the company expects to receive, discounted at the appropriate effective interest rate.  
the company considers a financial asset to be in default (credit impaired) when contractual payments are 360 days past due. however, 
in certain cases, the company may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the 
company is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts. a financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation 
of recovering the contractual cash flows.
a financial asset is derecognized if, it is settled,  linde loses its contractual entitlement to cash flows from such an asset or if it 
transfers virtually all the risks and opportunities associated with that financial asset. no financial assets that would not qualify for 
derecognition were transferred or sold to another party by linde.
all derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value, irrespective of their purpose or the reason for which they were acquired. 
embedded derivatives (i. e. derivatives which are included in host contracts) are separated from the host contract and accounted for as 
derivative financial instruments, if certain requirements are met.
for more information about risk management and the impact on the statement of financial position of derivative financial instruments, 
see note 24.
financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at amortized cost, at fair value through profit and loss, 
or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge. all financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value 
and, in the case of financial liabilities at amortized cost, net of directly attributable transaction costs. liabilities from finance leases, trade 
payables, financial debt, as well as miscellaneous liabilities, are reported at amortized cost as long as they are not derivative financial 
instruments. differences between historical cost and the repayment amount are accounted for using the effective interest rate method. 
the carrying amount of the financial debt which comprises the hedged item in a fair value hedge is adjusted for the corresponding gain 
or loss with respect to the hedged risk. a financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled 
or expires. 
financial liabilities which contain both an equity portion and a liability portion (commonly refer as “compound financial 
instruments”) are classified in accordance with ias 32. the financial instruments issued by linde are classified entirely as financial 
liabilities and reported at amortized cost. no compound financial instruments exist.
financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position 
if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize 
the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
income taxes
68
the income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the applicable 
income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and 
to unused tax losses. the current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end 
of the reporting period. management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulation is subject to interpretation. it establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the 
tax authorities.
deferred taxes
deferred tax assets and liabilities are accounted for in accordance with ias 12, income taxes under the liability method in respect 
of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities under ifrs and the corresponding tax base used 
in the computation of taxable profit, and in respect of all consolidation adjustments affecting net income and unused tax loss carryforwards.
deferred tax assets are only recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
in future years against which the tax losses can be utilized. deferred taxes are calculated at the tax rates that apply to the period when 
the asset is realized or the liability is settled, using tax rates set out in laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted in the individual 
countries by the reporting date.
the company evaluates deferred tax assets quarterly to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character 
(e.g., capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. after considering the positive and 
negative evidence, the company reduces the assets to their realizable value when management determines that it is probable (i.e., 
greater than 50% likelihood) that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
accounting for leases
according to ifric 4, determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, if specific criteria are met, certain arrangements 
should be accounted for as leases that do not take the legal form of a lease. in particular, in the gases division, certain gas supply contracts 
are classified as embedded leases if the fulfillment of the arrangement depends upon a specific asset and if the customer’s revenue share 
accounts for an overwhelming proportion of the production capacity of the asset. if an embedded lease exists, the criteria set out in ias 
17, leases are used to examine in each individual case whether, under the gas supply contract, substantially all the risks and rewards 
incidental to ownership of the plant have been transferred to the customer, meaning that this constitutes an embedded finance lease. this 
involves separating that portion of the gas supply contract which relates to the embedded lease from the rest of the contract. then it is 
established whether the minimum lease payments thus identified amount to substantially all the fair value of the plant and whether the 
minimum lease term is for the major part of the plant’s economic life.
when classifying procurement lease agreements, linde must also make assumptions: e.g. to determine the appropriate interest rate 
or the residual value or estimated useful lives of the underlying assets. if linde is the lessee under a finance lease agreement, the assets 
are disclosed at the beginning of the lease under tangible assets at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the 
future lease payments. corresponding liabilities from finance leases are recognised.
rental and lease payments under operating leases are recognised in functional costs in the consolidated statement of profit and loss 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
rounding of amounts 
all amounts disclosed in the financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million currency units unless 
otherwise stated.
new standards and interpretations that have not yet been adopted
the following standards have been issued by the iasb, but have not been applied in the consolidated financial statements of linde 
for the year ended 31 december 2018, as they are either not yet effective and/or have not yet been adopted by the european union:
•  ifrs 16, leases (first-time application according to iasb in financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2019)
•  ifric 23, uncertainty over income tax treatments (first-time application according to iasb in financial years beginning on 
or after 1 january 2019)
•  amendments to ifrs 9, prepayment features with negative compensation (first-time application according to iasb in financial 
years beginning on or after 1 january 2019)
69
•  amendments to ias 28, long-term interests in associates and joint ventures (first-time application according to iasb in 
financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2019)
•  amendments to ias 19, plan amendment, curtailment or settlement (first-time application according to iasb in financial years 
beginning on or after 1 january 2019)
•  amendments to ifrs 3, definition of a business (first-time application according to iasb in financial years beginning on or 
after 1 january 2020)
•  amendments to ias 1 and ias 8, definition of material (first-time application according to iasb in financial years beginning 
on or after 1 january 2020)
•  the conceptual framework for financial reporting (first-time application according to iasb in financial years beginning on 
or after 1 january 2020)
•  amendments to ifrs 10 and ias 28, sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture (in 
december 2015, the iasb postponed the effective date of this effective date of this amendment indefinitely pending the outcome 
of its research project on the equity method of accounting)
•  annual improvements to ifrs standards 2015 - 2017 cycle (first-time application according to iasb in financial years beginning 
on or after 1 january 2019)
  ifrs 3, business combinations - previously held interests in a joint operation
  ifrs 11, joint arrangements - previously held interests in a joint operation
  ias 12, income taxes - income tax consequences of payments on financial instruments classified as equity
  ias 23, borrowing costs - borrowing costs eligible for capitalization
ifrs 16
ifrs 16 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. the new standard now 
provides a single lessee accounting model requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is twelve 
months or less or the underlying asset has a low value (option in each case). lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance, 
with ifrs 16’s approach to lessor accounting substantially unchanged from its predecessor, ias 17.
linde enters into lease agreements principally as the lessee. the number of operating leases is much higher than the number of 
finance leases. as a result, the application of ifrs 16 will result in an increase in both assets and financial liabilities at linde. no significant 
impact on finance leases is expected. linde will make use of the options relating to short-term and low-value leases. as far as the 
transitional requirements are concerned, linde will apply the modified retrospective method. 
linde will apply ifrs 16 for the first time as at 1 january 2019 and the adoption of this standard is expected to result in a right to 
use asset and financial lease obligation of approximately $1 billion.  
the company’s activities as a lessor are not material and hence the company does not expect any significant impact on the 
financial statements beyond some additional disclosure requirements. 
ifric 23
ifric 23 clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements of ias 12 when there is uncertainty over income 
tax treatments. when it is probable (more likely than not) that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, taxable profit 
and loss is determined consistent with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in the income tax filings.
when it is not probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the amount of uncertainty to be recognized 
is calculated using either the expected value or the most likely amount, whichever method better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. 
detection risk is not considered in the analysis. uncertain tax treatments may be considered separately or together based on the approach 
that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. linde will apply ifric 23 for the first time as at 1 january 2019. the company does 
not expect any significant impact as a result of this interpretation.
the remaining standards are not expected to have a  significant impact on the net assets, financial position and results of operations 
of linde.

[7] revenue
contracts with customers
approximately 75% of linde’s consolidated sales are generated from industrial gases and related products in four geographic 
segments (north america, europe, south america and asia), linde ag represents approximately 20% of 2018 sales and the 
remaining 5% is related to the global surface technologies segment.  linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, 
petroleum refining, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment.   
industrial gases
within each of the company’s geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or 
tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. the distribution method used by linde to supply a customer 
is determined by many factors, including the customer’s volume requirements and location.   the distribution method generally 
determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices.   linde’s primary 
products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, 
helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene).  these products are generally sold through one of the three distribution 
methods.
following is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition 
policies:   
on-site. customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by 
cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers’ sites and supplies the product 
directly to customers by pipeline. where there are large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several 
plants and customers.  on-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 
10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. many of the cryogenic on-site plants also 
produce liquid products for the merchant market. therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer.  additionally, 
linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and customers typically have no 
involvement in these activities.  advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume 
requirements. 
the company’s performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain 
control of the product.  linde has elected to apply the practical expedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a 
performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds 
with product delivery.  accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to 
invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.  consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which 
fluctuates with various price indices.  variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered 
constrained.
merchant. merchant deliveries generally are made from linde’s plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's 
site.  due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius 
from the plants at which they are produced.  merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. the 
customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three-to seven-year supply agreements based on the requirements of 
the customer.  these contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.
the company’s performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers 
receive and obtain control of the product.  revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the 
right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.  any variable components of consideration within merchant 
contracts are constrained however this consideration is not significant.
packaged gases. customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high 
pressure. linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are 
then filled for distribution to customers.  cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s site or picked up by the customer at a 
packaging facility or retail store. linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s).  the 
company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers.  packaged gases are generally sold 
under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume 
commitments.
the company’s performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time.  accordingly, revenue is 
recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail 
store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms.  any variable consideration 
is constrained and will be recognized when the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved.  
71
surface technologies
the company’s surface technologies segment, operated through praxair surface technologies, inc., supplies wear-resistant and 
high-temperature corrosion-resistant metallic and ceramic coatings and powders. praxair surface technologies is a leading global 
supplier of coatings services and thermal spray consumables to customers in the aircraft, energy, printing, primary metals, 
petrochemical, textile, and other industries. its coatings are used to provide wear resistance, corrosion protection, thermal insulation, 
and many other surface-enhancing functions which serve to extend component life, enable optimal performance, and reduce operating 
costs. it also manufactures a complete line of electric arc, plasma and wire spray, and high-velocity oxy-fuel ("hvof") equipment.
the company’s performance obligation related to surface technologies customers are generally satisfied at a point in time when 
the customer receives and takes control of product.  accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or 
when the customer picks up the product from the company’s facility, and the company has the right to invoice the customer in 
accordance with the contract terms.
linde engineering
the company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured 
specifically for end customers. sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation.  revenue from 
sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date 
and performance does not create an asset with alternative use.  for contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily 
using a cost incurred input method.  costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress 
toward satisfying performance obligations. costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing 
and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer.  contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing 
contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change.
contract assets and liabilities
contract assets and liabilities result from differences in timing of revenue recognition and customer invoicing.  contract assets 
primarily relate to sale of equipment contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. the balance represents unbilled revenue 
which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure of progress exceeds amounts invoiced to customers. customer invoices 
may be based on the passage of time, the achievement of certain contractual milestones or a combination of both criteria. 
contract liabilities include advance payments or right to consideration prior to performance under the contract. contract 
liabilities are recognized as revenue as performance obligations are satisfied under contract terms. 
linde had contract assets of $267 million as of 31 december 2018, contract assets as 31 december 2017 and 1 january 2017 
were not material. contract liabilities were $1,863 million as of 31 december 2018 contract liabilities as 31 december 2017 and 1 
january 2017 were not material.  contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the linde engineering business acquired in the 
merger.  the industrial gases businesses and surface technologies do not have material contract assets or liabilities.
payment terms and other
linde generally receives payment after performance obligations are satisfied, and customer prepayments are not typical for the 
industrial gases businesses and surface technologies.  payment terms vary based on the country where sales originate and local 
customary payment practices.  linde does not offer extended financing outside of customary payment terms.  amounts billed for sales 
and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue producing transactions 
are presented on a net basis and are not included in sales within the consolidated statement of income.  additionally, sales returns and 
allowances are not a normal practice in the industry and are not significant.  there is no significant concentration of sales with any 
single customer.
disaggregated revenue information
the company manages its industrial gases business on a geographic basis, while the surface technologies business is managed on 
a global basis.  linde ag had been managed as a separate segment due to the restrictions under the hold separate order, which were 
lifted on 1 march 2019.  further, the company believes that reporting sales by distribution method by reportable geographic segment 
best illustrates the nature, timing, type of customer, and contract terms for its revenues, including terms and pricing.  
the following table shows sales by distribution method for each reportable segment and at the consolidated level for the years 
ended 31 december 2018 and 2017.

remaining performance obligations
as described above, linde’s contracts with on-site customers are under long-term supply arrangements which generally require 
the customer to purchase their requirements from linde and also have minimum purchase requirements. the company estimates the 
consideration related to minimum purchase requirements is approximately $48 billion. this amount excludes all sales above minimum 
purchase requirements, which can be significant depending on customer needs. in the future, actual amounts will be different due to 
impacts from several factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to, timing of newly signed, 
terminated and renewed contracts, inflationary price escalations, currency exchange rates, and pass-through costs related to natural gas 
and electricity. the actual duration of long-term supply contracts ranges up to twenty years. the company estimates that 
approximately half of the revenue related to minimum purchase requirements are estimated to be earned in the next five years and the 
remaining thereafter.

foreign (a) 4,560 1,317
total income before income taxes $ 5,516 $ 2,288
(a) includes a $3.778 billion gain related to europe divestiture (see notes 3).
u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (tax act)
on 22 december 2017 the u.s. government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act"). this comprehensive tax legislation 
significantly revised the u.s. corporate income tax rules by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 
21%, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. given the 
substantial uncertainties surrounding the tax act and the short period of time between 22 december 2017 and 31 december 2017 to 
calculate the u.s. federal, u.s. state, and non-u.s. tax impacts of the tax act, at 31 december 2017 the company estimated its 
income tax provision to reflect changes in the tax act.  the company’s 2017 estimated net income tax charge of $394 million has 
three main components: (i) an estimated $467 million u.s. federal and state tax charge for deemed repatriation of accumulated 
foreign earnings recorded in continuing operations; (ii) an estimated $260 million charge for foreign withholding taxes related to 
anticipated future repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in continuing operations; and (iii) an estimated $333 million net deferred 
tax benefit ($427 million benefit recorded in continuing operations and $94 million charge recorded in accumulated other 
comprehensive income) for the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the new 21% tax rate.  the $467 million u.s. 
federal and state tax charge for deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings includes $422 million of deemed repatriation tax 
payable over eight years, of which $388 million is classified as of 31 december 2017 as non-current income tax liabilities on the 
consolidated statement of financial position (see note 22).
during 2018, the company continued to evaluate the tax act, additional guidance from the internal revenue service, its 
historical foreign earnings and taxes and other items that could impact its net provisional tax charge.  additionally, the company 
continued to review its foreign capital structures, organizational cash needs and the foreign withholding tax cost of planned 
repatriation.  in the fourth quarter of 2018, the company completed its accounting and updated its provisional estimates resulting in a 
net reduction to tax expense of $61 million, $41 million u.s. federal and $20 million of state income tax (net of federal tax benefit).  
this resulted in a deemed repatriation tax payable of $291 million payable over the remaining seven years, of which $265 million is 
classified as of 31 december 2018 as non-current income tax liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position (see note 
22).
 further, the tax act enacted new provisions related to the taxation of foreign earnings, known as gilti. the company accounts 
for gilti as period costs when incurred.

effective tax rate reconciliation
for purposes of the effective tax rate reconciliation, the company utilized the u.s. statutory income tax rate of 21% in 2018 and 
35% in 2017, respectively.   an analysis of the difference between the provision for income taxes and the amount computed by 
applying the u.s. statutory income tax rate to pre-tax income follows:

in the countries where the company operates. other permanent items and tax rate changes were not significant.
(c)  divestitures primarily relate to the sale of the praxair's european businesses (see note 3).
(d)  other - net includes $34 million of u.s tax related to gilti and a decrease in tax benefits in europe of $44 million in 2018.

net deferred tax liability, 31 december $ 7,209 $ 881 $ 996
in 2018, the net deferred income tax benefit of $215 million comprised primarily of deferred income tax benefit related to 
inventory of $100 million.  the $6,612 million addition due to the merger of linde ag increased deferred income tax liabilities 
primarily related to fixed assets of $2.9 billion, other intangible assets of $3.9 billion, subsidiary/equity investments of $418 million 
offset by increase in carryforwards of $217 million and benefit plans of $300 million.  the $118 million reduction in net deferred 
income tax liability due to the praxair’s european divestiture in 2018 reduced deferred income taxes primarily related to fixed assets 
of $102 million and goodwill of $36 million.    
in 2017, the net deferred income tax benefit of $104 million comprised primarily of deferred tax expense related to foreign 
withholding tax of $200 million, research and development costs of $113 million offset by deferred tax benefit related to fixed assets 
of $404 million, and goodwill and intangibles of $69 million.  the tax act contributed $427 million of deferred tax benefit due to the 
reduction in the u.s. tax rate from 35% to 21% - see tax act section.  in 2016, the net deferred income tax benefit of $13 million 
comprised primarily of deferred tax expense related to fixed assets of $30 million and goodwill of $15 million offset by deferred tax 
benefits related to research and development costs of $17 million, exchange losses of $23 million.
the company evaluates deferred tax assets quarterly to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character 
(e.g., capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. after considering the positive and 
negative evidence, the company reduces the assets to their realizable value when management determines that it is probable (i.e., 
greater than 50% likelihood) that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. considerable judgment is required in valuing deferred tax 
assets.
the company had $346 million, $143 million and $154 million of deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses (“nols”) 
and tax credits as of 31 december 2018 and 2017, and 1 january 2017, respectively.  these deferred tax assets include $292 million,
$132 million and $141 million relating to nols and $54 million, $11 million and $13 million related to tax credits as of 31 december 
2018 and 2017, and 1 january 2017, respectively.  of the nol’s, $20 million ($0 million at both 31 december 2017 and 1 january 
2017) expire within 5 years, $84 million (31 december 2017 - $45 million, 1 january 2017 $70 million) expire after 5 years and $188 
million (31 december 2017 - $87 million, 1 january 2017 - $71 million) have no expiration. of the credits, $1 million (($0 million at 
both 31 december 2017 and 1 january 2017)  expire within 5 years, $20 million (31 december 2017  - $11 million, 1 january 2017 - 
$13 million), expire after 5 years and $33 million  ($0 million at both 31 december 2017 and 1 january 2017) have no expiration.
 deferred tax assets of $210 million (31 december 2017 - $54 million, 1 january 2017 - $56million) have not been recognized 
relating to nol’s of $853 million  (31 december 2017 - $200 million, 1 january 2017 - $194 million), tax credits of $58 million (31 
december 2017  - $22 million, 1 january 2017 - $84 million) and deductible temporary differences of $42 million (31 december 2017 
- $10 million, 2016 - $2 million), respectively.  the tax benefits related to nol’s, tax credits and deductible temporary differences 
were not recognized as it is probable (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood) that the nol’s and deferred tax assets will not be realized.
of the loss carryforwards and tax credits not recognized totaling $911 million (31 december 2017  - $222 million, 1 january 
2017 - $277 million), $134 million (31 december 2017  - $50 million, 1 january 2017 - $58 million) expire within 5 years, $61

the company also has u.s. state nol carryforwards of $1,037 million, $404 million, and $642 million as of 31 december 2018 
and 2017, and 1 january 2017, respectively.
the company has $570 million of foreign income taxes accrued related to its investments in subsidiaries and equity investments 
as of 31 december 2018 (2017 - $260 million, $0 at 1 january 2017).   a provision has not been made for any additional foreign 
income tax at 31 december 2018 on approximately $30 billion related to its investments in subsidiaries because the company controls 
the subsidiaries and intends to remain indefinitely reinvested.  while the $30 billion could become subject to additional foreign 
income tax if there is a sale of a subsidiary or if earnings are remitted as dividends, it is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized 
deferred tax liability.
distributions to linde plc shareholders do not have any impact on taxes on income at the level of linde plc.

the linde name acquired in the course of the merger of $1,669 million has an indefinite useful life. the indefinite lived asset at 
linde ag acquired as part of the business combination has been assessed for impairment, and there is no indication that the recoverable  
amount is below the carrying amount.

the amortization expense for intangible assets with finite useful lives was disclosed in functional costs, principally in marketing 
and selling expenses.
software solutions are the main component of other intangible assets.

the company performs annual impairment testing each year. impairment testing is performed by business unit, which is a group 
of cash-generating units ("cgus"), as this is the level at which management monitors goodwill. 
the recoverable amount of each unit is determined using the unit’s fair value less costs to sell. in order to determine the fair value 
of the unit, the company utilizes a market multiples approach, multiplying the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization 
("ebitda") of each unit by an ebitda multiple.
the ebitda multiple used to determine fair value was calculated by an external financial information as of the date at which the 
impairment test is performed, based on the enterprise value of comparable companies divided by the ebitda of these companies. the 
share prices of comparable companies, used to calculate the enterprise value, are derived from publicly available information. inputs 
such as adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization of comparable companies, are developed by the external 
provider using financial data published by these companies. the data used to calculate the multiple is assigned to level 2 of the fair value 
hierarchy. 
the company has not recorded any goodwill impairment losses. as of 1 january 2017, 31 december 2017, and 31 december 2018 
the recoverable amounts of each unit significantly exceeded their net carrying amount. 
the market multiples used as of 31 december 2018 were within the range of 10.2 to 13.8. at 31 december 2017 the market multiple 
was 9.1 (1 january 2017 was 12.1), and the valuation technique was consistently applied for each period. no reasonably possible change 
in key assumptions would result in an impairment.  a significant decline in ebitda across any group of cgus could result in a future 
impairment charge. ebitda would have to decline by 25%  before there would be risk of a goodwill impairment charge.

tangible leased assets include buildings, machinery and equipment, and fixtures, with a carrying amount totaling $71 million (2017: 
$3 million). due to the form of the underlying finance leases, these tangible assets are attributable to linde in its capacity as the economic 
82
owner of the assets. of the total $24 million (none in 2017) relates to land and buildings, $0 million (2017: $2 million) to machinery and 
equipment and $47 million (2017: $1 million) to vehicles.
impairment tests were based on the recoverable amount of the assets examined, whereby generally the value in use was applied.  
impairment losses of $51 million were recognized in 2018 (no impairments in 2017) within currency and other adjustments. the impairment 
losses related mainly to production plants and were allocated to the following segments: asia $22 million and north america $29 million. 
the impairment losses relating to tangible assets are largely included in cost of sales.
borrowing costs during the construction phase of $20 million (2017: $28 million) were capitalized, based on an approximately 2.8%
interest rate for both 2018 and 2017.
tangible assets of $53 million were pledged as security.

[17] equity
equity presentation
called-up share capital presented as equity ("called-up share capital") represents the notional value of outstanding ordinary shares.
   share premium represents the accumulated premiums arising on the issue of shares.  
    retained earnings (including remeasurement of defined benefit plans)  represents the portion of net income retained by the company 
that have not been declared or distributed to shareholders as dividends.
     treasury shares represents the premium over par value of linde plc share that have been repurchased by the company and not yet 
cancelled or retired.
     other reserves reports the differences arising from currency translation differences of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries 
and gains or losses on the remeasurement of securities and hedging instruments, accounted for in equity rather than being recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss. 
initial adoption of ifrs
effective 1 january 2017, the company applied the provisions of ifrs 1, first-time adoption of international financial reporting 
standards.  the initial adoption of ifrs resulted in certain adjustments to the equity of linde plc as of 1 january 2017.  see note 29 for 
a detailed analysis of these adjustments.
linde plc shareholders’ equity
at 31 december 2018, linde has total authorized share capital of €1,825,000 divided into 1,750,000,000 ordinary shares of €0.001
each, 25,000 a ordinary shares of €1.00 each, 25,000 deferred shares of €1.00 each and 25,000,000 preferred shares of €0.001 each.
     at 31 december 2018 there were 551,310,272 and 547,241,630 of linde plc ordinary shares issued and outstanding, respectively.   at 
31 december 2018 there were no shares of a ordinary shares, deferred shares or preferred shares issued or outstanding.
     at 31 december 2017 there were 800,000,000 shares of praxair common stock authorized (par value $0.01 per share) of which shares 
383,230,625 were issued and 286,776,991 were outstanding at 31 december 2017.  at 31 december 2017, there were 25,000,000 shares 
of praxair preferred stock (par value $0.01 per share) authorized, of which no shares were issued and outstanding. 
      the linde board of directors may from time to time authorize the issuance of one or more series of preferred stock and, in connection 
with the creation of such series, determine the characteristics of each such series including, without limitation, the preference and relative, 
participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the series.
merger of praxair and linde ag
the total fair value of consideration transferred for the merger was $43,288 million, resulting in an increase to stockholders' equity 
(see note 2 for additional information).  on 31 october 2018, the conversion of praxair common stock and linde ag common stock 
into linde ordinary shares resulted in a $3 million decrease to "called-up share capital " in order to reflect the aggregate par value of 
outstanding ordinary shares. each share of praxair common stock held in treasury immediately prior to the merger was canceled.  the 
elimination of praxair's historical treasury shares at cost resulted in a $7,113 million decrease in "treasury shares". the current balance 
reported in treasury shares represent the value of those shares of linde plc acquired subsequent to the merger. 
     as indicated above, in connection with the merger, praxair and linde ag common stock was converted into shares of linde plc 
ordinary shares.

 different countries have different pension systems, due to the variety of legal, economic and fiscal conditions applicable in each 
country. these are generally based on the remuneration and length of service of the employees.
      the provisions for similar obligations include bridging allowances as well as other obligations. occupational pension schemes can 
be either defined contribution or defined benefit schemes. in the case of defined benefit plans, the company’s obligation is to meet the 
defined benefit commitments to current and former employees. two different methods can be distinguished: the recognition of provisions 
for pensions and the use of externally financed pension schemes. 
defined contribution plans
linde’s u.s. business employees are eligible to participate in the linde defined contribution savings plan. employees may contribute 
up to 40 percent of their compensation, subject to the maximum allowable by irs regulations. for the u.s. packaged gases business, 
company contributions to this plan are calculated as a percentage of salary based on age plus service.  u.s. employees other than those 
in the packaged gases business have company contributions to this plan calculated on a graduated scale based on employee contributions 
to the plan. the cost for these defined contribution plans was $33 million in 2018 and $29 million in 2017 (these costs are not included 
in the tables that follow).
     the defined contribution plans include a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan ("esop") which covers all employees 
participating in this plan. the collective number of shares of linde ordinary shares in the esop totaled 2,381,714 at 31 december 
2018.
     certain non-u.s. subsidiaries of the company also sponsor defined contribution plans where contributions are determined under 
various formulas. the expense for these plans was $32 million in 2018 and $21 million in 2017 (these expenses are not included in the 
tables that follow).  
defined benefit pension plans
linde has two main u.s. retirement programs which are non-contributory defined benefit plans: the linde pension plan and the cbi 
pension plan. the latter program benefits primarily former employees of cbi industries, inc. which linde acquired in 1996. effective 
1 july 2002, the linde pension plan was amended to give participating employees a one-time choice to remain covered by the old formula 
or to elect coverage under a new formula. the old formula is based predominantly on years of service, age and compensation levels prior 
to retirement, while the new formula provides for an annual contribution to an individual account which grows with interest each year 
at a predetermined rate. also, this new formula applies to all new employees hired after 30 april 2002 into businesses adopting this plan. 
the plan participants have the option to take a lump-sum payment or annual pension payments. legal and regulatory minimum funding 
requirements are in place.  
in addition to the u.s. retirement plans linde has other global defined benefit commitments, primarily in germany and the united 
kingdom ("uk"). the defined benefit commitments in germany relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents 
pensions. these commitments also take into account vested rights for periods of service prior to 1 january 2002 based on earlier final 
salary pension plan rules.  in addition, there are direct commitments in respect of the salary conversion scheme for the form of cash 
balance plans. the resulting pension payments are calculated on the basis of an interest guarantee and the performance of the corresponding 
investment. there are no minimum funding requirements. the pension obligations in germany are partly funded by a contractual trust 
agreement ("cta"). defined benefit commitments in the u.k. prior to 1 july 2003 are earnings-related and dependent on the period of 
service. such commitments relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. beginning in 1 april 2011, 
the amount of future increases in inflation-linked pensions and of increases in pensionable emoluments was restricted. legal, regulatory 
and contractual minimum funding requirements are in place. regulatory funding obligations to resolve a deficit, based on the local 
valuation, mainly relate to the uk. a renegotiated multi-year funding plan has been signed in 2018. the annual payments are £35 million 
per year payable in december as long as there is a deficit under local valuation.
the u.s. and non-u.s. pension plan assets are comprised of a diversified mix of investments, including domestic and international 
corporate equities, government securities and corporate debt securities. linde has several plans that provide supplementary retirement 
benefits primarily to higher level employees that are unfunded and are nonqualified for federal tax purposes. pension coverage for 
employees of certain of linde’s non-u.s. subsidiaries generally is provided by those companies through separate plans. obligations under 
such plans are primarily provided for through diversified investment portfolios, with some smaller plans provided for under insurance 
policies or by book reserves.

multi-employer pension plans
in the united states linde participates in six multi-employer defined benefit pension plans ("meps"), pursuant to the terms of collective 
bargaining agreements, covering approximately 200 union-represented employees. the collective bargaining agreements expire on 
different dates through 2021. in connection with such agreements, the company is required to make periodic contributions to the meps 
in accordance with the terms of the respective collective bargaining agreements. linde’s participation in these plans is not material either 
at the plan level or in the aggregate. linde’s contributions to these plans were $2 million in 2018 and 2017 (these costs are not included 
in the tables that follow). for all meps, linde’s contributions were significantly less than 1 percent of the total contributions to each plan 
for 2017. total 2018 contributions were not yet available from the meps.
      linde has obtained the most recently available pension protection act ("ppa") annual funding notices from the trustees of the meps. 
the ppa classifies meps as either red, yellow or green zone plans. among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 
65 percent funded with a projected insolvency date within the next twenty years; plans in the yellow zone are generally 65 to 80 percent 
funded; and plans in the green zone are generally at least 80 percent funded. according to the most current data available, three of the 
meps that the company participates in are in a red zone status and three are in a green zone status. as of 31 december 2018, the three 
red zone plans have pending or have implemented financial improvement or rehabilitation plans. linde does not currently anticipate 
significant future obligations due to the funding status of these plans. if linde determined it was probable that it would withdraw from 
an mep, the company would record a liability for its portion of the mep’s unfunded pension obligations, as calculated at that time. 
historically, such withdrawal payments have not been significant.
     the amount of the pension obligation (actuarial present value of the defined benefit obligation, or dbo) was calculated using actuarial 
valuation methods, which require the use of estimates. in addition to assumptions about mortality and disability, the following assumptions, 
which depend on the economic situation in that particular country, are also relevant; for countries classed as "all other", weighted average 
figures based on the obligation are given:

the growth in future benefits comprises expected future increases in salaries, which are estimated annually, taking inflation and the 
economic situation into account.
    the sensitivity analysis below demonstrates the extent to which the present value of the defined benefit obligation changes when, in 
each case, just one of the actuarial assumptions changes while the other actuarial assumptions remain the same.
 
      for the pension plans in germany, an increase of one year in life expectancy would result in an increase in the defined benefit obligation 
of 4.9 percent. the sensitivity analysis of life expectancy in germany is based on pension funds held at 31 december 2018. for the 
pension plans in the uk, an increase of one year in life expectancy would result in an increase in the dbo of 3.9 percent (2017: 3.4 
percent). for the pension plans in the united states, no sensitivity analysis of life expectancy was prepared, as the plan participants 
generally avail themselves of the option to be paid a lump sum.
     in germany, life expectancy is calculated on the basis of the “2018 g mortality tables” produced by professor dr klaus heubeck. 
pension plans in the uk use their own mortality tables and biometric assumptions. these are determined on the basis of actual experience 
in a pool of comparable pension plans. at the reporting date, the average life expectancy applicable to pension plans in the uk is 22.7 
years for a male pensioner aged 65 (2017: 22.4 years) and 24.5 years for a female pensioner aged 65 (2017: 24.4 years), while the future 
average life expectancy at the pensionable age of 65 for active members of the pension plans is currently 25.0 years for men aged 45 
(2017: 23.6 years) and 27.3 years for women aged 45 (2017: 25.7 years).

benefit obligations were remeasured as of the merger date and all subsequent activity through 31 december 2018 is presented within the 
respective caption above.
contributions
at a minimum, linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., erisa in the united states). 
discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections 
of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of the 
cash. changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. pension contributions were $87 
million in 2018, $19 million in 2017 and $11 million in 2016. estimated required contributions for 2019 are currently expected to be in 
the range of $95 million to $160 million. 
 the expense for newly acquired pension entitlements in the financial year and the net interest cost for each respective financial year 
are determined each year on the basis of the prior year’s net obligation at the reporting date.

for the external financing of defined benefit obligations, the company uses standard international models for the transfer of pension 
assets (e.g. pension funds and contractual trust arrangements). pension plans financed via external pension funds exist principally in 
australia, canada, germany, ireland, south africa, switzerland, the uk and the u.s.
     in some countries, linde is obliged to make contributions to plan assets as a result of legal requirements or contractual agreements. 
in certain countries, however, these increases in plan assets will not lead to the recognition of an asset because of the asset ceiling described 
in ias 19.64 (ifric 14). in 2018, as in the previous year, there was no asset ceiling.

linde is exposed to various risks in relation to defined benefit pension schemes. in addition to general actuarial risks, the company 
is exposed to currency risk and investment risk in respect of the plan assets. 
     plan assets and the defined benefit obligation may fluctuate over time. to compensate for such fluctuations, potential fluctuations in 
the defined benefit obligation are taken into account in the course of the investment management of the plan assets. in ideal circumstances, 
plan assets and pension obligations are influenced in the same way by external factors, which provides a natural protection against such 
factors (liability-driven investment). moreover, the broadly-based portfolio structure of plan assets in the company results in diversification 
of capital market risk.

plan assets comprise mainly shares and fixed-interest securities. prices quoted in an active market are not available in the case of 
property and insurance. around half of the fixed-interest securities relate to government bonds issued by first-rate debtors (the uk, the 
u.s. and germany) as part of the “liability-driven investment” strategies pursued by the corresponding pension plans, while the rest relate 
to broadly diversified portfolios of bonds issued by companies and emerging markets, as well as loans to finance companies and property.
     financial instruments issued by the company are not included in plan assets to any significant extent. the plan assets do not include

the provisions for warranties relate mainly to the engineering division and are generally utilized within three years.
    the provisions for obligations relating to personnel comprise mainly provisions for profit-sharing and other variable compensation.
      the provisions for dismantling obligations are stated at a discounted settlement amount. a corresponding item is recognised in tangible 
assets and is subject to depreciation. the provision is compounded over the duration of the underlying contracts. due to the wide range 
of residual terms of the contracts, the residual term of the provision falls mainly in a range of between one and twenty years. 
     the restructuring provisions include provisions for the cost reduction and efficiency programs.

credit facilities
at 31 december 2018, the company has the following major credit facilities available for future borrowing:
total borrowings available for
(millions of dollars) facility outstanding borrowing expires
praxair senior unsecured $ 2,500 $ — $ 2,500 january 2019
linde ag revolving credit facility € 2,500 $ — € 2,500 july 2020
in june 2017, praxair entered into a $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which expired in june 2018 
and was not renewed. 
     the $2.5 billion and €2.5 billion credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable by the issuing financial 
institutions until their respective maturities. there are no financial covenants contained in the agreement relating to the linde ag €2.5 
billion credit facility; the only financial covenant for the senior unsecured $2.5 billion credit facility requires the company not to exceed 
a maximum 70% leverage ratio. no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreements as of 31 december 2018.
     on 26 march 2019 the company entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement ("the credit agreement") with a syndicate of 
banking institutions. the credit agreement became effective on 29 march 2019. the credit agreement provides for total commitments 
of $5 billion, which may be increased to up to $6.5 billion subject to receipt of additional commitments and satisfaction of customary 
conditions. in connection with the effectiveness of the credit agreement, each of praxair and linde ag terminated their respective 
existing revolving credit agreements disclosed in the table above.
covenants 
linde’s $2.5 billion senior unsecured credit facility and long-term debt agreements contain various covenants which may, among other 
things, restrict certain types of mergers and changes in beneficial ownership of the company, and the ability of the company to incur or 
guarantee debt, sell or transfer certain assets, create liens against assets, enter into sale and leaseback agreements, or pay dividends and 
make other distributions beyond certain limits. these agreements also require linde to not exceed a maximum 70 percent leverage ratio 
defined in the agreements as the ratio of consolidated total debt to the sum of consolidated total debt plus consolidated shareholders’ 
equity of the company. for purposes of the leverage ratio calculation, consolidated shareholders’ equity excludes changes in the cumulative 
foreign currency translation adjustments after 30 june 2011. at 31 december 2018, the actual leverage ratio, as calculated according to 
the agreement, was 34 percent and the company is in compliance with all financial covenants. also, there are no material adverse change 
clauses or other subjective conditions that would restrict the company’s ability to borrow under the agreement.
96
other debt information
as of 31 december 2018 and 2017, the weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings outstanding was 0.6 percent and 2.1 
percent, respectively. the decrease in the rate year-over-year is related primarily to significant european commercial paper balances at 
negative interest rates, which offsets the impact of higher rates on other bank borrowings. 
     in february 2016, linde redeemed $325 million of 5.20% notes due march 2017 resulting in a $16 million interest charge ($10 million 
after-tax, or $0.04 per diluted share).

[23] share option schemes
  share-based compensation expense was $62 million in 2018 ($59 million in 2017). the related income tax benefit recognized 
was $8 million in 2018 ($18 million in 2017). the expense was primarily recorded in marketing & selling and administration expenses 
and no share-based compensation expense was capitalized.
summary of plans 
  the 2009 praxair, inc. long-term incentive plan was initially adopted by the board of directors and shareholders of praxair, 
inc. on 28 april 2009 and has been amended since its initial adoption ("the 2009 plan"). upon completion of the business combination 
of praxair, inc. with linde ag on 31 october 2018, the 2009 plan was assumed by the company. prior to 28 april 2009, praxair, inc. 
granted equity awards under the 2002 praxair, inc. long-term incentive plan, (“the 2002 plan”) which was also assumed by the 
company upon completion of the business combination. the 2009 plan permits awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, 
restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance-based stock units and other equity awards to eligible officer and non-officer 
employees and non-employee directors of the company and its affiliates. as of 31 december 2018, 8,009,603 shares remained 
available for equity grants under the 2009 plan, of which 2,600,000 shares may be granted as awards other than options or stock 
appreciation rights.
      in 2005, the board of directors and shareholders of praxair, inc. adopted the 2005 equity compensation plan for non-
employee directors of praxair, inc. ("the 2005 plan"). upon completion of the business combination in october 2018, the 2005 plan 
was also assumed by the company. under the 2005 plan, the aggregate number of shares available for option and other equity grants 
was limited to a total of 500,000 shares. the 2005 plan expired on 30 april 2010, by its own terms, and no shares were available for 
grant thereafter.
   upon the completion of the business combination, all options outstanding under the 2009 plan, the 2002 plan and the 2005 
plan were converted into options to acquire the same number of shares of the company and at the same exercise price per share that 
applied prior to the business combination.
  exercise prices for options granted under the 2009 plan may not be less than the closing market price of the company’s 
common stock on the date of grant and granted options may not be re-priced or exchanged without shareholder approval. options 
granted under the 2009 plan subject only to time vesting requirements may become partially exercisable after a minimum of one year 
after the date of grant but may not become fully exercisable until at least three years have elapsed from the date of grant, and all 
options have a maximum duration of ten years. options granted under predecessor plans had similar terms.
 
  in connection with the business combination, on 31 october 2018 the company's board of directors adopted the long term 
incentive plan of linde plc (“the ltip 2018”), the purpose of which is to replace certain outstanding linde ag equity based awards 
that were terminated in connection with the exchange offer. under the ltip 2018, the aggregate number of shares available for 
replacement option rights and replacement restricted share units was set at 473,128.  as of 31 december 2018, all shares remained 
available for grant, as the company is not obligated to make these replacement awards until 2019.
     
  exercise prices for the replacement option rights to be granted in 2019 under the ltip 2018 will be equal to €1.67 as 
prescribed in the business combination agreement.  each replacement option right granted under the ltip 2018 will be subject to 
vesting based on continued service until the end of the four-year waiting period applicable to the relevant linde ag award that had 
been granted before the business combination. after vesting, each option right will be exercisable for one year.
     
  in order to satisfy option exercises and other equity grants, the company may issue authorized but previously unissued shares 
or it may issue treasury shares. 
stock option fair value
  the company utilizes the black-scholes options-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options consistent with 
that used in prior years. management is required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs, including 
anticipated changes in the underlying stock price (i.e., expected volatility) and option exercise activity (i.e., expected life). expected 
volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated 
expected life of the company’s stock options and other factors. the expected life of options granted, which represents the period of 
time that the options are expected to be outstanding, is based primarily on historical exercise experience. the expected dividend yield 
98
is based on the company’s most recent history and expectation of dividend payouts. the risk-free rate is based on the u.s. treasury 
yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life. if factors change and result in 
different assumptions in future periods, the stock option expense that the company records for future grants may differ significantly 
from what the company has recorded in the current period.
    
   the weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2018 was $19.29 ($12.40 in 2017) based on the black-scholes 
options-pricing model. the increase in grant date fair value year-over-year is primarily attributable to an increase in the company's 
stock price.
  the following weighted-average assumptions were used to value the grants in 2018 and 2017: 
year ended 31 december 2018 2017
dividend yield 2.1% 2.7%
volatility 14.4% 14.0%
risk-free interest rate 2.67% 2.13%
expected term years 5 6
the following table summarizes option activity under the plans as of 31 december 2018  and 2017 and changes during the 
periods then ended (averages are calculated on a weighted basis; life in years; intrinsic value expressed in millions): 
number  of average average aggregate

outstanding at 31 december 2018 10,624 $ 117.65 5.9 $ 408
exercisable at 31 december 2018 7,065 $ 111.16 4.7 $ 317
the aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the company’s closing stock price of $156.04 as of 31 december 
2018 and the exercise price multiplied by the number of in the money options outstanding as of that date. the total intrinsic value of 
stock options exercised during 2018 was $113 million ($137 million in 2017.)
cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2018 was $66 million ($107 million in 
2017). the cash tax benefit realized from share-based compensation totaled $30 million for 2018 ($51 million in 2017). 
as of 31 december 2018, $19 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be 
recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1 year.
performance-based and restricted stock awards
no performance-based stock awards were granted in 2018 as restricted stock units were granted in place of performance-based 
stock awards. in years prior to 2018, the company granted performance-based stock awards under the 2009 plan to senior management 
that vest, subject to the attainment of pre-established minimum performance criteria, principally on the third anniversary of their date 
of grant. these awards were tied to either return on capital ("roc") performance or relative total shareholder return ("tsr") 
performance versus that of the s&p 500.  the actual number of shares issued in settlement of a vested award can range from zero to 
200 percent of the target number of shares granted based upon the company’s attainment of specified performance targets at the end of 
a three-year period. compensation expense related to these awards is recognized over the three-year performance period based on the 
fair value of the closing market price of the company’s common stock on the date of the grant and the estimated performance that will 
be achieved. compensation expense for roc awards were adjusted during the three-year performance period based upon the 
estimated performance levels that will be achieved. tsr awards were measured at their grant date fair value and not subsequently re-
measured. 
99
upon completion of the merger, each outstanding roc and tsr performance-based award was converted into a linde plc rsu 
based on performance achieved as of immediately prior to the closing of the merger, and became subject to service-vesting conditions 
only.   this resulted in the conversion of 435,000 performance-based shares into 704,000 restricted stock units.  compensation 
expense related to these awards will continue to be recognized over the remainder of the respective three-year service period. 
there were 278,907 restricted stock units granted to employees by praxair during 2018. in addition, praxair had previously 
granted restricted stock to certain key employees that vest after a designated service period ranging from 2 to 10 years although the 
majority of the restricted stock units vest at the end of a three-year service period. generally, restricted stock does not earn quarterly 
dividends while vesting. compensation expense related to the restricted stock units is recognized over the vesting period. these 
awards were converted into equivalent linde plc restricted stock units at the time of the business combination.
the weighted-average fair value of  roc performance-based stock awards granting during 2017 $109.68. the weighted-average 
fair value of restricted stock units granted during 2018 was $144.86 ($111.95 in 2017). these fair values are based on the closing 
market price of linde's common stock on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period.
the weighted-average fair value of performance-based stock tied to relative tsr performance granted during 2017 was 
$124.12, and was estimated using a monte carlo simulation performed as of the grant date. 
the following table summarizes non-vested performance-based and restricted stock award activity as of 31 december 2018 and 
2017, and changes during the periods then ended (shares based on target amounts, averages are calculated on a weighted basis):

there are approximately 12 thousand restricted stock shares that are non-vested at 31 december 2018 which will be settled in 
cash due to foreign regulatory limitations. the liability related to these grants reflects the current estimate of performance that will be 
achieved and the current common stock price. 
as of 31 december 2018, $30 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the restricted stock awards is expected to be 
recognized primarily through the first quarter of 2021.

    the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt, accounts receivables-net, and accounts payable approximate carrying 
value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.
    the fair value of financial instruments is generally determined using stock exchange prices. if stock exchange prices are not available, 
the fair value is determined using measurement methods customary in the market, based on market parameters specific to the instrument.
the fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined as follows: options are valued using the black-scholes option pricing 
model. futures are measured with recourse to the quoted market price in the relevant market. all other derivative financial instruments 
are measured by discounting expected future cash flows using the net present value method. as far as possible, the entry parameters used 
in these models are relevant observable market prices and interest rates at the reporting date.
101
    the following table shows the financial instruments in linde plc which are measured at fair value. linde plc uses the following hierarchy 
to determine and disclose fair values based on the method used to ascertain their fair values:
•  level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
•  level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
or indirectly.
•  level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

during the reporting year, there were no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
     the fair value of financial instruments in the “financial assets at amortised cost”, and “financial liabilities at amortised cost” categories 
is determined by discounting the expected cash flows. the interest rates applied are the same as those that would apply to new financial 
instruments with a similar risk structure, currency and maturity. fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method, taking 
into account individual credit ratings and other market circumstances in the form of credit and liquidity spreads generally applied in the 
market (level 2). the exception to this is bonds issued by linde ag and linde finance b.v. traded in the capital market (level 1). the 
fair value of these instruments is determined using the current stock exchange price. in cases involving short-term financial instruments 
in the “financial assets at amortised cost”, and “financial liabilities at amortised cost” categories, it is assumed that the fair value corresponds 
to the carrying amount.
      level 3 investments and securities contain a venture fund. for the valuation, linde uses the net asset value received as part of the 
fund's quarterly reporting, which for the most part is not based on quoted prices in active markets. in order to reflect current market 
conditions, linde proportionally adjusts these by observable market data (stock exchange prices) or current transaction prices.in the 
2018 financial year, there were no differences between the fair value of a financial instrument when it was first recognized and the 
amount which would have been recognized at that time had the valuation methods described above been used.
     the following table summarizes the changes in level 3 investments and securities for the years ended 31 december 2018 and 31 
december 2017. gains (losses) recognized in earnings are recorded to in financial income (expense) within the company's

the net financial gains and losses on financial instruments arise from changes in fair value, the recognition and reversal of impairment 
losses, eliminations and exchange rate fluctuations.
   the net financial gains and losses correspond to the valuation gains and losses of the financial instruments but exclude interest and 
dividends.
     free-standing derivatives comprise all those derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments. they include those derivatives 
in economic hedging relationships not designated as hedges in respect of which gains and losses arising from the underlying transaction 
and the hedged item are recognised at the same time in the statement of profit and loss.
   the financial result includes fees and other costs of capital of $6 million (2017: $3 million) relating to financial instruments not at fair 
value through profit and loss.
   no interest income has been accrued which relates to impaired financial instruments, especially receivables.

for cash and cash equivalents and other receivables, linde determines the 12-month expected credit loss as a basis for impairment 
losses. in the reporting period these impairment losses were not significant.
    financial assets which are initially measured at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (eir) method 
and are subject to impairment. linde’s financial assets at amortized cost includes trade receivables, receivables from finance lease, 
loan receivables and other financial assets included under other assets. trade receivables are measured at the transaction price, the face 
value less impairment, if the receivables do not contain a significant financing component. management has considered factors such as 
the difference between the cash price for assets and transaction prices within its agreements, terms of its agreements and market 
103
interest rates. management has reviewed its current portfolio noting that its receivables do not contain significant financing 
components.
    for trade receivables, linde applies the simplified approach permitted by ifrs 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be 
recognized from initial recognition of the receivables. the expected loss rates are based on an analysis of the actual historical default 
rates (between 1.5 and 2 years) for each business and product area, taking regional circumstances into account. if necessary, these historical 
default rates are adjusted to reflect the impact of current changes in the macroeconomic environment using forward-looking information. 
the default rates are also critically evaluated based on the expectations of the responsible management team regarding the collectability 
of the receivables. gross receivables aged less than one year were $4,048 million and $1,703 million at 31 december 2018 and 2017 
respectively and gross receivables aged greater than one year were $177 million and $110 million at 31 december 2018 and 2017.  average 
loss rates on receivables aged less than one year were approximately 1.9% and 1.6% at 31 december 2018 and 2017 respectively.   
receivables aged greater than one year are generally fully reserved unless specific circumstances warrant exceptions.  
     trade receivables net of reserves were $4,111 million at 31 december 2018 and $1,675 million at 31 december 2017.  allowances 
for expected credit losses were $113 million at 31 december 2018 and $138 million at 31 december  2017.  provisions for expected 
credit losses were $25 million and $33 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively. the allowance activity in each period related primarily 
to write-offs of uncollectible amounts, net of recoveries and currency movements.

risk positions and risk management
linde plc is exposed to a variety of financial risks. these include in particular: counterparty risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, 
exchange rate risk and other market price risks. these are described below. for further information about risk management at linde, 
please refer to the disclosures in the management report.
counterparty risk
counterparties to linde’s derivatives are major banking institutions with credit ratings of investment grade or better. as of year-
end, linde ag had existing credit support annexes ("csas") in place with their principal counterparties to minimize potential default 
risk and to mitigate counterparty risk. under the csas, the fair values of derivatives for the purpose of interest rate and currency 
management are collateralized with cash on a regular basis. as 31 december, 2018, the impact of such collateral posting arrangements 
on the fair value of derivatives was insignificant. management believes the risk of incurring losses on derivative contracts related to 
credit risk is remote and any resulting losses would be immaterial.

     for the 2016 and 2017 financial years, there were no derivatives with either positive or negative fair values that were subject to 
offsetting or enforceable master agreements. therefore, no information has been presented in the table above for these periods. 
liquidity risk
     liquidity risk is the risk that the company will no longer be able to meet its financial payment obligations. contractual 
undiscounted expected future cash flows from financial liabilities are shown in the table below:

     within this context, it is important to note that the cash outflows from derivative financial liabilities in the amount of $804 million 
(2017: $0 million) are offset by cash inflows from derivatives with gross settlement in the amount of $722 million (2017: $0 million).
interest rate risks
interest rate risks arise from market fluctuations in interest rates. as a result of its financing activities, linde plc is exposed to a 
risk from interest rate changes. at 31 december 2018, linde plc held interest-bearing instruments (net, including interest rate 
derivatives/hedges) totaling $15.3 billion (2017: $9.0 billion). of these, $12.6 billion (2017: $8.2 billion) related to instruments 
bearing interest at fixed interest rates and $2.7 billion (2017: $747 million) to instruments bearing interest at variable rates. this is 
equivalent to a company-wide fixed-rate ratio of 82 percent (2017: 91 percent).
     linde plc has used forward payer swaps to provide an element of hedging against exposure to rising interest rates with regard to 
future bond issues.
     based on instruments bearing interest at variable rates and financial instruments hedging interest rate risks which linde plc holds 
or has issued, a hypothetical change in the interest rates applicable to the respective instruments would have had the following effects 
(if exchange rates remained constant):

exchange rate risks
due to its activities as an international group, linde is exposed to exchange rate risks. its broad spread of activities over many 
different currency areas and its local business model result in a low concentration of risk for the company.
     linde monitors and manages its exchange rate risk, a risk which has an impact on its operations. the gross exchange rate risk 
encompasses all the operating activities of the company. this gross exchange rate risk is reduced by around 85 percent (2017: 94 
percent). therefore, linde is exposed at the reporting date to a net exchange rate risk from operating activities involving foreign 
currency corresponding to 15 percent (2017: 6 percent) of the original unsecured risk.
     the risk of exchange rate movements is monitored for internal management purposes on the basis of a value-at-risk, which relates 
to positions in currencies other than the relevant functional currency.
     the value-at-risk is calculated on the basis of historical data (250 working days) in accordance with international banking 
standards. the value-at-risk presents the maximum potential loss based on a probability of 97.5 percent for a holding period of twelve 
months. the calculation takes into account correlations between the transactions being considered; the risk of a portfolio is generally 
lower than the total of the respective individual risks.
     at 31 december 2018, the value-at-risk was $22 million (2017: $14 million).
other market price risks
as a result of its energy purchases, linde is exposed to risks arising from changes in commodity prices. linde plc monitors and 
manages these commodity price risks arising from the purchase of electricity, natural gas and propane for use in production. these 
hedging operations are governed by risk management guidelines, compliance with which is monitored. commodity price risks are 
hedged in the main by long-term supply contracts or limited by the form and structure of sales contracts. derivatives are also used to a 
much lesser extent to hedge against the exposure to changes in the price of electricity, natural gas and propane gas. the commodity 
price risk from financial instruments is therefore not material.
hedge accounting
cash flow hedges
linde hedges cash flows at both consolidated and company levels, based on agreed minimum hedging rates. at the company level, 
future transactions which are highly probable are hedged against foreign exchange risks. 
     in general, these hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with ifrs 9, financial instruments. the effective 
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instruments is recognized directly in equity and released to the statement of profit and loss 
when the hedged cash flows are also recognised in the statement of profit and loss or if a hedged future transaction is no longer 
expected to occur. in addition, the risks associated with changes in interest rates relating to certain financial liabilities or future 
financing measures are hedged by derivative financial instruments and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
106
     linde also hedges the exposure to commodity price risks which arise in the normal course of business from its procurement 
transactions and result in open risk positions. to reduce the extent of the risk, linde enters into a small number of electricity, natural 
gas and propane gas derivatives. usually, hedging relationships of this type are also designated as cash flow hedging relationships, if 
this accords with the facts.
     if the hedged future transactions (forecast transactions as defined by ifrs 9) result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or 
liability, the initial carrying amounts of these are adjusted for the amount recorded in equity. this is usually the case for non-current 
assets and inventories.

fair value hedges
linde uses interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities as a result 
of interest rate changes. if the hedge is deemed to be effective, the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for changes in the fair 
value attributable to the hedged risk.
the following table shows the changes in underlying transactions and hedging instruments in fair value hedging relationships recognised 
in profit and loss.

hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
linde hedges its exposure to translation risk by taking out loans in foreign currencies and by entering into forward exchange contracts 
and cross-currency interest rate swaps. these hedges generally qualify as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (referred to 
below as net investment hedges) in accordance with ifrs 9, and hence the effective portion of the hedge is transferred to equity. if the 
foreign operation is subsequently sold or relinquished, the amount recognised in equity is released to the statement of profit and loss.
     praxair has historically designated its euro-denominated notes as a hedge of the net investment position in its european operations. 
in 2014, praxair designated the €600 million 1.50% euro-denominated notes due 2020 and the €500 million ($568 million as of 31 
december 2018) 1.625% euro-denominated notes due 2025, as a hedge of the net investment position in its european operations. in 
2016, praxair designated an incremental  €550 million ($628 million as of 31 december 2018) 1.20% euro-denominated notes due 2024 
as an additional hedge of the net investment position in its european operations. 
     on 31 october 2018, praxair and linde ag combined their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction and became 
subsidiaries of linde plc. in december 2018, as a condition of the merger, praxair completed the sale of the majority of its european 
operations to taiyo nippon sanso corporation. this significantly reduced the net investment position in praxair's european operations. 
during the same month praxair also repaid the €600 million 1.50% euro-denominated notes due 2020, which significantly reduced the 
debt balance designated as a hedge. in response to the above transactions, praxair de-designated €965 million of its euro-denominated 
notes. at 31 december 2017 praxair had de-designated  €200 million of its euro-denominated notes in response to the u.s. government 
enacted tax cuts and jobs act and associated decrease in the tax rate.
     these euro-denominated debt instruments reduce the company's exposure to changes in the currency exchange rate on investments 
in foreign subsidiaries with euro-functional currencies. since hedge inception, exchange rate movements have reduced long-term debt 
by $202 million (long-term debt decreased by $105 million during the year ended 31 december 2018), with the offsetting gain shown 
within the currency translation difference component of equity in the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. 
     no amounts were recognised in 2018 or 2017 as a result of ineffectiveness in net investment hedges.
[25] consolidated statement of cash flows
the statement of cash flows shows the source and application of funds. in accordance with ias 7, cash flow statements, cash flows 
from operating activities are distinguished from cash flows from investing and financing activities. 
     the cash and cash equivalents disclosed in the statement of cash flows comprise all cash and cash equivalents disclosed in the statement 
of financial position: i.e. cash in hand, bank balances and money market funds with a maturity of three months or less. cash equivalents 
108
include an amount of $32 million (2017: $0 million) for bilateral credit support annexes. explanatory information on csas can be 
found in note 24.
     cash flows for investing and financing activities are calculated on the basis of payments, while cash flow from operating activities is 
derived indirectly from profit for the year from continuing operations.
     when the cash flow from operating activities is calculated, the changes in assets and liabilities are adjusted for certain effects, such 
as foreign currency translation. as a result, it is not possible to reconcile the figures to the differences between the headings in the published 
consolidated statement of financial position.
      distributions received and income taxes paid included in cash inflows from operating activities are disclosed separately. cash inflows 
from associates and joint ventures are disclosed in cash inflows from operating activities. finance income from embedded finance leases 
(ifric 4/ias 17) has been included in cash inflows from operating activities, due to the fact that such income is clearly related to the 
operating business of linde plc, while capitalised borrowing costs of $20 million (2017: $28 m) are disclosed in cash flows from investing 
activities. all other interest payments are disclosed in cash flow for financing activities.
     the total increase in cash and cash equivalents as a result of the business combination between praxair and linde ag is included in 
cash inflows from investing activities and was $1.4 billion. cash inflows of $5.9 billion are also included in cash inflows from investing 
activities and relate primarily to the divestiture of praxair's european industrial gases business on 3 december 2018, which was one of 
the regulatory conditions of the merger. for cash outflows relating to newly consolidated companies, please refer to the consolidated 
statement of cash flows. 
       investing activities comprise additions to and disposals of tangible assets, financial assets, intangible assets and consolidated companies. 
additions and disposals in foreign currencies have been translated at average rates.

[26] segment information
effective 31 october 2018, linde plc completed the previously announced a merger transaction pursuant to the business combination 
agreement (see notes 1 and 2 for additional information on the merger).  although it is the company’s intention to create new operating 
segments that will be used by management to allocate company resources and assess performance, due to the hold separate order with 
the u.s. federal trade commission (see note 1) it was not possible to implement this new management organization structure in calendar 
2018.  therefore, the company has added linde ag as a separate segment for 2018 reporting purposes effective with the merger date, 
which is consistent with the way the company was managed and results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. as the restrictions 
under the hold separate order was lifted effective 1 march  2019, the company implemented a new operating segment structure effective 
for 2019 reporting periods, as follows:  americas; emea (europe/ middle east/africa); apac (asia/pacific), engineering and other. 
accordingly, during 2018 the company’s operations were organized into five reportable segments, four of which have been 
determined on a geographic basis of segmentation: north america, europe, south america and asia. the company’s worldwide surface 
technologies business represents the fifth reportable segment.  as discussed above, linde ag became a sixth reportable segment effective 
with the merger on 31 october 2018. 
linde’s operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and surface technologies. the industrial gases product line 
centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon 
dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). many of these products are co-products of the same manufacturing 
process. linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. linde’s 
industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site 
or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. the distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet 
the customer’s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. therefore, the distribution economics 
are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.   
historically and through 2018, linde assessed the performance of the operating segments determined in accordance with u.s. 
gaap.  accordingly, the segment discussion that follows is based on u.s. gaap results. a reconciliation from u.s. gaap results to 
those determined under eu-ifrs for the years ended 31 december 2018 and 2017 is also provided for each segment.  linde evaluates 
the performance of its reportable segments based on operating profit, excluding the items not indicative of ongoing business trends 
(referred to as “segment operating profit”).  corporate and globally managed expenses, and research and development costs relating to 
praxair’s global industrial gases business, are allocated to operating segments based on sales. the same accounting policies as those 
set out in note 6 apply to the segments.
a brief description of the segments is given below:
north america
the north america segment includes linde’s industrial gases operations in the united states, canada and mexico.
europe
linde’s european industrial gases business operated in spain, ireland, italy, france, germany,  russia, the united kingdom, 
scandinavia and the benelux region.  in connection with the merger, praxair was required to sell the majority of its european 
industrial gases business.  the sale was completed on 3 december 2018 and the european business results are included in the

[29] transition to ifrs
  effective as of the merger date linde became praxair’s accounting successor, praxair being the accounting predecessor. for the 
periods up to and including the year ended 31 december 2017, praxair prepared its financial statement in accordance with u.s. gaap.  
linde plc, as accounting successor to praxair has adopted ifrs as of 1 january 2017, linde’s date of transition to ifrs. linde plc will 
also continue to prepare financial statements under u.s. gaap as a requirement of the nyse listing rules.
115
  accordingly, linde plc has prepared these financial statements as at 31 december 2018, together with the comparative period 
data for the year ended 31 december 2017, as described in the summary of significant accounting policies in accordance with ifrs. 
linde’s opening statement of financial position was prepared as at1 january 2017. 
  this note explains the principal adjustments made by the company in restating praxair's u.s. gaap financial statements, 
including the statement of financial position as at 1 january 2017 and the financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017. 
exemptions applied
  ifrs 1 first-time adoption of international financial reporting standards allows first-time adopters certain exemptions from 
the retrospective application of ifrs. linde has applied the following exemptions:
•  ifrs 3 business combinations has not been applied to business combinations or acquisitions of interests in associates and joint 
ventures that have occurred before 1 january 2017. the u.s. gaap carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, that are required 
to be recognized under ifrs, are their deemed cost at the date of the acquisition. assets and liabilities that do not qualify for 
recognition under ifrs would have to be excluded from the opening ifrs statement of financial position. linde did not recognize 
or exclude any previously recognized amounts as a result of the ifrs recognition requirements. ifrs 1 also requires that the 
u.s. gaap carrying amount of goodwill must be used in the opening ifrs statement of financial position and tested for 
impairment at the date of transition to ifrs. no goodwill impairment was deemed necessary by linde at 1 january 2017.
•  linde has elected to not apply ifrs 2 share-based payment retrospectively to equity-settled share-based payment transactions 
that have already vested at the date of transition to ifrs. for cash-settled share-based payment transactions, linde has not 
applied ifrs 2 to liabilities that were settled before 1 january 2017.
•  linde did not reassess the determination of whether an arrangement contained a lease as linde made the same determination of 
whether an arrangement contained a lease in accordance with u.s. gaap as that required by ifric 4 determining whether an 
arrangement contains a lease.
•  linde has elected to deem the cumulative exchange differences on translation of foreign operations to be zero as at 1 january 
2017.
•  linde has elected to apply ifrs 9 financial instruments prospectively to transactions for which it has determined that the fair 
value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price entered into.
•  ifric 1  changes  in  existing  decommissioning,  restoration  and  similar  liabilities  requires  specified  changes  in  a 
decommissioning, restoration or similar liability to be added or deducted from the cost of the asset to which it relates. linde 
elected to measure the liability in accordance with ias 37 provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets and to 
estimate the amount to include in cost of the asset based on the facts and circumstances that existed on 1 january 2017.
•  linde has elected to not restate the borrowing cost component that was capitalized under u.s. gaap in the carrying amount of 
assets prior to 1 january 2017 and accounts for borrowing costs incurred on or after 1 january 2017 in accordance with ias 23 
borrowing costs, including those borrowing costs incurred on or after that date on qualifying assets already under construction.
•  linde has elected to apply the transition provisions in ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers and (i) did not restate 
contracts that were completed before 1 january 2017  or contracts that begin and end in the same reporting period, (ii) for 
completed contracts that have variable consideration, used the transaction price at the date the contract was completed, did not 
restate contracts for any modifications that occurred before 1 january 2017 and (iii) for the reporting periods presented before 
1 january 2018 did not disclose the amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations and an 
explanation of when the entity expects to recognize that amount as revenue.
•  linde has elected not to apply ifric 22 foreign currency transactions and advance consideration to assets, expenses and 
income initially recognized before 1 january 2017. 
estimates
the estimates at 1 january 2017 and at 31 december 2017 are consistent with those made for the same dates in accordance with 
u.s. gaap (after adjustments to reflect any differences in accounting policies). the estimates used by the company to present these 
amounts in accordance with ifrs reflect conditions at 1 january 2017, the date of transition to ifrs and as at 31 december 2017.
reconciliation from u.s. gaap to ifrs
in preparing the consolidated financial statements under ifrs, linde adjusted the amounts reported in the consolidated financial 
statements under u.s. gaap. the impacts of these adjustments are as follows:

assets have been historically included in other long-term assets and have been reclassified to each of their respective captions, 
consistent with linde plc presentation.
b.  accounts receivables 
accounts receivables is reclassified to trade receivables. receivables from finance leases and other receivables and other assets 
has been historically included in accounts receivable and have been reclassified to each of their respective captions, consistent 
with linde plc presentation.
c.  prepaid and other current assets
120
prepaid and other current assets are reclassified to other receivables and other assets. income tax receivables have been historically 
included in prepaid and other current assets and has been reclassified to its respective caption, consistent with linde plc.
d.  accumulated deferred gains and losses 
accumulated deferred gains and losses related to pensions and other post employee plans included in other reserves are reclassified 
to retained earnings, consistent with linde plc presentation.
e.  deferred credits
deferred credits are reclassified to deferred tax liabilities. other non-current liabilities have been historically included in deferred 
charges and have been reclassified to its respective caption, consistent with linde plc presentation.
f.  provisions for pensions
provisions for pensions and similar obligations and other non-current provisions have been historically included in other non-
current liabilities and are reclassified to each of their respective captions, consistent with linde plc presentation.
g.  non-current liabilities from finance leases
liabilities from finance leases (non-current) have been historically included in financial debt (non-current) and are reclassified 
to its caption, consistent with linde plc presentation.
h.  current liabilities from finance leases and debt
liabilities from finance leases (current) and the portion of financial debt (current) that is due within one year which had an 
original maturity date greater than one year have been historically included within current portion of long-term debt and are 
reclassified to their respective captions, consistent with linde plc presentation.
i.  current provisions
current provisions is reclassified from other current liabilities to current provisions, consistent with linde plc presentation.
  ifrs reclassifications and remeasurements:
j.  intangible assets
under u.s. gaap, software is classified as property, plant and equipment. under ifrs, software is presented in other intangible 
assets and as such software is reclassified to other intangible assets.
k.  taxes
under u.s. gaap, the uncertain tax positions are classified as other non-current liabilities. under ifrs, income tax reserves 
for uncertain tax positions are classified as current and as such uncertain tax positions are reclassified to current. 
l.  mezzanine equity
ifrs does not allow for a mezzanine-equity presentation and accordingly, redeemable noncontrolling has been reclassified to 
other non-current liabilities.
m.  severance accrual
linde recognizes severance accruals based on expected employee termination under u.s. gaap. the obligation is recognized 
before the employee formally accepts the severance offer and therefore is derecognized under ifrs. accordingly, other current 
liabilities and other non-current liabilities decreased under ifrs.
n.  pension adjustment
ifrs requires the discount rate selected to measure pensions to be the best estimate of unbiased actuarial assumptions. therefore, 
under ifrs linde derives the discount rate from corporate bonds that represent the "universe" of bonds in the denominated 
currency's market. this population of the bonds does not exclude outliers. the actuarial method used to determine the discount 
rate under u.s. gaap is the 90/40 method. in a range of bond interest rates, the bottom 40% and top 10% of bond interest rates 
are removed from the population used to estimate the discount rate. the resulting adjustment was recognized against retained 
earnings.
o.  foreign currency
under u.s. gaap, the company recognized translation differences on foreign operations in a separate component of equity. 
cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations are set to zero as at 1 january 2017. the resulting adjustment 
was recognized against retained earnings.
p.  deferred taxes
121
under u.s. gaap, the company recognized deferred taxes on share-based compensation expense to the extent of the amount 
of underlying expense, however, under ifrs the associated deferred tax assets are recognized at fair value.  the deferred tax 
impact on the other transition adjustments were not material.
q.  classification of long-term debt due within one year
under u.s. gaap, a company may recognize the current portion of long-term debt as long-term if the company has the ability 
and intent to refinance this debt through an existing credit facility on a long-term basis.  this is not allowed under ifrs and as 
such the portion of this debt was reclassified as current.

line item within the statement of income by praxair. the cost reduction program and other charges have been reclassified to

  ifrs reclassifications and remeasurements:
g.  taxes
under ifrs, deferred taxes that were originally recorded through other comprehensive income are adjusted back in other 
comprehensive income for the effect of the tax rate change. under u.s. gaap, such tax rate change adjustments are required 
to be recorded as an adjustment to profit and loss. accordingly, an adjustment was recorded to eliminate the amount recorded 
through profit and loss statement for u.s. gaap purposes.
h.  pensions
linde accounts for its pensions under ifrs, and as such, there are several differences compared to u. s. gaap.
•  under u.s. gaap the expected return on plan assets is recognized as income in the period whereas under ifrs the 
interest income is calculated as the product of the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation each as of the 
beginning of the annual period and the fair value of the plan asset.
•  actuarial gains and losses recorded in oci are recognized in net income in subsequent reporting periods under u.s. 
gaap whereas under ifrs remeasurement gains and losses, including actuarial gains and losses are not subsequently 
recognized into net income.
•  prior service costs are initially recognized through oci and are recognized in net income in subsequent periods under 
u.s. gaap versus immediately recognized in net income under ifrs. 
•  under ifrs, only the change in the benefit obligation will be recognized as a result of a curtailment, since there are 
no unrecognized prior service costs or gains and losses. under u.s. gaap, unrecognized prior service costs or credits 
relating to previous plan amendments are recognized in a curtailment together with the portion, if any, of the decrease 
or increase in the benefit obligation that exceeds unrecognized actuarial losses or gains, respectively. further, the timing 
for recognizing the effects of a curtailment under u.s. gaap differs depending on whether a curtailment gain or loss 
has occurred (curtailment losses may be recognized in an earlier period than curtailment gains). the timing for 
recognizing the effects of a curtailment under ifrs is the same for both an increase and a decrease in the defined benefit 
obligation. in addition, the elimination of the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of the future services of a 
significant number of employees is accounted for as a curtailment under u.s. gaap. under ifrs, the elimination of 
benefits is accounted for as a plan amendment, i.e. immediately recognized in net income under ifrs. 
•  under ifrs, the settlement gain or loss is measured as the difference between the benefit obligation being settled and 
the settlement price. under u.s. gaap, the settlement gain or loss includes a portion of unrecognized actuarial gains 
or losses. in addition, under asc 715, an employer can elect to not account for settlement gains or losses, as long as 
payments made do not exceed the sum of the plan’s total service cost and interest cost for that year (known as the 
“settlement threshold”). such payments will be treated as normal benefit payments. settlement accounting also may 
be applied if the amount of lump-sum payments is below the threshold, if this approach is applied consistently from 
year to year. ifrs does not have a minimum threshold for recognizing settlements. however, if an existing benefit plan 
provides plan participants with an option to choose a lump-sum payment at retirement, instead of ongoing annuity 
123
payments, participants’ decisions to receive those lump-sum payments are accounted for as benefit payments, rather 
than as settlements.
•  the expected return on plan assets and the interest expenses is presented in cost of sales under u.s. gaap whereas 
under ifrs the interest on the net liability is presented as interest expense. 
  statement of cash-flows
  there were no material adjustments as a result of the transition to ifrs as it relates to the statement of cash flows.

guarantee agreements
contingent liabilities arise at linde from guarantees, among other things. see litigation section below for more information regarding 
the guarantees.
other contingent liabilities mainly include penalties and interest for a potential subsequent tax payment in india. judicial proceedings 
have been ongoing in this matter for some years now. it is not possible to reliably pinpoint the timing of potential cash outflows. there 
is no entitlement to reimbursement. 
other contingencies
the engineering division regularly enters into contracts with consortium partners to build turnkey industrial plants, under which 
the consortium partners assume joint and several liability to the customer for the total volume of the contract. there are clear internal 
rules here as to how the liability should be split between the partners. at present, there are plant construction orders with one of our 
consortium partners totaling $16 million (2017: $0 million). 
other financial commitments
other financial commitments include lease commitments relating to operating leases and commitments relating to orders. 
commitments relating to orders are in respect of open orders for which a contractual payment obligation has already been agreed.

the minimum lease payments relate to leased buildings, technical equipment, fixtures, furniture and equipment (procurement 
leases). some of the lease agreements contain extension clauses, purchase options or price adjustment clauses customary in the 
market.
they are in respect of a large number of individual contracts. in the 2018 financial year, costs arising from operating leases of 
$193 million (2017: $146 million) were recognised.
litigation
125
  linde is subject to various lawsuits and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. 
these actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others. linde has strong defenses 
in these cases and intends to defend itself vigorously. it is possible that the company may incur losses in connection with some of 
these actions in excess of accrued liabilities. management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material 
adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have 
a significant impact on the company’s reported results of operations in any given period.significant matters are:
•  during may 2009, the brazilian government published law 11941/2009 instituting a new voluntary amnesty program (“refis 
program”) which allowed brazilian companies to settle certain federal tax disputes at reduced amounts. during the 2009 third 
quarter, praxair decided that it was economically beneficial to settle many of its outstanding federal tax disputes and such disputes 
were enrolled in the refis program, subject to final calculation and review by the brazilian federal government. the company 
recorded estimated liabilities based on the terms of the refis program. since 2009, praxair has been unable to reach final 
agreement on the calculations and initiated litigation against the government in an attempt to resolve certain items. open issues 
relate to the following matters: (i) application of cash deposits and net operating loss carryforwards to satisfy obligations and 
(ii) the amount of tax reductions available under the refis program. it is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of legal 
matters in brazil.
•  31 december 2018 the most significant non-income and income tax claims in brazil, after enrollment in the refis program, 
relate to state vat tax matters and a federal income tax matter where the taxing authorities are challenging the tax rate that 
should be applied to income generated by a subsidiary company. the total estimated exposure relating to such claims, including 
interest and penalties, as appropriate, is approximately $205 million. linde has not recorded any liabilities related to such claims 
based on management judgments, after considering judgments and opinions of outside counsel. because litigation in brazil 
historically takes many years to resolve, it is very difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of these matters; however, it is 
possible that certain of these matters may be resolved within the near term. the company is vigorously defending against the 
proceedings.
•   on 1 september 2010, cade ("brazilian administrative council for economic defense") announced alleged anticompetitive 
activity on the part of five industrial gas companies in brazil and imposed fines on all five companies. originally, cade imposed 
a civil fine of r$2.2 billion brazilian reais ($568 million) against white martins, the brazil-based subsidiary of praxair. in 
response to a motion for clarification, the fine was reduced to r$1.7 billion brazilian reais ($439 million) due to a calculation 
error made by cade. the amount of the fine is subject to indexation using selic. on 2 september 2010, praxair issued a press 
release and filed a report on form 8-k rejecting all claims and stating that the fine represents a gross and arbitrary disregard of 
brazilian law.
on 19 october 2010, white martins filed an annulment petition (“appeal”) with the federal court in brasilia seeking to have 
the fine against white martins entirely overturned. in order to suspend payment of the fine pending the completion of the 
appeal process, brazilian law required that the company tender a form of guarantee in the amount of the fine as security. 
initially, 50% of the guarantee was satisfied by letters of credit with a financial institution and 50% by equity of a brazilian 
subsidiary. on 15 april 2016, the ninth federal court in brasilia allowed white martins to withdraw and cancel the letters of 
credit. accordingly, the guarantee is currently satisfied solely by equity of a brazilian subsidiary.
on september 14, 2015, the ninth federal court of brasilia overturned the fine against white martins and declared the 
original cade administrative proceeding to be null and void. on 30 june 2016, cade filed an appeal against this decision 
with the federal circuit court in brasilia.  praxair strongly believes that the allegations are without merit and that the fine 
will be entirely overturned during the appeal process. the company further believes that it has strong defenses and will 
vigorously defend against the allegations and related fine up to such levels of the federal courts in brazil as may be 
necessary. because appeals in brazil historically take many years to resolve, it is very difficult to estimate when the appeal 
will be finally decided. based on management judgments, after considering judgments and opinions of outside counsel, no 
reserve has been recorded for this proceeding as management does not believe that a loss is probable.
•  as stated above, in 2010, the brazilian competition authority cade imposed fines on a number of gases companies, including 
linde ag’s brazilian subsidiary, on the grounds of alleged anti-competitive business conduct. cade imposed a fine of 
approximately r$188 million brazilian reais ($49 million) on linde ag’s brazilian subsidiary. based on the fact that the fine 
has been overturned by a federal court in the first instance and on a subsequent appeal by cade, linde believes that this decision 
will not stand up to judicial review in the third instance either, and deems the possibility of cash outflows to be extremely unlikely. 
as a result, no reserve has been recorded for this proceeding as management does not believe that a loss is probable.

[34] events after the reporting date
treasury shares
on 22 january 2019 the company’s board of directors approved the repurchase of $6.0 billion of its ordinary shares ("2019 program") 
which could take place from time to time on the open market (which could include the use of 10b5-1 trading plans), subject to market 
and business conditions. the 2019 program has a maximum repurchase amount of 15% of outstanding shares and a stated expiration date 
of 1 february 2021.

notes to the company financial statements
1.  organization and basis of presentation
linde plc, formerly known as zamalight plc ("linde plc" or the “company”), was incorporated as a public limited company under the 
laws of ireland on 18 april 2017, by enceladus holding limited ("enceladus") and cumberland corporate services limited 
("cumberland"), with an issued share capital of €25,000 ($26,827),  comprised of 25,000 a ordinary shares with a nominal value of €1.00 
each, and additional paid in capital of €25,000 ($26,827).  the a ordinary shares of €1.00 each were initially issued on linde plc’s 
incorporation as ordinary shares. these shares were subsequently re-designated as a ordinary shares on 25 july 2017.  zamalight plc was 
renamed "linde plc" on 20 july 2017.
the company is registered in ireland under the registration number 602527 and with its registered office located at ten earlsfort terrace, 
dublin 2, d02 t380 ireland and principal executive offices at the priestley centre, 10 priestley road, surrey research park, guildford, 
surrey gu2 7xy, united kingdom. 
the company was formed in accordance with the requirements of the business combination agreement, dated as of 1 june 2017, as 
amended (the "business combination agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, praxair, inc., a delaware corporation (together 
with its subsidiaries, “praxair”) and linde ag, a german stock corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “linde”) agreed to combine 
their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction, and become subsidiaries of the company.
during the period linde plc made an offer to exchange each issued and outstanding no-par value bearer share of linde ag for 1.540 
ordinary shares of linde plc (the “exchange offer”).  in addition, zamalight subco, inc., an  indirect wholly-owned delaware subsidiary 
of linde plc, merged with and into praxair, inc., with praxair, inc. surviving the merger (the “merger”, and together with the exchange 
offer, the “business combination” ). in the merger, each share of praxair, inc. common stock converted into the right to receive one linde 
plc ordinary share.  praxair, inc.’s stockholders approved the merger at praxair, inc.’s special meeting held on 27 september 2017 and 
on 24 november 2017, the tender period for the exchange offer expired with approximately 92% of all linde ag shares entitled to voting 
rights being tendered.  
the merger completed on 31 october 2018, following which us$47.360 billion was added to the company’s share premium account in 
accordance with section 71(5) of the companies act 2014. in accordance with section 72 of the companies act 2014 (which applies to 
a scenario where a company acquires 90% of the equity share capital in another company (including any body corporate for the purpose 
of the companies act 2014) in consideration for the allotment of shares to the selling shareholders of that other company), the value 
received by the company in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary shares issued by it as consideration for the exchange offer, being 
$42.455 billion, was credited to a “merger reserve”.
linde plc listed its ordinary shares on the new york stock exchange and the frankfurt stock exchange, and is included in the s&p 500 
and dax 30 indices.
on 1 november 2018, the company implemented a multiple step process to covert the “merger reserve” to share premium as follows:
1.  designated a series of preferred shares of €0.001 each in the capital of the company (the “series a preferred shares”) in 
accordance with article 6 of the articles of association of the company carrying the rights and subject to the limitations set 
out in that designation (the “designation”);
2.  allotted and issued in accordance with section 1021 of the act of one series a preferred share for an aggregate cash 
consideration of €1.00 (the “share issue”) to enceladus holding limited, a nominee entity (the “subscriber”);
3.  capitalised the entire amount standing to the credit of the merger reserve by making a bonus issue in accordance with section 
1021 of the act and article 95 of the articles of association of the company of one series a preferred share to the 
subscriber paid up to the entire amount of the merger reserve (the “bonus issue”); and
4.  acquired for nil consideration and cancelled the two series a preferred shares in issue immediately after completion of the 
bonus issue in accordance with the terms of the designation and section 102 of the act (the “acquisition and cancellation” 
and, together with the designation, the share issue, the bonus issue and the acquisition and cancellation, the “capital 
conversion”).
following completion of the capital conversion, the entire amount standing to the credit of the company’s share premium account was 
$89.816 billion.
on 30 november 2018, the irish high court approved the creation of distributable reserves of the company, linde plc through the 
reduction of the share premium account by $89.816 billion. this resulted in a transfer of reserves from the share premium account to the 
profit and loss account of the same amount.
134
the principal activity of linde plc, the legal entity,  is to act an investment holding company. 
2.  statement of compliance
the company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards issued by the financial 
reporting council and promulgated by the institute of chartered accountants in ireland, including frs 102, ‘the financial reporting 
standard applicable in the uk and republic of ireland’ and the irish companies act 2014. 
3.  summary of significant accounting policies
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. it also requires management to 
exercise its judgment in the process of applying the company’s accounting policies. the significant accounting policies used in the 
preparation of the entity financial statements are set out below. these policies have been consistently applied to all financial years 
presented, unless otherwise stated. 
basis of preparation
the financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, in usd which is the functional currency of the company and 
rounded to the nearest million usd.
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts 
reported for assets and liabilities as at the statement of financial position date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during 
the year. however, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
the financial statements present the entity financial position for the year ended 31 december  2018. comparative information is for the 
period from the date of incorporation, 18 april 2017 to 31 december 2017.
transition for frs 102
this is the first financial year that the company has presented its results under frs 102.  the last financial statements under international 
financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu ("ifrs") were for the financial period ended 31 december 2017.  the date of 
transition to frs 102 was 19 april 2017.  there were no measurement adjustments arising from the company's transition to frs 102 at 
19 april 2017 or at the comparative date 31 december 2017.  
in accordance with section 304 of the companies act 2014, the company is availing of the exemption from presenting its individual profit 
and loss account to the annual general meeting and from filing it with the registrar of companies. 
disclosure exemptions
frs 102 allows a qualifying entity certain disclosure exemptions. the company is a qualifying entity and has availed of the following 
disclosure exemptions:
i.  exemption from the requirements of section 7 of frs 102 and frs 102 paragraph 3.17(d) to present a statement of cash flows.
ii.  exemption from the financial instrument disclosure requirements of section 11 paragraphs 11.39 to 11.48a and section 12 
paragraphs 12.26 to 12.29a of frs 102 as the equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated financial statements of 
the company in which the entity is consolidated.
iii.  exemption from certain disclosure requirements of section 26 of frs 102 (paragraphs 26.18(b), 26.19 to 26.21 and 26.23), in 
respect of share-based payments as the share-based payment concerns its own equity instruments and its separate financial 
statements are presented alongside the consolidated financial statements of the company; and the equivalent disclosures are 
included in the consolidated financial statements of the company in which the entity is consolidated.
iv.  exemption from the requirement of frs 102 paragraph 33.7 to disclose key management personnel compensation in total.
v.  exemption from the requirement of frs 102 paragraph 4.12(a)(iv) to disclose a reconciliation of the number of shares outstanding 
at the beginning and end of the year.
critical accounting judgments and estimation uncertainty
estimates and judgments made in the process of preparing the entity financial statements are continually evaluated and are based on 
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
135
critical accounting estimates and assumptions
the estimation process required to prepare the company’s financial statements requires assumptions to be made about future events and 
conditions, and as such, is inherently subjective and uncertain. the company’s actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
carrying value of investment in subsidiary
the company is a holding company and at the statement of financial position has an investment in subsidiary carried at cost of $ 89.8 
billion. the investment is reviewed for impairment indicators. recoverability of the investment is dependent on the financial condition 
of the subsidiaries of the company. as of 31 december 2018, no impairments were noted.
foreign currency translation
items included in these financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates (‘the functional currency’). the financial information is presented in u.s. dollars ("usd"). 
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. foreign 
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognised in profit and loss. 
shares in group undertakings
shares in group undertakings are stated in the company’s statement of financial position at cost less any return of capital, unless it has 
been impaired in which case it is carried at net of any impairment loss recognized.
cash at bank and in-hand
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at banks or other highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less.
financial instruments
the company has chosen to apply the provisions of sections 11 and 12 of frs 102 to account for all of its financial instruments.
financial assets
basic financial assets, including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents are initially recognized at transaction price 
(including transaction costs), unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction. where the arrangement constitutes a financing 
transaction the resulting financial asset is initially measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of 
interest for a similar debt instrument.
at the end of each financial year, financial assets measured at amortized cost are assessed for objective evidence of impairment. if there 
is objective evidence that a financial asset measured at amortized cost is impaired an impairment loss is recognized in profit and loss. 
the impairment loss is the difference between the financial asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the financial asset’s estimated 
cash inflows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. no impairments were recognized in the periods ended 31 december 
2018 or 31 december 2017.
financial assets are derecognized when (a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are settled, or (b) substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred to another party or (c) control of the financial asset has been 
transferred to another party who has the practical ability to unilaterally sell the financial asset to an unrelated third party without imposing 
additional restrictions.
financial liabilities
basic financial liabilities, including accrued liabilities, and amounts due to related parties, are initially recognized at transaction price, 
unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction. where the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction the resulting financial 
liability is initially measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.
amounts due to related parties, and financial liability from arrangements which constitute financing transactions are subsequently carried 
at amortized cost, using the effective interest method.
financial liabilities are derecognized when the liability is extinguished, that is when the contractual obligation is discharged, cancelled 
or expires.
share capital
ordinary shares are classified as equity.  incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are capitalized and upon the 
closing of the associated equity transaction are reclassified to equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
136
treasury shares
treasury shares comprise the company’s ordinary shares that have been purchased under the company’s approved share buyback programs 
which allow for the the repurchase of ordinary shares from time to time in the open market subject to market and business conditions. 
subsequent sales, transfers or cancellations of treasury shares held by the company are accounted for within equity.
income taxes
the company establishes provisions based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the 
respective countries in which it operates. the amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience with previous 
tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. 
management estimation is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon likely timing and 
level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. 
the income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the applicable income 
tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused 
tax losses. current tax is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the taxable profit for the financial year or past financial years. 
current tax is measured at the amount of current tax that is expected to be paid using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the financial year.
deferred tax assets are recognized only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilize those temporary differences 
and losses. no deferred tax has been recognized as at the dates of the statement of financial position, as the company has recently been 
incorporated and therefore does not have any history of income.
dividends
dividends and other distributions to company’s equity shareholders are recognized as a liability in the financial statements in the financial 
year in which the dividends and other distributions are approved by the company’s shareholders.
other debtors
other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. other 
receivables are stated at the lower of amortized cost or recoverable amount. if collection of the amounts is expected in one year or less 
they are classified as current assets.
share-based compensation
the company and its subsidiaries operate various share based payment plans.  see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for 
details on the share based payment plans.
the share based payment expense associated with the share plans is recognized as an expense by the entity which receives services in 
exchange for the share based compensation.  in these company only financial statements, the expense related to the options vested is 
recorded in other reserves and recorded as a capital contribution to the appropriate entity that receives the services of the employees.

combined non-financial report 
linde plc ("linde" or the "company") publishes non-financial indicators and qualitative information in this combined non-
financial report in accordance with the irish implementation of the european directives 2014/95/eu and 2013/34/eu as set out in the 
european union (disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups) regulations 2017, 
as amended (the “irish regulations”).
this combined non-financial report forms part of the 2018 directors' report. it includes reportable information on board of 
directors (the "board") diversity and on company social and employee matters; environmental matters; combating bribery and 
corruption and respect for human rights. reportable information includes governance, policies, due diligence in implementing these 
policies and the outcomes of these actions, risk identification and management, and key performance indicators ("kpis").
linde plc was created to effect the merger of two companies,  praxair, inc. ("praxair") and linde aktiengesellschaft ("linde 
ag"), which was consummated on 31 october 2018. divestitures were required on both sides. after the merger both companies 
operated under a hold separate order until 1 march 2019 with rules restricting information exchange or collaboration. in this context, 
board and management decisions have not yet been made on a combined sustainable development strategy or related kpis and targets. 
those management decisions are expected during 2019. where possible and relevant, these will be provided in linde’s voluntary 
sustainability report which will be published in july 2019. nevertheless, linde’s corporate governance structure, core values, key 
policies and non-financial compensation incentives are in place and are the focus of this report. 
2018 data provided in this report follow the scope of linde's 2018 financial reporting. where full year 2018 numbers are 
provided, linde reports a full calendar year for legacy praxair as a successor in interest and two months for legacy linde ag. data 
provided for 2017 reflects results for praxair.
business model and strategy
     the business model of linde is described in the "principal activities" section of the directors' report. 
risk management
main risks are reported in sections relating to environmental matters; social and employee matters; human rights; and bribery 
and corruption; as well as action towards their mitigation. in addition, the section “principal risks and uncertainties” describes further 
risks related to the above matters which could have an adverse financial impact on linde as well as connected non-financial risks.
issues relating to non-financial matters are included in the company-wide enterprise risk management system. the company 
assesses potential risks on a regular basis and defines and implements mitigation actions. this process also incorporates relevant 
conclusions from its regular dialog with stakeholders, including customers, investors and suppliers.
governance of non-financial matters
linde has established five core values: safety, inclusion, accountability, integrity and community. these are the basis of what the 
company stands for and how it behaves. a code of ethics has been adopted that provides clear instructions on expected behavior and 
for reporting of concerns about potential non-conformance. this code has been approved by the linde board of directors and is 
named the “code of business integrity”. this document is made widely available to employees and third parties and is posted on the 
company’s public website.
it is the view of linde’s board that non-financial issues are a component of the company's values, culture and performance 
expectations, and are a basis on which employees drive financial results. the board has confirmed the importance of setting non-
financial objectives as part of variable compensation to reinforce leadership’s focus on maintaining a culture that supports both short- 
and long-term sustainable results. it has established non-financial goals with respect to elements such as safety, environmental 
responsibility, global compliance, productivity and talent management. these measures are described in linde’s april 2019 proxy 
statement. annual payout of executive variable compensation will depend on performance in several strategic non-financial areas, 
including compliance. 
linde’s board monitors the implementation of its code of business integrity which includes commitments to adhere to high 
standards for diversity and inclusion; safety, health, care for the environment and quality; human rights, corporate citizenship and the 
prevention of bribery and corruption. the audit committee oversees the company’s compliance with legal and regulatory 
requirements. the compensation committee oversees diversity and inclusion policies, objectives and programs to achieve those 
141
objectives. the nomination & governance committee has responsibility to periodically review the company’s guidelines and policies 
governing its response to important broad public policy issues in the areas of corporate social responsibility and corporate citizenship. 
linde leadership develops policies and processes to reinforce these non-financial elements.
     for purposes of external reporting, linde consolidates and reports non-financial issues from its sustainable development 
function, which is also the central point of contact for stakeholders interested in sustainability-related matters. sustainability is 
managed by the global head of sustainable development, reporting to the executive vice president for global functions.
board diversity
the board acknowledges the importance of ensuring that it has the mix of perspectives, skills, experience, qualities and 
competencies that is appropriate to the company's strategies, and its business, market, geographic, and regulatory environments. the 
board also recognizes that its effectiveness is dependent on having directors who have the time to focus on the company’s issues and 
who contribute to an open board culture that encourages frank discussion and the free exchange of information. 
in considering its corporate governance structure, linde reviewed the standards of recognized governance organizations and of 
peer firms. among the elements deemed relevant was board diversity. consistent with the board’s corporate governance guidelines, 
the nominating and governance committee seeks to build and maintain a board that contains a range of experiences, competencies, 
and perspectives that is well-suited for advice and counsel to, and oversight of, the company’s business and operations. in doing so, 
the committee takes into account a variety of factors, including the mix of experiences, competencies, and perspectives (including 
gender, ethnic and cultural diversity) currently represented on the board.
the nomination & governance committee assists the board in its oversight of the selection, qualifications, compensation and 
performance of linde’s directors and is responsible for evaluating the mix of board member skills required in connection with filling 
any vacancy on the board. it maintains a process to establish and periodically reevaluate criteria for board membership and selection 
of new directors including independence standards; and determines as necessary the portfolio of skills, experience, perspective and 
background required for the effective functioning of the board considering the company's strategy and its regulatory, geographic and 
market environments.
 on 31 december 2018, the board of directors of linde was 75 percent male and 25 percent female, representing a balanced 
mix of skills, professional and educational backgrounds, including among others mechanical/industrial engineering, economics, law, 
natural sciences and business administration. see the table at the end of this section: "indicators relating to board diversity and 
employee-related matters". each of the directors has experience as a senior executive of a public company or comparable business 
organization. each is serving or has served as a director of one or more public companies and on a variety of board committees. each 
has executive management and director oversight experience in most, if not all of the following areas considered critical to the 
conduct of the company’s business. these include: strategy development and implementation; risk assessment and management; 
financial accounting and reporting; internal controls; corporate finance; capital project evaluation; the evaluation, compensation, 
motivation and retention of senior executive talent; public policies as they affect global industrial corporations; compliance; corporate 
governance; productivity management; safety management; project management; sustainable development; and, in most cases, global 
operations. many of the directors also bring particular insights into specific end markets and foreign markets that are important to the 
company. these nominees collectively provide a range of perspectives, experiences and competencies well suited to providing advice 
and counsel to management and to overseeing the company’s business and operations. 
social and employee-related matters
occupational health and safety
there is inherent operational risk in the management of linde’s production facilities and delivery systems, including storage, 
vehicle transportation and pipelines. material operating failures at production, storage facilities or pipelines, including fire, toxic 
release and explosions, or the occurrence of vehicle transportation accidents could result in loss of life or present safety risks to 
employees, business partners, communities and the environment.
safety is a core value for linde and is always a first priority. linde continuously works to improve its safety culture and 
performance worldwide. linde’s worldwide health, safety & environment (“hse”) policy reinforces its ambition of zero incidents 
causing harm to people, communities or the environment. it asserts that all incidents and injuries are preventable and that each linde 
employee is responsible for their own safety and that of others around them. the policy is widely communicated to employees and 
third parties and is made available on linde's public website. linde is also a signatory of the global chemical industry responsible 
142
care global charter®. global operations adhere to the guidelines of the responsible care® program and to linde’s global safety 
management system, which is based on best industry standards and practice.
linde’s full board of directors has responsibility to review safety and environmental risk at each board meeting. the board has 
established a strategic business objective to maintain best-in-class performance in safety. annual payout of executive variable 
compensation will depend on performance in several strategic non-financial areas, including safety. safety and health issues are 
managed by the global head of the safety, health, environment & quality ("sheq") function reporting to the executive vice 
president for global functions. 
 linde’s safety culture is embedded into all operational processes and in transport and distribution. linde’s strong worldwide 
safety and health management system ensures that measures are in place to enable process, personnel, product and distribution safety. 
these measures are communicated to all employees and relevant business partners and contractors, who are regularly trained in the 
safe handling of linde’s products and are expected to adhere to the same high standards. safety performance is monitored 
continuously in all businesses and reported monthly and on a major event basis to leadership. 
linde is in the process of aligning the respective programs of the linde and praxair legacy companies into comprehensive 
safety, security and environmental standards and procedures for work processes as well as product handling, to enable employees 
around the world to execute their jobs safely and prevent safety incidents relating to operational processes or products. 
due to the hold separate period management decisions have not yet been made on joint kpis. these will be reported in linde's 
voluntary sustainability report in july 2019.
employees
on 31 december 2018, linde had 80,946 employees in diverse occupations working in more than 100 countries (praxair 2017: 
26,461 employees). personnel expenses in 2018 totaled $2,793 million (2017: $2,059 million), of which $1,872 million (2017: $1,353 
million) related to salaries (including social security contributions) and $153 million (2017: $93 million) to pensions. 
the company sources talent from an ever-changing and competitive environment. the ability to source and retain qualified and 
committed employees is a prerequisite for the company’s success, and represents a general risk for linde, including in the context of 
the business combination. 
inclusion is a linde core value. the company embraces diversity and inclusion in order to attract, develop and retain the best 
talent and build high-performing teams. by hearing all voices and benefiting from diverse opinions, thoughts and perspectives, the 
company can achieve its full promise and potential. its code of business integrity states that employees must not be discriminated 
against on the basis of their race, color, religion, gender, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, pregnancy,  
sexual orientation or other protected characteristic.
the board has established a strategic business objective to maintain world-class standards in talent management. executive 
variable compensation will be assessed annually based on performance in several strategic non-financial areas, including talent 
management. the compensation committee assists the board in its oversight of linde’s compensation and incentive policies and 
programs, and management development and succession, particularly in regard to reviewing executive compensation for linde’s 
executive officers. the committee also periodically reviews the company’s diversity policies and objectives, and programs to achieve 
those objectives. the global head of human resources reports to the chief executive officer ("ceo"). a global leader of diversity 
and inclusion reports to the head of human resources. 
linde has aligned diversity and inclusion with its business strategies and implemented diversity action planning into business 
process and performance management. diversity and inclusion are line management responsibilities and linde seeks competitive 
advantage through proactive management of its talent pipeline, procurement and recruiting processes. linde provides equal 
employment opportunity, and recruits, hires, promotes and compensates people based solely on their merit and ability.
employees receive a competitive salary and variable remuneration components based on merit and depending on their position. 
linde has collective bargaining agreements with unions at numerous locations throughout the world. additional benefits are offered 
such as occupational pensions and contributions towards health insurance or medical screening, reflecting regional conditions and 
local competition. managers’ compensation is based on performance. senior managers participate directly in the company’s growth in 
value through the long term incentive plan of linde plc. work-life balance is promoted by providing a range of opportunities that are 
based on the overall local conditions. linde also invests in professional development of its employees through formal and on-the-job 
training.

     on 31 december 2018, the total workforce was 28 percent women and 72 percent men. the table at the end of this section provides 
2017 data for praxair as a predecessor in interest and 2018 data for linde plc. 
     due to the hold separate period management decisions on additional employee-related kpis have not yet been made. these will be 
reported in linde's voluntary sustainability report in july 2019.

* all 2017 numbers are provided for legacy praxair, inc. only. the proportion of females at first management tier below leadership of 
linde plc in 2018 is not considered comparable to the praxair value in 2017 because of significantly different organizational 
structures, therefore the 2017 value is shown as “not applicable”. 
community engagement
community is a core value. linde is committed to improving the communities where employees live and work. its charitable 
contributions, along with employee voluntarism, support initiatives that make important and sustainable contributions to the world. 
this includes educational investments and research projects related to core business areas and supporting charitable projects in 
communities and neighborhoods. charitable contributions are mainly made through the global giving program.
 employee community engagement in all businesses and functions is promoted from the sustainable development department. in 
2018, linde employee volunteers carried out more than 100 community engagement projects benefiting around 100,000 children and 
students in our communities around the world.
environmental matters
linde’s business is resource transformation through resource productivity. principal operations relate to the production and 
distribution of atmospheric, process and other industrial gases. linde’s operations are energy intensive. energy use is mostly 
electricity for air separation, and natural gas for energy and as a feedstock for making hydrogen. where linde’s energy is sourced 
from fossil fuels, these cause direct scope 1 greenhouse gas ("ghg") emissions (principally from steam methane reforming in 
hydrogen production and from vehicle fuel use in distribution) and indirect scope 2 ghg emissions (principally from air separation). 
see “climate change” below. other environmental impacts from waste generation or air emissions are minimal and do not present 
significant business or social risks. most water is used for cooling processes and is returned to its source with little change in water 
quality.
linde’s core value of community includes a commitment to minimize linde’s environmental impact. linde’s code of business 
integrity emphasizes that care for the environment is a pre-requisite for business success. in addition to its focus on safety, linde's 
worldwide hse policy includes a focus on environmental responsibility. employees are responsible to comply with laws and to strive 
to ensure that no harm comes from their actions to the environment in which they operate. the policy reiterates that environmental 
responsibility is a core value at linde and integral in all activities. linde’s participation in responsible care® provides additional 
policy direction on environmental stewardship.
linde’s full board of directors has responsibility to review safety and environmental risk at each board meeting. the board has 
established a strategic business objective to maintain best-in-class performance in environmental responsibility. annual payout of 
executive variable compensation will partly depend on performance in this area. environmental issues are managed by the head of 
global sheq, reporting to the executive vice president of linde’s global functions. 
in addition to its global hse policy, linde is in the process of aligning the programs of the linde and praxair legacy companies 
into unified and comprehensive environmental standards and work procedures. linde’s strong worldwide environmental management 
system ensures that measures are in place to enable pollution prevention and control, the responsible management of direct and 
indirect atmospheric emissions and waste, the protection of natural resources and biodiversity and the management of environmental 
impacts from transportation or from the use and disposal of products and services. linde assesses water availability based on local 
144
sources and the latest water risk atlas of the world resource institute and focuses management effort in areas of high water use that 
are also considered areas of water stress. 
 due to the hold separate period management decisions on joint kpis for the new linde have not yet been made. these will be 
reported in linde's voluntary sustainability report in july 2019.
in 2018, linde received no substantial environmental claims for environmental violations. environmental protection costs were 
not significant, amounting to approximately $29 million of environmental expenses and $11 million of environmental investments. 
linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be proportionally similar to 2018, subject to any 
significant changes in existing laws and regulations. based on historical results and current estimates, management does not believe 
that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of 
operations or cash flows in any given year. however, worldwide costs relating to environmental protection may continue to grow due 
to increasingly stringent laws and regulations, and linde's ongoing commitment to rigorous internal standards. in addition, linde may 
face physical risks from climate change and extreme weather.
risks and opportunities from climate change
 linde operates in jurisdictions that have, or are developing, laws and/or regulations to reduce or mitigate the perceived adverse 
effects of greenhouse gas emissions and faces a highly uncertain regulatory environment in this area. for example, the u.s. 
environmental protection agency ("epa") has promulgated rules requiring reporting of ghg emissions, and linde and many of its 
suppliers and customers are subject to these rules. epa has also promulgated regulations to restrict ghg emissions, including final 
rules regulating ghg emissions from light-duty vehicles and certain large manufacturing facilities, many of which are linde suppliers 
or customers. in addition to these developments in the united states, ghgs are regulated in the european union under the emissions 
trading system, which has wide implications for the company's customers and may impact certain operations of linde in europe. 
there are also requirements for mandatory reporting in canada, which apply to certain linde operations and will be used in 
developing cap-and-trade regulations on ghg emissions. these regulations are expected to impact certain linde facilities in canada. 
climate change and energy efficiency laws and policies are also being widely introduced in jurisdictions throughout south america, 
mexico and parts of asia. china has announced plans to launch a national carbon emissions trading system, though it does not appear 
the regulations will have a direct impact on ghg emissions from linde facilities. among other impacts, such regulations are expected 
to raise the costs of energy, which is a significant cost for linde. nevertheless, linde's long-term customer contracts routinely provide 
rights to recover increased electricity, natural gas, and other costs that are incurred by the company as a result of climate change 
regulation.
linde anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business, as hydrogen is essential to refineries that use it to remove sulfur 
from transportation fuels in order to meet ambient air quality standards in the united states and fuel standards in other regions. 
hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricity-generating plants are regulated in california 
and the european union as a source of carbon dioxide emissions, and these plants are subject to cap-and-trade regulations in those 
jurisdictions. linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts. 
however, legislation that limits ghg emissions may impact growth by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance 
costs and/or decreasing demand.
to manage business risks from current and potential ghg emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate 
change, linde actively monitors current developments, evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, and takes appropriate actions. 
among others, actions include: increasing relevant resources and training; maintaining contingency plans; obtaining advice and 
counsel from expert vendors, insurance providers and industry experts; incorporating ghg provisions in commercial agreements; and 
conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management. although there are considerable uncertainties, linde believes that 
the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts. additionally, linde does not 
anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change.
linde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize its own energy use and ghg footprint through rigorous energy efficiency, 
investment in renewable energy, and the purchase of hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible. linde maintains related 
performance improvement targets and reports progress against these targets regularly to business management and annually to linde's 
board of directors.
at the same time, linde may benefit from business opportunities arising from governmental regulation of ghg and other 
emissions; uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources; the development of renewable energy alternatives; and new 
technologies that help extract natural gas, improve air quality, increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change. 
linde continues to develop new applications that can lower emissions, including ghg emissions, in linde's processes and help 
145
customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughput. stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies 
such as china provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. increased concern about 
drought in areas such as california may create a market for carbon dioxide for desalination. renewable fuel standards in the european 
union and u.s. create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and 
hydrogen.
products that offer environmental and social advantages
     linde innovation provides a competitive advantage to its customers by continuously developing new products and 
applications, which allow them to improve their productivity, energy efficiency and environmental performance. linde’s products help 
the company’s customers to develop more sustainable processes in many ways - for example by boosting energy efficiency or 
reducing emissions. linde’s products also contribute positively to the health and wellbeing of our customers. homecare patients 
worldwide benefit from our medical gases, devices, services and therapies especially in respiratory care.
in 2018, linde spent a total of $139 million on research and development (2017: $100 million).
ethics and integrity
responsible corporate governance is a key prerequisite for linde’s business success. this means ensuring compliance with the 
law, rules and regulations and voluntary commitments. integrity is a company core value. linde strives continuously to achieve its 
goals ethically and with the highest integrity. interaction between management, employees and linde's business partners is expected to 
be transparent and respectful, consistent with our code of business integrity.
the linde board believes that a strong integrity, ethics and compliance culture is a social obligation to those impacted by the 
company, necessary for maintaining investor trust and a necessary condition for effective corporate governance. the board believes 
further that such culture must be driven by example and emphasis at the top of the organization. 
ethical values and performance are significant factors in the selection of directors, the ceo and members of the leadership 
team. the board has established financial incentives for the achievement of compliance results as a key non-financial element in 
executive variable compensation.
linde has appointed a chief compliance officer ("cco") within the department of global legal and compliance who reports to 
the general counsel, who reports to the ceo. the audit committee reviews the company’s key compliance risks and compliance 
program, including that program’s design, implementation and effectiveness, with the cco and the general counsel.
linde’s code of business integrity affirms its commitment to fairness, transparency and trust as the basis for growth and 
prosperity for employees, customers, suppliers, markets and our communities. the board is responsible for monitoring the 
implementation of the code of business integrity. its responsibilities include the periodic review of the policy and overseeing 
management’s preventative, reporting, investigation and resolution programs for implementing this policy. 
the code is posted on the company website and is communicated to employees. it provides clear instructions on expected 
behavior to conform with the code and for reporting of concerns about potential non-conformance.  subcontractors and other 
stakeholders are expected to follow this standard. 
linde follows the law and is governed by all local laws wherever it is located. in the event of a conflict between local law and 
the code of business integrity or company policy, linde will follow the stricter standard within the framework of the applicable laws.
combating corruption and bribery
 linde does not tolerate the use of kickbacks or bribery in any form. third parties acting on behalf of linde are prohibited from 
giving or accepting bribes, directly or indirectly. linde’s code of business integrity prohibits activities that are or may be seen to be 
corrupt and prohibits any form of bribery. a global compliance program designed to prevent possible policy breaches focuses on 
information, training sessions and management advice. the global compliance organization helps to identify potential compliance-
related risks and to develop measures to mitigate them. concerns are reported to the leadership and the board’s audit committee.
 linde’s commitment to anti-corruption is communicated to employees using different internal channels, including mandatory 
compliance training using face-to-face and e-learning tools. employees use the integrity hotline to report potential non-compliance 
issues. third parties can also use the integrity hotline to report potential concerns.
146
human rights
human rights are basic rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of differences such as in race, color, religion, gender, 
gender identity, national origin, sexual orientation. these include the right to life and freedom, the right to work and education and the 
right to well-being, among others. linde has an obligation to comply with the law and be responsible to protect its employees, 
business operations, the environment, the communities in which it works, its business relationships and its company reputation. 
 linde’s code of business integrity and corporate hse policy, as well as other corporate and country-level policies, make clear 
the company’s commitment and management processes to address relevant areas of potential human rights concern. these include:
•  safety and health protection; a safe work environment
•  the prevention of discrimination and harassment of employees
•  equal opportunity and equal treatment
•  merit-based decisions on recruitment, hiring, promotion and compensation
•  compliance with regulations including on working hours
•  the right to privacy
•  freedom of association and freedom of peaceful assembly, including freedom to choose whether to engage in collective 
bargaining and employees’ participation in works agreements in various countries
in addition, human rights policies from legacy linde ag and legacy praxair prohibit any form of child labor or forced labor, 
including human trafficking. these policies are provided on the legacy company websites and remain current until replaced by a 
corporate linde policy.
specifically, the linde code of business integrity makes clear linde’s commitment to human rights. linde recognizes every 
person’s innate humanity and treats everyone with dignity and respect. in supporting the protection and promotion of human rights 
worldwide, linde abides by the principles of the international bill of human rights enacted by the united nations, and does not 
condone nor engage in discrimination, harassment, violations of privacy, slavery or servitude, restrictions on free assembly or unfair 
employment practices. linde commits to adhering to these human rights principles and expect similar standards to be observed by all 
with whom we conduct business.
 suppliers and other third parties play a critical role in linde’s ability to operate and provide products and services to its 
customers. their actions and practices also reflect on linde. therefore, the company chooses suppliers carefully based on merit and a 
due diligence process. linde expects suppliers to comply with legal requirements and to act in a manner that is consistent with linde’s 
values and the principles outlined in its code of business integrity.
