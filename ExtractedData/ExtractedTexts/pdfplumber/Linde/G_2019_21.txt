Pro Forma Adjustments:
To assist with a discussion of the 2019 and 2018 results on a comparable basis, certain supplemental unaudited pro forma income statement information is provided on both a consolidated and segment basis. The pro forma information has been prepared on a basis 
consistent with Article 11, assuming the Merger and merger-related divestitures had been consummated on January 1, 2018.  In preparing this pro forma information, the historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma adjustments that are 
(i) directly attributable to the Business Combination and other transactions presented herein, such as the merger-related divestitures, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined entity’s consolidated results.  The pro forma 
information is based on management's  assumptions and is presented for illustrative purposes and does not purport to represent what the results of operations would actually have been if the Business Combination and merger-related divestitures had occurred as of the dates 
indicated or what the results would be for any future periods. Also, the pro forma information does not include the impact of any revenue, cost or other operating synergies that may result from the Business Combination or any related restructuring costs. The unaudited pro 
forma income statement has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what Linde plc's results of operation actually would have been had the Merger been completed on January 1, 2018. In addition, the unaudited pro forma income 
statement does not purport to project the future operating results of the company.
(a) To include Linde AG consolidated results for the period prior to the merger date of October 31, 2018. The adjustments reflect reclassifications to conform to Linde plc's reporting format and adjustments from IFRS to U.S. GAAP.
(b) To eliminate the results of merger-related divestitures required by regulatory authorities to secure approval for the Merger. These divestitures include the majority of Praxair's European industrial gases business (completed December 3, 2018), a significant portion of Linde 
AG's Americas industrial gases business (completed on March 1, 2019), select assets of Linde AG's South Korean industrial gases business (completed April 30, 2019), as well as certain divestitures of other Praxair and Linde AG businesses in Asia.
(c) To include preliminary purchase accounting adjustments for the period from January 1, 2018 to October 30, 2018 (prior to the Merger). This relates to (i) additional depreciation and amortization related to the increased value of of property, plant and equipment and 
increased basis of intangible assets, (ii) interest expense impacts related to the fair value of debt, (iii) the tax impacts related to the non-GAAP adjustments above, (iv) income from equity investments equity related to the fair value of equity investments, and (v) noncontrolling 
interests adjustments related to the fair value adjustments above. Purchase accounting impacts are not included in the definition of segment operating profit; therefore, no pro forma adjustment is required for segment reporting.
Non-GAAP Reconciliations:
The Non-GAAP measures above are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of the company’s financial information by providing measures which investors, financial analysts and management use to help evaluate the company’s operating performance and liquidity.  
Items which the company does not believe to be indicative of on-going business trends are excluded from these calculations so that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends on a consistent basis.  Definitions of these Non-GAAP  18
measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar GAAP measures.

LINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES
SUMMARY PRO FORMA AND ADJUSTED PRO FORMA RECONCILIATIONS
(UNAUDITED)
On October 31, 2018, Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG, combined (the "Merger", or "Business Combination") under Linde plc (the "company").  Praxair, Inc. was the accounting acquirer and as a result historical 
periods prior to the merger date solely reflect the results of Praxair, Inc.
The following adjusted pro forma amounts are Non-GAAP measures and are intended to supplement investors' understanding of the company's financial statements by providing measures which investors, 
financial analysts and management use to help evaluate the company's operating performance. Items which the company does not believe to be indicative of ongoing business trends are excluded from these 
calculations so that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends on a consistent basis. Definitions of these Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions 
used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar GAAP measures. See the "PRO FORMA INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION" and "NON GAAP MEASURES AND 
RECONCILIATIONS" in appendix for additional details relating to the adjustments.

NON-GAAP MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS
(Millions of dollars, except per share data)
(UNAUDITED)
The following Non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of the company’s financial information by providing measures which investors, financial analysts and management 
use to help evaluate the company’s operating performance and liquidity.  Items which the company does not believe to be indicative of on-going business trends are excluded from these calculations so that 
investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends on a consistent basis.  Definitions of these Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other 
companies and are not a substitute for similar GAAP measures.

QUARTER ENDED December 31, 2019 PRO FORMA INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION
(Millions of dollars, except per share data)
(UNAUDITED)
To assist with a discussion of the 2019 and 2018 results on a comparable basis, certain supplemental unaudited pro forma income statement information is provided on both a 
consolidated and segment basis. The pro forma information has been prepared on a basis consistent with Article 11, assuming the Merger and merger-related divestitures had been 
consummated on January 1, 2018.  In preparing this pro forma information, the historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma adjustments that are (i) directly 
attributable to the Business Combination and other transactions presented herein, such as the merger-related divestitures, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) expected to have a 
continuing impact on the combined entity’s consolidated results.  The pro forma information is based on management's  assumptions and is presented for illustrative purposes and does 
not purport to represent what the results of operations would actually have been if the Business Combination and merger-related divestitures had occurred as of the dates indicated or 
what the results would be for any future periods. Also, the pro forma information does not include the impact of any revenue, cost or other operating synergies that may result from the 
Business Combination or any related restructuring costs. The unaudited pro forma income statement has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative 
of what Linde plc's results of operation actually would have been had the Merger been completed on January 1, 2018. In addition, the unaudited pro forma income statement does not 
purport to project the future operating results of the company.
