LETTER FROM THE CEO
ANNUAL REPORT 2018
LETTER FROM  
THE CEO
Dear shareholders, dear colleagues, dear readers,
 
2018 was another fantastic year for us. We were able to 
accelerate growth and reached several important mile-
stones. In 2018, for the first time we processed more 
than 1.5 million orders (including Germany) in one day 
globally. Over the course of the year our GMV amounted 
to EUR 4.5bn (excluding Germany) and our segment rev-
enues to EUR 687 million. Iʼm incredibly proud that we 
were able to build the company that it is today through 
entrepreneurial drive and relentless focus on delivering 
an amazing experience for our customers. 
Yet despite those achievements, weʼre only scratching the 
surface of the global opportunity we have ahead of us. 
While awareness and consumer demand for our services 
has never been higher, many customers do not order food 
and other items to their homes yet. And of those who do 
order food, roughly 90% still call the restaurants for a add 
directly. While this is certainly true for almost all markets 
globally, it is even more so for Delivery Hero. Our global 
footprint is focussed particularly on more early stage 
markets providing room for growth for the next decades.

OUR VISION
ANNUAL REPORT 2018
OUR UPGRADED  
VISION
Our successful business performance has continued to be the result of our strong  
vision and unwavering focus on providing an amazing on-demand experience.  
We continually invest to improve our food and restaurant selection, but throughout  
2018 we also focused on expanding a more holistic ordering service.
 
As a result, 2018 saw us roll out many new features and additional products,  
driving trends we saw developing in the delivery sector. This continuous focus  
on innovation will ensure we are able to provide our customers with the most  
convenient, personalized ordering experience.
 
We are particularly proud to hold innovation at the core of our culture, as it is  
our key strength when it comes to tackling the market opportunity. 
our vision to always deliver amazing experiences, is driven by investment in three  
significant pillars: global leadership, product and technology.

INCREASED MARKET OPPORTUNITIES
ANNUAL REPORT 2018
INCREASED MARKET  
OPPORTUNITY 
Throughout 2018 we continued to see our market opportunities 
expand globally due to the fact that many countries we operate  
in still have low online penetration – a figure which has not changed 
from the low teen levels we outlined at time of IPO – with the  
majority of orders still being placed via the telephone. 
Being at the forefront of the ongoing channel-shift puts us at a strong 
competitive advantage, with a much longer growth runway than 
other food delivery peers. 
We have also seen the overall market opportunity expand due to:
1. An increased demand for convenience
2. A  n increased number of restaurants and cuisines available  
on our platform
3. I mproved food quality and lower prices, driven by more  
efficient restaurant operations and so called “shared  
kitchens” and “virtual kitchens”

GLOBAL 
LEADERSHIP
Delivery Hero is a global leader in online food delivery,  
with a larger reach and greater scale than competitors  
in all markets of operation. Outside of South Korea, Norway 
and Canada, we now fulfill three times as many orders than  
all our competitors combined in our markets of operation.  
In 2018, we are the #1 leader in 33 of our 41 countries  
with approximately 80% of GMV comingfrom these  
leadership countries.
12
GLOONBA AL  LMEAISDSEIORSNH IP
ANNUAL REPORT 2018
290,000
LISTED RESTAURANTS
Per Q4 2018 we processed on average more than 36 million orders per  
month – more than 3 times as much as our competitorsʼ orders combined  
(including Takeaway.com, UberEats, Deliveroo, Grab, Just Eat, Zomato and  
additional local competitors) in our countries of operation outside of  
South Korea, Norway and Canada. 
In 2018 we substantially expanded our restaurant selection, closing the year  
with more than 290,000 active restaurants listed across our platforms globally  
and we operate in more than 4,000 cities.  
 
We were able to reach this figure thanks to building our clear leadership in  
own-delivery, enabling us to partner with restaurants without their own fleets.  
Per Q4 2018, our delivery riders delivered more than 7 million orders per month  
in over 200 cities. Outside of South Korea, Norway and Canada, we now fulfill  
twice as much own delivery orders than all our competitors combined in our  
markets of operation1.
By taking this hybrid approach (combining both marketplace and our own logistical 
capabilities) we continued to develop highly efficient operations, enabling us to 
reduce delivery costs. We now have a similar profit contribution per order when  
we provide first-party delivery or third-party delivery, once our operations are up  
to scale. 
As we continue to improve efficiencies further we will pass saving down to our  
customers to drive additional frequency and adoption.

IMPROVED PRODUCT  
AND TECHNOLOGY
 
ADDING HIGH FREQUENCY PRODUCTS
One of our major focuses in 2018 was the expansion  
of our product offering and securing our status as a  
third generation delivery company. Developments in  
proprietary technology and executional capabilities  
allowed us to expand into new verticals such a groceries, 
pharmacies and flowers and other convenience articles  
in multiple markets. Throughout 2018 we rolled out  
multi-vertical delivery platforms in 9 countries. 
ADDING VIRTUAL KITCHENS
Although still in the early days, 2018 saw us gain  
good traction in the concept and shared kitchen  
space, which we rolled out in selected cities globally.  
By offering specifically for delivery prepared, good  
quality food in better quality packaging, these  
concepts allow us to lever our operational expertise  
and achieve more efficient cost structures, which benefit  
customers, restaurants and us as intermediaries.

INNOVATION FOR THE RESTAURANT
We aim to provide our partners with the most innovative  
technology available (Restaurant Partner Solution – RPS)  
to enable them to reach their full potential for our mutual  
advantage. We increase their order volumes, give them  
access to new customers, improve their efficiency, and add  
revenue at improved margins. Moreover, restaurants benefit  
from the data which Delivery Hero is aggregating, allowing  
them to take better decisions on customer offerings, pricing, 
location and menu items. 
Included in our RPS is our point-of-sale technology. This  
allows restaurants to enter in their walk-in orders and helps  
them to better understand their business and drive further  
efficiencies in the restaurant. 
Throughout 2018 we improved our RPS integration, which  
is now live globally. As we continue to improve RPS coverage,  
the technology will give us more holistic exposure to data, 
which, in turn, will enable us to drive further efficiencies and 
improve both our partnersʼ and customersʼ experience.
CONTINUOUS INNOVATION
We are driving industry change, and continually iterating  
our technology. In 2018 we developed voice ordering,  
which has been integrated into virtual assistants, corporate 
 platforms and our chat applications to further improve  
customer experience. In 2018, we further focussed on 
 personalization features, which are now deployed in  
23 countries.

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
The financial year 2018 was a significant and successful 
year for Delivery Hero SE (the “Company”), and one in 
which the Company reached several impressive milestones. 
Thanks to consistent strong growth, the Delivery Hero 
Group has developed an outstanding, global market posi-
tion, with the Group now taking over 100 million orders 
per quarter. Noteworthy, in particular, are the successful 
conversion of the Companyʼs form to a European joint stock 
corporation (societas Europaea, SE), being admitted the 
MDAX for the Deutsche Börseʼs Prime Standard, the first 
annual general meeting and the sale of operations in 
Germany.
