LETTER FROM THE CEO

LETTER FROM  
THE CEO
Fellow Shareholders and Heroes,
 
We had an incredible last year! Our business grew orders 
by more than 80% to 666 million, processed € 7.4 billion 
of GMV and generated € 1,456 million in revenue. Our 
growth accelerated throughout the year and our market 
share increased in every region compared to every 
competitor in the markets we operate. More importantly, 
we made enormous improvements in technology and 
talent development. The success of 2019 is the result of 
years of focus into customer experience and company 
culture. When we started back in 2011, we were a pure 
marketplace business but moved into logistics already in 
2014; in 2018 we entered new verticals and most recently 
kitchens and instant delivery of groceries from our central 
warehouses. All this ties back to our vision of delivering 
an amazing experience – fast and easy to the door.

LISTED RESTAURANTS
By operating a hybrid delivery platform – meaning operating as a marketplace as 
well as having own-delivery capabilities – Delivery Hero ensures the best quantity, 
quality and choice to the consumer. As of January 2020, we achieved the important 
milestone of 500,000 active restaurants listed across our platforms. This makes 
Delivery Hero the global leader in online food delivery, with the biggest restaurant 
network globally outside of China. 
The vast number of restaurants offer our customers an amazing array of cuisine 
types to satisfy their tastes. Moreover, providing delivery services increases the 
number of potential customers served by high-demand restaurants, allowing us to 
rollout delivery in neighborhoods with higher order density. With only approx. 
4.6% of orders generated by any single brand, we continue to provide a diversified 
portfolio of restaurants. 
Numerous cloud restaurants operating globally and the continued rollout of virtual 
restaurants provides better quality food with reduced delivery times at lower costs. 
By offering quality food in better packaging, specifically designed for delivery, these 
concepts allow us to lever our operational expertise and achieve more efficient cost 
structures. A good initial traction has been noted given the benefits brought to 
customers and restaurants. This has led Delivery Hero to further invest into virtual 
restaurants in the fourth quarter of 2019.

RELIABLE DELIVERY 
SERVICES 
We strive to provide a fast and more reliable service to our customers with real- 
time updates. Therefore, Delivery Hero tightly manages all steps in the food delivery 
life cycle, including transmission, delivery and post-order services. We are deeply 
integrated with the operations of our restaurant partners, which allows us to learn  
the cooking times of their dishes and make sure the food is ready exactly at the  
time the delivery rider arrives at the restaurant, all to improve speed, reliability and 
food quality. 
We work to improve the delivery experience for our customers by providing vendors 
with our restaurant partner solution, built on proprietary technology. The innovative 
solution allows for better management of the delivery process for restaurants while 
improving efficiency of our own delivery operations. Furthermore, we ensure full 
transparency to our customers by providing live tracking or constant status updates, 
which has been further improved in accuracy in 2019.

AVERAGE DELIVERY TIME
IN Q4 2019
As per Q4 2019 45% of orders were delivered via our proprietary techno-
logy solution “Hurrier”, reaching an important milestone of 1 million 
delivery orders per day. With improved logistic efficiencies we decreased 
delivery time to below 28 minutes in Q4 2019, with even faster execution 
in dense areas. Improved unit economics, that in some markets (i.e.,  
KSA) are even exceeding those of marketplace orders, is the result of 
significant investment as well as numerous years building and refining 
our delivery technology and restaurant operations. We clearly expect to 
see improving unit economics in a range of markets throughout 2020.

We are passionate about taking our  customers’ ordering experience to the next level. 
Each day we focus on simplifying and personalizing our product, so that we can

wants, when they want it. Our data-driven approach has led to 22 billion data points 
being processed in December 2019.
In 2019 we continued to focus on key product improvements. This included inspiring 
customers with a simple ordering process, more visualization during the discovery 
 process by adding  delicious food images, the ability to search at dish level, increasingly 
personalized restaurant recommendations, a wide variety of payment options and a 
convenient reorder facility. Subtle feature improvements that resulted in increased

proprietary technology and executional capabilities allowed us to expand into   
multi-vertical offerings in multiple markets, this includes products from groceries, 
pharmacies, flower stores and other convenience articles. Throughout 2019 we rolled 
out multi-vertical delivery platforms in 29 countries. During 2019, multi-verticals 
surpassed the threshold of 1m orders per month. Given the good initial traction, 
Delivery Hero has invested into the expansion of Dmart1 across MENA and Asia.  
By the end of 2019, 51 Dmart were present in Turkey, Kuwait, KSA, UAE and Qatar  
and the first Dmart had launched in Singapore and Taiwan. The advanced rollout
