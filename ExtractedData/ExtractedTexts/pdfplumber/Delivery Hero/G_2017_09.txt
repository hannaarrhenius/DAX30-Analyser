LETTER FROM THE CEO  Annual Report 2017
MY  
MOTIVATION
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS, COLLEAGUES, AND READERS
SERVING  
2017 was an incredible year for us. We served 292 million orders and extended our global market leadership, 
while achieving revenue growth of 60%. These numbers are the result of many milestones, big and small.  292 MILLION  
Below are some that stand out in particular. 
ORDERS
During the first months of last year we integrated foodpanda into the Delivery Hero Group. Their team and   
business assets are a great addition to the Group, strengthening our position in Asia and Middle East. 
We welcomed Carriage – a Kuwait-based, own-delivery focused company – to our business. Their team has 
 surpassed even our high expectations and again proves our strength of supporting local founders and 
management teams to further build out our leadership, in this case across the MENA region. 
5
Besides these organizational changes, we were happy to gain Naspers as a long-term shareholder and
Supervisory Board member, who shares our ambitious vision of food ordering.
We built on this in June with the initial public offering of Delivery Hero shares on the Frankfurt stock exchange, 
marking a milestone in our development process from start-up to world-leading organization. I am truly proud 
of what the team at Delivery Hero has built and am happy to see that many new shareholders have committed 
to our vision – leading to a strong trading start. For me personally, the IPO was more of a starting point than a 
goal achieved. We are now in a strong economic position to continue pursuing our vision of creating amazing 
takeaway experiences to give joyful moments for our customers.
The strong focus on our customers’ experiences should of course also be reflected in our financial and 
 operational results. We are proud to have: 
— increased revenues by 60%,
— increased orders by 48% and gross merchandise volume (GMV) by 46%,
— improved our adjusted EBITDA margin from –34% (2016) to –17% (2017) on a like-for-like basis.
As rewarding as looking back to our achievements from 2017, at Delivery Hero our minds are focused  
on the future. As this is my first letter to shareholders, the below outlines how I envision Delivery Hero to  
develop over the coming years and some of the principles by which we operate, in order to allow you to better 
understand the company.
LETTER FROM THE CEO  Annual Report 2017
As the market for food ordering is maturing, shifting online and improving in service quality, there is still  
enormous potential for growth. Even in the more mature markets we operate, the combination of online shift 
SIGNIFICANT  
and increased user frequency is going to continue drive our growth for many, many years to come. I see it as 
paramount that we continue to invest in shaping this development and create the best possible experience for  GROWTH  
our customers. The main criteria by which we e valuate our success is our continued order and GMV growth, 
increasing customer satisfaction, and being the preferred platform for food ordering – all of these are key  OPPORTUNITY  
 indicators we constantly obsess about as a company and management team. 
FOR MANY  
To achieve the above we continue to focus on four main pillars:  YEARS TO COME
Our organization: As the company grows, the responsibility to take good decisions rests on more and more 
people. It is of great importance for me that Delivery Hero is able to attract and retain the best people who  
6 can stand up to this challenge. One important aspect of Delivery Hero are the many founders of our b usinesses 
across the world who have joined our Group and are excited to  continue shaping it. We have built an 
 environment where we foster this ownership mentality of local management teams while investing in building 
excellent central support structures to get the best of both worlds: world-class people close to our customers/
markets and world-class technology and services provided to them by our central team.
On top of that, we are aware that there is more to our organization than business. We strongly believe that  
a company’s real test is whether it creates long-term value for all its stakeholders. Only then will it be able  
to generate sustainable profits for its shareholders. We must therefore apply the highest standards when 
making decisions and I look forward to presenting a more formalized approach to our corporate responsi- 
bility as Delivery Hero continues to grow. 
Our customers: The one thing we cannot forget as a company is to make sure that we stay close to our custo­
mers and markets. We have to care about every order, we should never leave a hungry customer unhappy.   
This is why one of the most important metrics to look at for me is our net promoter score (NPS), a measure of 
the share of customers who would recommend our service. Besides fulfilling these known expectations, we 
need to make sure we stay one step ahead. We need to experiment and make use of technology to create an 
ever-better service in ways neither our customers nor we anticipate today. 
Therefore, it is vital that we keep innovating even as the company matures. This requires us to make small bets 
occasionally and separate them from our daily operations. Once we prove the economic validity of such bets,  
we will double down on them and invest in order to build a leading business. One such example from the past 
LETTER FROM THE CEO  Annual Report 2017
is the development of our own-delivery capabilities. We developed this as a separate business unit  
in a few of our markets and are now rolling out the technologies and processes in almost every market  
I’M CONFIDENT  
in order to be the provider with the leading restaurant selection everywhere.
THAT 2018  
Our restaurant partners: Delivery Hero would be nothing without our partners who actually prepare 
the food for our customers. We will continue to invest in making their lives easier and providing   WILL BE A  
them with even more new business opportunities by partnering with us. Besides working more closely 
SUCCESSFUL  
with our existing partners, we also believe there are many thousands of potential new partners out 
there and we aim to connect them with our fast-growing customer base. We will invest in reaching out  YEAR
to new restaurants and building the strongest restaurant networks in all markets we operate in. 
Continuous fast growth: We believe that we need to build market-leading brands in order to be in a 
position to invest and create the best customer experiences. This requires continuous focus on all of   7
the minute details of our operations. As a former professional cross-country skier I’m used to training 
every day and to working hard to make incremental improvements in what I do – part of my job is  
to instill this spirit throughout the entire company. 
Of course, continuous fast growth also requires continued investment. I firmly believe that a significant 
share of excess profit contributions need to be re-invested at this stage of the company’s development  
in order to create and maintain a market leadership position for sustainable and long term profits.  
The investment opportunities range from better services, better restaurant integration and coverage  
to higher customer acquisition budgets. This is in line with our commitment to be full year adjusted 
EBITDA profitable in 2019.
I’m confident that if we focus on the above, 2018 will be another successful year. Thank you for your 
trust in our heroic team – we will continue to work hard to deliver on our vision and shape the trends  
of our industry. I’m excited about the future and what we will be able to achieve together.
Yours sincerely,
NIKLAS ÖSTBERG
