notes to consolidated financial statements
a.  general  disclosures  concerning  the  consolidated  financial 
statements 
1.  group profile 
delivery hero holding gmbh (hereinafter also referred to as: 'dhh') is a company with international 
operations; together with its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively: the 'dh group') it provides online 
food ordering services in 30 countries on four continents (europe, south america, asia and australia).  
the company has its registered office at mohrenstrasse 60, 10117 berlin, and is entered in the 
commercial register of the berlin local court under hrb 135090. the company is a limited liability 
company in accordance with german law. 
management prepared the consolidated financial statements as of august 21, 2015, and submitted 
these directly to the shareholders. 
2.  accounting principles of the consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to ifrs 
the consolidated financial statements of the dh group have been prepared in accordance with the 
international  financial  reporting  standards  (ifrs)  adopted  and  issued  by  the  international 
accounting  standards  board  (iasb),  as  adopted  by  the  european  union.  preparation  of  the 
consolidated financial statements occurred under application of the provisions of regulation (ec) no 
1606/2002 of the european parliament and of the council of july 19, 2002, on the application of 
international accounting standards in conjunction with section 315a (3) of the german commercial 
code [hgb] taking into consideration the supplementary provisions of german commercial law. 
the consolidated financial statements comply with the classification regulations stipulated in ias 1. 
the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income has been prepared in 
accordance with the cost-of-sales method. there is a distinction between current and non-current 
assets and liabilities in the presentation of the consolidated statement of financial position. assets or 
liabilities falling due within one year are classified as current. individual items in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the statement of financial position are 
summarized to improve the clarity of the presentation. these items are explained in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements.  
the consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, unless otherwise stated, all figures have 
been rounded to the nearest eur thousand (keur). for computational reasons, there may be 
rounding differences to the exact mathematical values in tables and references.  
the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of the going concern principle which 
assumes that the group is able to meet the obligatory terms of redemption of loan liabilities, as 
specified in the disclosures to the notes e.14 (refer also to d.13a). the dh group generated a 
consolidated loss of keur -88,906 in the 2014 financial year (2013: keur -36,150). owing to the 
procurement of debt capital and equity, the previous loss arising from operating activities will be offset 
again in the 2015 financial year. as of the reporting date, capital resources could be raised to a 
considerable extent from third parties (refer also to chapter h.13). as a consequence, management 
realistically expects that the group will have adequate resources to continue business activities for the 
foreseeable  period.  assets  and  liabilities  are  therefore  principally  measured  at  amortized  cost. 
1 
 
excluded from this are financial assets and liabilities that are carried at the fair value applicable on the 
reporting date. these are listed under notes d.7 and d.8b. 
the consolidated financial statements and group management report are published in the german 
federal gazette [bundesanzeiger]. 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with ifrss requires management 
estimates  and  measurements.  areas  involving  a  higher  degree  of  judgment  or  areas  where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in 
note d.13.

these consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the first time on the basis of ifrs. 
for this reason, the standards and interpretations valid as of december 31, 2014, in accordance with 
ifrs 1, have been taken as the basis from the date of transition to ifrs as of january 1, 2013. the 
dh group did not adopt any ifrss early.  
the  standards  issued  by  the  iasb  but  not  yet  subject  to  mandatory  adoption  (ifrss)  and 
interpretations (ifric) are presented and their future impact on the accounting of the dh group are 
commented upon below. in addition, these are summarized in the above table. 
ifric 21 levies, issued in may 2013, specifies the time at which an entity has to recognize an 
obligation to pay a public levy as a liability. first-time adoption takes effect for the reporting period 
from january 1, 2015. we assume this will have no material effect on the consolidated financial 
statements of the dh group. 
the iasb issued an amendment to ias 19 employee benefits: employee contributions to defined 
benefit plans in november 2013. this change has now clarified the procedure for recognizing the 
contributions of employees or third parties included in the terms and conditions of a defined benefit 
plan if these are linked to the employees' period of service. this change will have no impact on the dh 
group. the change applies to the reporting period from january 1, 2016. 
the iasb issued "improvements to ifrss 2010-2012" in december 2013. they constitute the fifth 
collective standard for various amendments to six existing ifrss. the amendments are to be adopted 
for financial years commencing after january 1, 2016. this will have no impact on the dh group. 
the iasb issued "improvements to ifrss 2011-2013" in december 2013. they constitute the sixth 
collective standard for various amendments to four existing ifrss. the amendments are to be 
adopted for financial years commencing after january 1, 2015. we assume this will have no material 
effect for the dh group. 
the  iasb  issued  "improvements  to  ifrss  2012-2014"  in  september  2014.  they  constitute  the 
seventh  collective  standard  for  various  amendments  to  four  existing  ifrss.  subject  to  the  eu 
comitology procedure, the amendments are provisionally applicable for financial years starting after 
january 1, 2016. we assume this will have no material effect for the dh group. 
the  iasb  issued  amendments  to  ifrs 11  joint  arrangements  in  may  2014.  this  clarifies  that 
purchases and additional purchases of shares in joint arrangements, which constitute operations 
within the meaning of ifrs 3 business combinations, are to be shown according to the ifrs 3 
principles for the accounting of business combinations and other applicable ifrss provided these do 
not conflict with the requirements of ifrs 1. subject to the eu comitology procedure, the amendments 
are provisionally applicable for financial years starting on january 1, 2016. we assume this will have 
no material effect for the dh group. 
the iasb issued ifrs 14 regulatory deferral accounts in january 2014. due to the regulations of the 
standard, companies preparing ifrs financial statements for the first time in accordance with ifrs 1 
first-time adoption of international financial reporting standards are allowed to maintain regulatory 
deferral accounts (which they had recognized linked to price-regulated activities under their previous 
national  accounting  rules)  in  the  ifrs  financial  statements  and  continue  to  recognize  these  in 
accordance  with  previous  accounting  policies.    subject  to  the  eu  comitology  procedure,  the 
amendments are to be applied for the financial year starting on january 1, 2016, and have no 
relevance for the dh group. 
the iasb issued amendments to ias 16 property, plant and equipment and ias 38 intangible assets 
in may 2014. the aim of these amendments is to clarify which methods are appropriate for the 
depreciation of property, plant and equipment and the amortization of intangible assets. subject to the 
eu comitology procedure, the amendments are provisionally applicable for financial years starting on 
january 1, 2016. we assume this will have no material effect for the dh group. 
4 
 
the iasb issued ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers in may 2014. ifrs 15 replaced 
the previous ifrs requirements for revenue recognition (inter alia ias 18 and ias 11). the aim of the 
new standard for revenue recognition is to bring together the various regulations contained previously 
in different standards and interpretations into one uniform model for revenue recognition. the standard 
provides for a five-step model through which the amount of revenue and the date of recognition are to 
be determined. further amendments can arise due to revisions for revenue recognition in the case of 
transfer of control, multi-component transactions, revenue recognition over the period of service 
performance as well as due to extended disclosures in the notes. subject to eu endorsement, the 
standard is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after january 1, 2018. the dh group is 
examining the impact of the standard. 
the  iasb  concluded  its  project  to  replace  ias 39  financial  instruments:  recognition  and 
measurement in july 2014 through the issue of the final version of ifrs 9 financial instruments. 
ifrs 9 includes the revised requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets as 
well as a new risk provisioning model that also takes account of expected losses in the calculation of 
risk provisioning. in addition, the new rules for hedge accounting, issued in november 2013, were 
adopted. the standard replaces all earlier versions of ifrs 9 and is, subject to eu endorsement, to be 
adopted for the first time in the reporting period beginning on or after january 1, 2018. the dh group 
is examining the impact of the standard. 
the iasb published amendments to ifrs 10/ias 28 sale or contribution of assets between an 
investor and its associate or joint venture in september 2014. the amendments address a conflict 
between the requirements of ias 28 investments in associates and joint ventures and ifrs 10 
consolidated financial statements. these clarify that in a transaction involving an associate or a joint 
venture, the extent of the gain or loss recognition depends on whether the assets sold or contributed 
constitute a business. the date of first-time adoption (iasb) is january 1, 2016. we assume this will 
have no effect for the dh group. 
the iasb published amendments to ifrs 10, ifrs 12 and ias 28 investment entities: applying the 
consolidation exception in december 2014. the amendments address issues that have arisen in 
relation to the application of the exemption from consolidation for investment entities. subject to the 
eu comitology procedure, the amendments are provisionally applicable for financial years starting on 
january 1, 2016. we assume this will have no effect for the dh group. 
the iasb issued amendments to ias 1 disclosure initiative in december 2014. this intends to 
encourage companies to exercise judgment on the information they disclose. the aim is, inter alia, to 
relieve ifrs financial statements of immaterial information as well as to promote the communication 
of relevant information. subject to the eu comitology procedure, the amendments are provisionally 
applicable for financial years starting on january 1, 2016. this will have an impact on disclosure in the 
notes of the dh group.

b.  first-time adoption of ifrs 
1.  application of ifrs 1 
the  dh  group  has  taken  the  ifrs 1  first-time  adoption  of  international  financial  reporting 
standards as the basis for these first ifrs consolidated financial statements. the opening ifrs 
statement of financial position was prepared at the date of transition to the ifrss on january 1, 2013. 
the standards and interpretations, valid as of december 31, 2014, were applied for the recognition 
and  measurement  of  assets  and  liabilities  as  of  january 1,  2013,  in  accordance  with  ifrs 1. 
differences resulting from the application of accounting policies prior to the date of transition to ifrs 
are directly recognized in revenue reserves and other reserves. 
2.  exceptions, optional exemptions and exemptions for the first-
time adoption of ifrs 
the  dh  group  makes  use  of  the  exceptions  and  exemptions  of  ifrs 1.18  in  conjunction  with 
ifrs 1.c1. ifrs 3 was not applied retrospectively to past business combinations. 
3.  transition from hgb to ifrs 
a)  transition of total consolidated comprehensive income 
 
the dh group voluntarily prepared hgb consolidated financial statements for the first time for the 
2012 financial year. the effects of the transition to ifrs as of january 1, 2013, and december 31, 
2013, on group equity and the 2013 consolidated statement of comprehensive income are presented 
below:

the material differences between the accounting policies mainly result from the differences between 
hgb and ifrs accounting standards, described below. 
(cid:129)  loans granted to the dh group for funding purposes must be measured at fair value in 
accordance with ias 39.43. fair value corresponds to future discounted payment obligations 
taking into account transaction costs and discounts. loans are subsequently measured at 
amortized cost. 
(cid:129)  differences between ifrs and hgb measurements of assets and liabilities result in the 
recognition of deferred taxation. furthermore, the recognition option for deferred tax assets 
pursuant to section 274 (1) hgb is not applicable. 
(cid:129)  provisions must be recognized pursuant to ias 37 if there is a present obligation of the entity 
arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the 
entity of resources embodying economic benefits. furthermore, a reliable estimate of the 
amount of the obligation must be possible. the amount recognized as a provision should be 
the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting 
date. in contrast to this, provisions measured pursuant to hgb are valued according to 
prudent  commercial  judgment.  ias 37  attaches  special  conditions  to  the  calculation  of 
restructuring provisions. finally, effects arise from the application of different discount rates in 
accordance with hgb and ifrs. 
(cid:129)  derivatives are recognized as a liability or asset pursuant to ias 39 and measured at fair 
value. however, under hgb, only a provision for anticipated losses on pending transactions is 
recognized, provided no valuation unit was formed. 
(cid:129)  intangible assets are recognized pursuant to ias 38. pursuant to ias 38, goodwill is not 
amortized proportionally but solely in the case of a determined impairment. 
an error correction for goodwill was made in the current financial statements in 2013 to rectify 
an accounting error arising from the previous accounting standard. this value was then 
adopted pursuant to ifrs 1.c1 in the ifrs opening statement of financial position. 
7 
 
(cid:129)  measurement and presentation of share-based payment programs are governed by ifrs 2. in 
accordance with ifrs 2, costs arising from granting equity instruments to employees are 
measured at the fair value of these instruments at the date granted.

differences between ifrs and hgb mainly arise from the following items: 
a)  separate recognition of interest paid in the statement of cash flows from financing activities 
pursuant to ias 7. 
b)  changes in the scope of consolidation arising from investing activities are presented in the 
statement of cash flows along with recognition of interest received. 
c)  separate recognition of interest paid in the statement of cash flows from financing activities 
pursuant to ias 7. 
d)  different assignment to cash and cash equivalents in the course of ifrs restatements. 
e)  changes in the scope of consolidation arising from investing activities are presented in the 
statement of cash flows. 
c.  scope of consolidation and consolidation methods 
the dhh financial statements and those of subsidiaries in and outside of germany are prepared 
according to uniform accounting policies. in the process, the principles are consistently applied for all 
presented periods and reporting dates in the consolidated financial statements. 
1.  methods of consolidation 
a)  subsidiaries 
 
 
dhh and all subsidiaries over which dhh has the possibility of direct or indirect control are fully 
consolidated in the consolidated financial statements of the dh group. first-time consolidation occurs 
at the date of obtaining the possibility of control. dhh controls a participating undertaking when it is 
exposed to variable returns from its involvement and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power of control. if dhh loses the possibility of control, the relevant participating undertaking is 
deconsolidated. 
8 
 
acquirers are recognized by applying the acquisition method. in applying the acquisition method, the 
cost of the acquired shares is offset against the proportionate fair value of the acquired assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at the acquisition date. a positive difference arising 
from  offsetting  is  capitalized  as  derived  goodwill.  negative  differences  that  result  from  capital 
consolidation at the date of acquisition are immediately reclassified from equity to profit or loss. 
non-controlling interests constitute the share of profit or loss and net assets that are not attributed to 
the parent's shareholders and are recognized separately. they are measured at the acquisition date 
using the proportionate share of the acquirer's net identifiable assets. changes in the group's interest 
in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as an equity transaction.  
concerning  written  put  options  agreed  in  the  course  of  acquisitions  regarding  remaining  non-
controlling interests, the company makes uses of its accounting policy choice and recognizes these in 
accordance with ifrs 3.40 as a contingent consideration. thus non-controlling interests are no longer 
recognized in the financial statements. 
when  the  group  loses control of  a  subsidiary,  it  derecognizes  the  assets and  liabilities  of  the 
subsidiary and all related non-controlling interests and other equity components. any gain or loss is 
recognized in profit or loss. any retained interest in the former subsidiary is recognized at fair value on 
the date when control was lost. 
expenses  and  income,  as  well  as  receivables  and  payables between  consolidated  entities,  are 
eliminated along with intragroup profits/losses arising from intragroup transactions. 
in the case of one participation qualifying as a subsidiary, inclusion in the consolidated financial 
statements is waived due to the subordinate importance and materiality as well as the negative cost-
benefit ratio. 
b)  associates and joint ventures 
 
associates are companies over which dhh has a significant influence; this usually assumes a holding 
of between 20% to 50% of voting rights. joint ventures are joint arrangements for which dhh jointly 
shares rights to the net assets of the arrangement with other companies. from the perspective of 
dhh, no associated companies or joint ventures existed as of the reporting date. 
the list of shareholdings in section h.10 contains an overview of all dhh investments.

2.  changes in the group 
in the reporting year, the number of entities to be fully consolidated changed as follows: 
number of fully consolidated companies 2014 2013
jan. 1          24             25
additions            24           - 
disposals due to sale              1              1 
disposals due to merger              7           - 
dec. 31          40             24
 
seven companies were merged into other subsidiaries in 2014; a further subsidiary was already sold 
outside of the group in 2013. in addition, ten subsidiaries were not consolidated for reasons of 
materiality in 2013; due to disposals, mergers and liquidations, this number declined to one entity in 
2014. 
in the 2014 financial year, material purchases were made as part of acquisitions, which are presented 
in detail in the section below in accordance with the requirements of ifrs 3.  
 
3.  acquisitions 
the dh group was able to realize a large number of acquisitions in 2014. the cash component of the 
purchase price of all acquisitions amounts to keur 298,821. assumed cash and cash equivalents 
amount in total to keur 6,954. individual acquisitions are dealt with below. 
a)  9cookies 
 
with  legally  binding  effect  from  january 1,  2014,  the  acquisition  of  9cookies gmbh,  berlin 
('9cookies'), realized a strategic investment intending to gain greater access to restaurant customers 
in germany;  9cookies develops mobile cash register systems. the acquisition cost for 100% of the 
shares amounted to keur 1,043, which was paid in the reporting period.  
the acquisition costs of this business combination were allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities 
using the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date as follows: 
in keur  fair value after acquisition
intangible assets  1,228
property, plant and equipment  23
trade receivables  47
other assets  58
cash and cash equivalents  53
provisions and liabilities  -1,885
trade payables  -135
deferred tax liabilities  -313
net assets  -924
consideration  1,043
goodwill  1,967
 
 
10 
 
above all, goodwill is not attributed to separately identifiable assets such as the positive future 
business outlook, employee expertise and the expected synergy effects arising from integration. 
acquired intangible assets are not subject to an indefinite useful life. the gross amount of acquired 
trade receivables amounted to keur 47, for which no impairment was recognized. transaction costs 
for the acquisition of 9cookies recognized under other operating expenses for the financial year 
amounted to keur 58. 
since  first-time  inclusion  as  of  january 1,  2014,  9cookies  has  contributed  keur 131  to  group 
revenue and keur -3,368 to consolidated profit/loss. 
b)  pedidosya 
 
on  february 1,  2014,  a  strategic  investment  in  south  america  was  made  in  order  to  obtain 
comprehensive access to customers in different countries in south and central america. in the course 
of this, the company acquired 84.5% of shares in pedidosya s.a. (formerly kinboy international s.a.), 
uruguay (pedidosya). pedidosya operates restaurant portals for processing online food orders in 
different countries in south and central america.  
the  fair  value  determined  for  the  consideration  amounted  to  keur 17,036  and  comprises  the 
purchase  price  paid  in  the  reporting  period  of  keur 11,891,  a  contingent  consideration  of 
keur 1,418 and a contingent purchase price liability of keur 3,727, recognized as of the acquisition 
date for the option rights to acquire the remaining 15.5% of shares. the put options for shares of non-
controlling  interests,  adopting  an  economic  approach,  are  treated  as  contingent  considerations 
(synthetic forward transaction). as a consequence, financial liabilities represent a portion of the 
transferred consideration for all shares. none of the shares of non-controlling interests that are 
equipped with a put option are recognized in group equity. fair value changes for financial liabilities 
are recognized in profit or loss commensurate with rules for contingent considerations in subsequent 
measurement. the net valuation result from put/call options is recognized in finance income/costs.  
the allocation of acquisition costs for this business combination to acquired assets and liabilities using 
the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date is as follows: 
 
fair value after acquisition
in keur  
intangible assets   10,175
property, plant and equipment  29
trade receivables  110
other assets  1,091
cash and cash equivalents  2,089
provisions and liabilities  -1,465
trade payables  -9
deferred tax liabilities  -2,842
net assets  9,178
cost  17,036
goodwill  7,858
 
above all, goodwill is not attributed to separately identifiable assets such as the positive future 
business outlook, employee expertise and the expected synergy effects arising from integration. 
acquired intangible assets are not subject to an indefinite useful life. the gross amount of acquired 
trade  receivables  amounted  to  keur 110  and  corresponded  to  the  fair  value.  other  operating 
expenses  for  the  financial  year  recognized  transaction  costs  of  keur 8  for  the  acquisition  of 
pedidosya; additional transaction costs are anticipated in the course of negotiations for the call option 
previously recognized in 2013. 
11 
 
since first-time inclusion as of february 1, 2014, pedidosya has contributed keur 2,279 to group 
revenue and keur -8,512 to consolidated profit/loss. had pedidosya already been fully consolidated 
on january 1, 2014, pedidosya would have contributed keur 2,423 to group revenue and keur -
8,832 to consolidated profit/loss. 
c)  clickdelivery 
 
in order to strengthen presence in south america, a strategic investment in restaurant portals for 
processing online food orders in different countries in south america was made and 67.8% of the 
shares in inversiones cmr s.a.s., colombia ('clickdelivery') were acquired. the provisional fair value 
determined for the consideration amounted to keur 14,596 and comprises the purchase price paid in 
the  reporting  period  of  keur 6,867  and  a  contingent  purchase  price  liability  of  keur 7,729 
recognized as of the acquisition date for the option rights to acquire the remaining 32.2% of shares. 
the put option for shares of non-controlling interests, adopting an economic approach, are treated as 
contingent considerations. as a consequence, financial liabilities represent a portion of the transferred 
consideration for all shares. none of the shares of non-controlling interests that are equipped with a 
put option are recognized in group equity. fair value changes for financial liabilities are recognized in 
profit or loss commensurate with rules for contingent considerations in subsequent measurement. the 
net valuation result from put/call options is recognized in finance income/costs. 
on account of the number and complexity of acquisitions in the 2014 financial year, the company 
retains the option of a retroactive adjustment: disclosures are provisional for measurement of the 
brand, fair value of the consideration and deferred taxation commensurate with ifrs 3.45. the 
allocation of acquisition costs for this business combination to the acquired assets and liabilities using 
the provisional purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date is as follows: 
in keur  fair value after acquisition
intangible assets (provisional)  2,301
property, plant and equipment  45
financial assets  2
trade receivables  286
other assets  715
cash and cash equivalents  100

trade payables  -77
deferred tax liabilities (provisional)  -620
net assets  2,638

goodwill  11,958
 
above all, goodwill is not attributed to separately identifiable assets such as the positive future 
business outlook, employee expertise and the expected synergy effects arising from integration. 
goodwill is irrelevant for taxation. acquired intangible assets are not subject to an indefinite useful life. 
the gross amount of acquired trade receivables amounted to keur 286 and corresponded to the fair 
value. other operating expenses for the financial year recognized transaction costs of keur 101 for 
the acquisition of clickdelivery. 
12 
 
since first-time inclusion as of august 1, 2014, clickdelivery has contributed keur 530 to group 
revenue  and  keur -3,929  to  consolidated  profit/loss.  had  clickdelivery  already  been  fully 
consolidated on january 1, 2014, clickdelivery would have contributed keur 1,104 to group revenue 
and keur -5,254 to consolidated profit/loss. 
d)  pizza.de group 
 
by agreement dated august 14, 2014, the company acquired directly or indirectly all shares in

the provisionally determined fair value of the brand was calculated using the multi-period excess 
earnings method; the value of customer and supplier relationships was determined on the basis of 
replacement costs. on account of the number and complexity of acquisitions in the 2014 financial 
year,  the  company  retains  the  option  of  making  a  retroactive  adjustment.  disclosures  on  the 
measurement of the brand, customer base and deferred taxation are provisional commensurate with 
ifrs 3.45. 
acquired intangible assets are all subject to a finite useful life.  
taking into account net assets, disclosed items in the statement of financial position and deferred 
taxation, provisional goodwill of keur 110,869 is determined. this is mainly comprised of expected 
savings through synergy effects and the positive effects from the increased market share of the 
group. 
13 
 
the gross amount of acquired trade receivables amounted to keur 2,598 and corresponded to the 
fair value. other operating expenses for the financial year recognized transaction costs of keur 427 
for the acquisition of pizza.de group.

keur 33,306 to group revenue and keur -8,453 to consolidated profit/loss. since august 1, 2014, 
pizza.de group has made a contribution of keur 12,378 to group revenue and keur -11,136 to

put/call options at baedaltong co., ltd. is based on a contractually determined subsequent settlement 
of deferred consideration. 
on account of the number and complexity of acquisitions in the 2014 financial year, the company 
retains the option of making a retroactive adjustment. disclosures on the measurement of the brand, 
the fair value of the consideration and deferred taxation are provisional commensurate with ifrs 3.45.

as the acquisition date for these companies was december 31, 2014, the two companies have not 
made any contribution to group sales or the consolidated profit/loss. had these companies already

group revenue and keur -537 to consolidated profit/loss. 
g)  china 
 
with legally binding effect as of december 31, 2014, 100% of shares in shanghai ai can business

under review, amounts to keur 2,836. transaction costs for the business combination amount in total 
to keur 32 and were recognized under other operating expenses in the period.

acquired assets are all subject to a finite useful life. 
taking into account net assets, inclusive of disclosed hidden reserves and charges as well as deferred 
taxation, goodwill (not relevant for taxation) of keur 1,667 is determined. this is mainly comprised of 
expected savings through synergy effects and growth potential for the chinese market for internet 
food orders. 
the gross amount of acquired trade receivables amounted to keur 234 and corresponded to the fair 
value. 
had the acquisition been reported already as of january 1, 2014, a contribution of keur 26 to group

5.  currency translation 
currency translation is made in accordance with the functional currency concept. the functional 
currency for all subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements of dhh is the respective 
local currency. the consolidated financial statements are prepared in euro (reporting currency). 
transactions not conducted in the functional currency of an entity included in the consolidation group 
(foreign currency transactions) are translated into the functional currency of the respective unit at the 
rate  on  the  transaction  date.  exchange  gains  and  losses  arising  from  the  settlement  of  such 
transactions and from the measurement of monetary assets and liabilities are recognized in the 
income statement at the closing rate in the separate financial statements. 
18 
 
for the purposes of inclusion in the consolidated financial statements of dhh, subsidiaries that do not 
have the euro as functional currency translate their separate financial statements, prepared in local 
currency, into the euro reporting currency as follows: 
(cid:129)  assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate, income and expenses are translated at 
the average rate. differences arising from currency translation are shown separately in equity. 
(cid:129)  equity subject to obligatory first-time consolidation in the course of acquiring international 
subsidiaries is translated at the respective reporting date with the historical rate at the date of 
acquisition. differences arising from currency translation are shown separately in equity. 
(cid:129)  as  long  as  the  subsidiary  is  included  in  the  group  of  consolidated  entities,  translation 
differences are continued in group equity. if subsidiaries leave the group of consolidated 
entities, the corresponding translation difference are reclassified from equity to profit or loss. 
(cid:129)  goodwill and restatements of the fair value of assets and liabilities due to acquisitions of 
international subsidiaries are treated as assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries and 
translated with the rate as of the reporting date.  
(cid:129)  there are no subsidiaries registered in hyperinflation countries pursuant to ias 29.  
(cid:129)  currency translation differences arising from the translation of shares in one international 
subsidiary as well as from loans, which are a part of the net investment in this international 
subsidiary,  are  recognized  in  equity.  if  an  international  subsidiary  leaves  the  group  of 
consolidated  entities,  the  currency  translation  differences  are  derecognized  through  the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 
the following exchange rates (rounded) were used for currency translation:

d.  accounting policies 
1.  recognition of income and expenses 
expenses and income are not offset unless ifrs accounting requirements permit this or require 
offsetting. 
a)  revenue 
 
the dh group generates revenue from commission and fees for linking to the delivery hero online 
platform, for the provision of order confirmation terminals at contractual partners, for eye-catching 
presentation on the dh order platform (premium placement) and for the use of credit cards. 
commission is collected from restaurants for order forwarding via the delivery hero online platform.  
in generating commission income, the dh group acts as an agent as the dh group is solely an 
intermediary  between  the  main  supplier  and  the  end  customer.  the  corresponding  revenue  is 
recognized as soon as the customer's online order is completed. commissions are recognized at fair 
value less discounts, value added tax and other price discounts. 
furthermore, dhh provides contractual partners with order confirmation terminals to confirm order 
acceptance directly to the customer via the delivery hero online platform. the dh group provides 
terminals on a leasing or purchase basis. in the case of selling a terminal, revenue is recognized as 
soon as the risks and rewards arising from the goods are transferred to customers, namely upon 
delivery. 
connection fees are realized directly after contact to the delivery hero online platform. fees are 
payable in all cases. 
fees for the use of credit cards are realized as soon as the customer order is fully processed and no 
further performance obligations are to be fulfilled on the part of the dh group. 
revenue from premium placement is realized over the period in which this service is rendered by dh. 
b)  customer loyalty program 
 
some dh group companies apply customer loyalty programs; customers can use these to collect 
points (award credits) through placing orders, entitling them to discounted ordering in future. 
award credits are recognized as separately identifiable components of sales transactions. the fair 
value of the consideration received in the course of the original sale is allocated to award credits and 
other components of the transaction. the relative fair value method is used to determine values. 
the award-credit portion of the consideration is recognized as revenue when the credit is redeemed 
and the group company has fulfilled its obligation to surrender the credit. (refer also to e.15). the 
amount of revenue is determined by the number of surrendered award credits in relation to the total 
number of expected credits to be redeemed. award credits expire 12 months after the day of the 
original transaction. 
20 
 
c)  interest and similar income 
 
interest income is recognized as income when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the 
company and the extent of the income can be reliably determined. 
d)  expenses 
 
expenses are presented in the income statement as soon as the underlying service has been 
rendered. 
 
2.  property, plant and equipment 
items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses. cost also comprises incidental purchase costs less price reductions.  
depreciation occurs on a straight-line basis over the time period of the expected useful life of the 
asset. 
in the reporting year, depreciation is based on the following useful lives: 
useful life in years  2014  2013 
operating and office equipment  2-25  2-25 
leasehold improvements  8-20  10-20 
 
in addition, processes are introduced which take account of the requirements of ias 36 in respect of 
impairment of assets. the residual carrying amount as well as estimates of the expected useful life are 
checked at each reporting date for the occurrence of events that no longer justify the measurement. if 
the  carrying  amount  exceeds  the  recoverable  amount  for  the  individual  asset  value,  additional 
impairment losses are recognized directly in the income statement. if the requirements for impairment 
in following years are no longer in place, prior corrections are reversed. 
repair and maintenance expenses are expensed at the time of their occurrence. material innovations 
and improvements are capitalized. 
 
3.  intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets acquired for consideration are carried at amortized cost. they are amortized on a 
straight-line  basis  over  their  individual  useful  lives.  internally  generated  intangible  assets  are 
measured  at  cost  and  amortized  over  their  estimated  useful  lives.  development  expenditure  is 
capitalized if development costs can be reliably measured, the product or process is technically and 
commercially feasible, future benefit is probable and the group intends and has sufficient resources to 
be able to complete development and use or sell the asset. other development expenditure are 
expensed as incurred. capitalized development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated 
amortization and accumulated impairment losses. research costs are expensed as incurred. 
21 
 
the expected useful life of the brand is forecast in accordance with verifiable history and observable 
user  behavior.  the  underlying  useful  life  of  customer  and  supplier  relationships  is  determined 
individually corresponding to historical migration rates.  
an annual review of intangible assets pursuant to ias 36 is made to check for necessary impairment 
losses in the dh group. this checks for the presence of indications of impairment. in this case, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the asset concerned. this is the higher of fair value less costs of 
disposal or its value in use. market interest rates before tax are used for discounting. 
in the reporting year, depreciation is based on the following useful lives: 
useful life in years  2014  2013 
software  2-3  2-3 
brands  5-25  5 
customer and supplier relationships  3-10  - 
 
goodwill principally results from the acquisition of subsidiaries and corresponds to the sum of the 
transferred consideration, the amount of all non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value 
of the previously held equity interests in the acquiree less the fair value of acquired net assets. if the 
fair value of the acquired net assets exceeds the sum of the transferred consideration, the amount of 
all non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the previously held equity interests, 
the difference is directly recognized in the income statement. 
in accordance with ifrs 3, goodwill is subjected to an impairment test pursuant to ias 36 annually as 
well as in the case of indications of impairment. for the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to a cash generating unit (cgu), the future cash flows of which are interdependent. in the 
dh group, cgus are largely monitored at the level of the operating segment, which – barring three 
exceptions in the international part of the group – corresponds to the individual companies. 
an impairment is made if the carrying amount of the individual cgu, to which goodwill is allocated, 
exceeds the recoverable amount. this recoverable amount corresponds to the higher of fair value less 
costs of disposal and its value in use. as the fair value cannot be reliably determined, testing for 
impairment of the value in use is made. 
the value in use of the cgu was calculated by applying the discounted cash flow method, as follows: 
owing to the character of the acquired business and the condition of the business not yet being in full 
swing,  10-year  detailed  planning  and,  subsequently,  revenue  growth  of  1%  into  perpetuity  was 
considered for the valuation model. this forms the basis for determining the expected future free cash 
flows (before interest and taxes) of the cash-generating unit.  
the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) is used for discounting the thus determined excess 
cash flows; the wacc reflects the rate of return required by the capital markets to grant debt or equity 
capital to the dh group.  
cost of equity is determined using the capital asset pricing model (capm). the beta factor is derived 
from a peer group of comparable businesses. 
22 
 
on the basis of the determined free cash flows before tax, a weighted average cost of capital before 
tax is used for testing goodwill for impairment.  
as part of annual impairment testing as of december 31, 2014, a sensitivity analysis was also 
conducted. in each case, an increase of the base rate by 100 bps, a proportional reduction of planned 
annual revenue growth by 10% and an absolute reduction of the planned ebitda margin by 5% was 
assumed for this. none of these adjustments led to a need for a write-down.   
no impairment requirement was determined in the reporting period. any possible impairment loss is 
not reversed in subsequent periods. 
 
4.  leases 
a)  accounting as lessee 
the dh group has entered into lease arrangements which do not meet the criteria for finance leases 
and are consequently classified as operating lease agreements.  lease payments are recognized as 
expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
b)  accounting as lessor 
 
some companies in the dh group act as lessors in terms of order confirmation terminals which 
restaurants put into place to directly confirm order acceptance to the customer via the delivery hero 
online  platform.  as  significant  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  are  retained  by  the  dhh,  these 
agreements are classified as operating leases pursuant to ias 17. 
accordingly, dhh depreciates terminals on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life and 
recognizes  lease  payments  in  a  similar  way  over  the  term  of  the  lease  agreement. 
 
5.  inventories 
inventories are carried at cost which is determined on the basis of direct production costs and 
production-related overheads.  inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value as 
of each reporting date.  
cost includes all costs of purchase, production and other costs that are incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition. the first-in, first-out method (fifo) is used to 
measure cost. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion 
 
and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
 
6.  income tax 
taxes on income for the period are the sum of current and deferred income taxes. these are 
recognized in the consolidated income statement unless they relate to items recognized directly in 
equity or other comprehensive income. in this case, income tax is also recognized directly in equity or 
other comprehensive income. 
23 
 
a)  current income tax 
 
the current income tax expense is calculated by applying the tax regulations enacted on the reporting 
date in countries in which the dh group operates and taxable income is generated. in assessing 
income tax demands and liabilities, estimates must be partially made. a deviating tax assessment by 
the respective tax authorities cannot be excluded. the associated uncertainty is taken into account by 
only stating uncertain tax demands and liabilities if the probability of occurrence from the perspective 
of dhh is greater than 50%. the expected tax payment is taken as a base as best estimate for the 
recognition of uncertain tax items. 
b)  deferred income tax 
 
deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements and  the corresponding  tax  bases  used  in  the 
computation  of  taxable  income.  furthermore,  deferred  tax  assets  are  recognized  for  tax  loss 
carryforwards. 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences.  
deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards to the extent 
to which it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences and/or loss carryforwards can be utilized. 
deferred taxes are measured in accordance with ias 12. the tax rate used corresponds to the 
adopted or virtually adopted tax rate which is relevant to the period of the reversal of temporary 
differences and/or loss carryforwards.  
the change in deferred taxes is recognized in the income statement provided it relates to items in the 
statement of financial position which were recognized in the income statement. if the items in the 
statement  of  financial  position  directly  relate  to  equity  or  other  comprehensive  income,  the 
corresponding deferred taxes are also recognized in these items.  
deferred tax assets and liabilities arising through temporary differences related to investments in 
subsidiaries, associates or joint arrangements are taken into account unless the date for reversal of 
temporary  differences  can  be  determined  at  group  level  and  it  is  probable  that  the  temporary 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if the group has a legally enforceable right to 
set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to 
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and concern the same taxable entity. in addition, 
deferred taxes concerning items in the statement of financial position with the same maturity are 
offset. 
 
7.  financial instruments 
a)  financial assets 
in accordance with ias 39, financial assets are broken down into the following categories: 
a)  assets measured at fair value through profit or loss 
24 
 
b)  loans and receivables 
c)  financial assets held for sale 
classification is made at first-time recognition. 
re. a) 
financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  financial  assets  held  for  trading.  this 
classification is made if the asset was acquired with the intention to sell in the short term. these 
assets are shown as current if their realization is expected within 12 months. all other assets are 
shown as non-current. 
derivative financial instruments are measured upon initial recognition and subsequently at fair value. 
financial derivatives held for trading purposes are recognized as current assets. 
as of december 31, 2013, an asset-side derivative to buy kinboy group was exercised in 2014. in 
addition, the dh group holds an option to buy dfs ug, berlin. the two options relate to level 3 
derivatives. 
re. b) 
loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that 
are not traded in an active market. they are included in current assets as long as their maturities do 
not extend beyond 12 months after the reporting date. otherwise they are classified as non-current 
assets. 
loans and receivables are stated at the date of first-time recognition at fair value plus transaction 
costs. subsequent measurement occurs at amortized cost. 
using empirical values and individual risk assessments, possible default risks are recognized using 
appropriate impairment taking into consideration net cash flows. in doing so, a distinction is made 
between specific valuation allowances and general valuation allowances. objective indications of the 
materialization of an impairment loss could be the following: indications of financial difficulties at a 
customer  or  group  of  customers,  default  or  delay  in  paying  interest  or  principal,  a  heightened 
probability of insolvency or observable data that point to a quantifiable contraction in estimated future 
cash flows from a group of financial assets. in the case of general valuation allowances, the group 
uses historical information on the timing of payments and the extent of losses occurring, adjusted by 
the executive board judging whether the current general business environment and credit conditions 
are such that the actual losses are probably higher or lower than the losses that would have been 
expected based on historical trends. 
if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment falls and this fall results from circumstances 
occurring after the first-time recognition of the impairment, the reversal of the impairment loss is 
recognized in the consolidated income statement. 
impairment losses are indirectly recognized through an allowance account. in the event of there being 
no realistic prospect of the receivable being collected, the carrying amount of the receivable is 
derecognized from the allowance account. 
 
25 
 
re. c) 
held-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value if this can be reliably determined. if this is not 
possible, these assets are measured at cost less impairment losses.  
cash and cash equivalents comprise all cash-related assets which have a remaining term of less than 
three months at the date of acquisition or investment. cash and cash equivalents are measured at 
nominal value.  
 
b)  financial liabilities 
 
pursuant to ias 39, financial liabilities are broken down into the following categories: 
a)  at amortized acquisition cost 
b)  measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
re. a) 
financial liabilities are stated at fair value taking into account transaction costs as well as premiums 
and discounts at initial recognition. the fair value at the date of the financial liability being incurred 
corresponds to the present value of future payment obligations based on a market interest rate with a 
matching term and risk.  
subsequent measurement occurs at amortized cost using the effective interest method. the effective 
interest rate is determined at the date liabilities to banks are incurred. 
amendments to the terms and conditions in respect of the amount and/or date of interest and principal 
payments result in remeasurement of the carrying amount of the liability in the amount of the present 
value and on the basis of the originally determined effective interest rate. differences to the carrying 
amount of the liability previously stated are recognized in profit or loss. if changes in terms and 
conditions lead to materially different contract terms pursuant to ias 39.ag 62, the original liability is 
treated in accordance with ias 39.40 as if it were fully paid off. recognition subsequently occurs as a 
new liability at fair value. 
re. b) 
financial  liabilities  which  are  measured  at  fair  value  relate  to  options  written  on  dhh  shares 
(subscription right agreements or warrants). 
dh  group  holds  additional  derivative  financial  instruments  as  financial  liabilities  resulting  from 
purchase price allocations; these concern written put options and purchased call options (synthetic 
forward transactions) on non-controlling interests of acquired companies kinboy international s.a. 
(pedidosya  group),  inversiones  cmr  s.a.s.  (clickdelivery  group)  and  baedaltong  co.  ltd.  in 
addition, in the case of pedidosya group there is a variable purchase price component for non-
controlling interests valued in dhh's own shares. these relate to level 3 derivatives.  
as of december 31, 2013, as well as january 1, 2013, subscription right agreements exist which 
provide for the acquisition of a designated number of shares in dhh each bearing the nominal value 
of  eur 1.00  at  a  designated  subscription  price.  with  the  redemption  of  the  loan  linked  to  the 
subscription right agreement in 2014, dhh's obligation to meet this agreement lapsed. in 2014, a new 
subscription right agreement was concluded with investors during the year which was already settled 
before the reporting date. all warrants relate to level 3 derivatives. 
26 
 
8.  employee benefits 
a)  pension obligations 
pension obligations and similar obligations arise from the obligations of one dh group entity to its 
employees. the obligations of these defined benefit plans are measured using the projected unit credit 
method. under this method, expected future increases in salaries and pensions are taken into account 
in addition to the pensions and acquired pension entitlements known at the reporting date. 
pension obligations are determined by independent actuaries. effects arising from the remeasurement 
of actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the impact of any 
asset ceiling (excluding interest) are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income. the discount rate stated reflects the interest rate generated by senior 
fixed-interest bonds with matching maturities on the reporting date. 
the fair value of any plan assets is deducted from the discounted pension obligation. 
the interest rate effect included in pension expenses is recognized in the consolidated statement of 
profit or loss and other comprehensive income under interest expenses. service cost is shown in 
individual functional areas in operating profit. 
b)  share-based payment 
dhh grants group management and selected senior management share-based payment in the form of 
virtual shares (options). these virtual options mature as soon as an 'exit event' occurs. the acquisition 
of more than 75% of shares in dhh by one or more investors, as well as the liquidation of the 
company, is defined as an exit event. 
the components recognized in the income statement beyond the exercise period correspond to the 
fair value of options at the date of their being granted as the obligation by dhh is made in cash and/or 
in cash equivalents. in this regard, the fair value is determined using recognized measurement 
models. recognition of the obligation and/or its increase or decrease over time occurs in general 
administration expenses. 
 
9.  other provisions 
other provisions are set up if a legal or constructive obligation to the dh group resulting from a past 
event exists, its fulfilment is probable and its amount can be reliably determined. recognition is made 
in the amount of the expected settlement amount.  
in view of estimation uncertainty in determining the amount, the actual outflow of resources may 
deviate from the original amounts recognized on the basis of estimates. 
non-current provisions are recognized at the discounted settlement amount on the reporting date 
based on corresponding term and risk matching interest rates. 
 
27 
 
10.  fair value of financial instruments  
the fair value of financial instruments is determined on the basis of corresponding market values or 
valuation methods. the fair value of cash and cash equivalents and other current primary financial 
instruments  corresponds  approximately  to  the  carrying  amounts  recognized  on  the  respective 
reporting dates.  
the fair value of non-current receivables as well as other assets and liabilities is determined based on 
the expected cash flow using the reference interest rates valid at the reporting date. the fair value of 
derivatives is determined on the basis of option pricing models. 
the fair value of financial instruments carried on the statement of financial position is principally 
determined using corresponding market or exchange prices. if no market or exchange prices are 
available, measurement is made using standard valuation methods taking account of instrument-
specific market parameters. fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method, whereby 
individual credit ratings and other market conditions are taken into account in the form of standard 
credit and/or liquidity spreads in determining present value.  
11.  determination of fair value 
according to the provisions of ifrs 13, fair value is the price that would be generated by the sale of 
the asset or paid to transfer a liability in the primary market or, if this is not available, the most 
advantageous market. fair value is to be determined using measurement parameters which are as 
market-based as possible as the input factors. the measurement hierarchy (fair value hierarchy) 
attributes three stages in descending order for input factors used in the valuation technique, placing 
the highest priority on the most market-based inputs: 
(cid:129) level 1: market prices (unadjusted) used in an active market for identical assets or liabilities which 
the entity can access on the valuation date. 
(cid:129) level 2: measurement parameters other than level 1 quoted prices which can be observed for assets 
or liabilities, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices). 
(cid:129) level 3: measurement parameters for assets and liabilities that are not based on observable market 
data.  
where various input factors are relevant for measurement, the fair value is categorized at the same 
level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. 
 
12.  government grants 
government grants are recognized if there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be made and 
the entity complies with the conditions attached to them. expense-related grants are recognized as 
income over the period required to offset them with the corresponding expenses that the grants are 
meant to compensate for. expenditure allowances for the employment of specific employees in korea 
and australia are recognized directly in profit or loss (2014: keur 100; 2013: keur 0). there are no 
unfulfilled restrictions and other contingencies related to recognized government assistance in the 
consolidated financial statements. 
 
28 
 
13.  judgment and use of estimates 
in the application of accounting policies and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, 
management makes decisions based on judgment and estimates. this applies in particular to the 
following cases: 
a)  judgments 
 
going concern assumption: 
dhh continues to be reliant on external financial resources; in 2015 considerable equity and debt 
financing was raised to secure future business activities. as a consequence, the going concern 
assumption is deemed to be satisfied. 
revenue recognition of commission income: 
dhh classifies its intermediary activity as agent activity as dhh does not act as the main supplier, is 
not exposed to storage risk, cannot influence the pricing of counterparties and receives commission as 
remuneration. 
use of the anticipated acquisition method for acquisitions: 
for  put  options  written  on  remaining  non-controlling  interests  in  the  course  of  acquisitions,  the 
company makes use of its de facto option and recognizes the put options as if they had already been 
exercised in accordance with the anticipated acquisition method  as a consequence, put options are 
treated as contingent considerations. to that effect, no non-controlling interests are shown for these 
interests in group equity. 
b)  assumptions and estimation uncertainties 
 
recognition and measurement of other provisions 
in respect of recognition and measurement, there are uncertainties in respect of future price increases 
as well as in respect of the extent, date and probability of utilization of the respective provision. 
measurement of financial liabilities 
in  measuring  financial  liabilities,  estimates  of  future  cash  flows  and any  changes  in  terms  and 
conditions are of particular significance. furthermore, estimates are required for entity-specific risk 
premiums. 
scope for recognizing deferred tax assets 
an excess of deferred tax assets is only recognized if it is probable that future tax benefits can be 
realized based on tax budgets. the current taxable profit situation in future reporting years and thus 
the actual usability of deferred tax assets can vary from the estimate made at the date of recognizing 
deferred  taxation.  recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets  on  tax  loss  carryforwards  or  temporary 
differences is made based on future taxable income as part of a planning horizon of five reporting 
years. 
share-based payment (ifrs 2) 
in  respect  of  the  accounting  of  virtual  shares,  assumptions  and  estimates  are  made  for  the 
development of performance indicators and fluctuation as well as the determination of entity value. 
these are determined using option pricing models. 
29 
 
goodwill impairment testing 
determination of the recoverable amount requires assumptions and estimates, in particular on the 
future development of ebit and sustainable growth rates. 
additional comments on the assumptions and estimates made are listed in the individual financial 
statement items in the disclosures. all assumptions and estimates are based on the conditions 
prevailing and assessments at the reporting date. 
in assessing the future business development, the business environment, assumed as realistic at this 
point, was also taken into account for the sectors and regions in which the dh group operates. while 
management assumes that the assumptions and estimates used are appropriate, any unforeseeable 
changes to these assumptions could affect the group's net assets, financial position and results of 
operations.

the increase in the carrying amount for leasehold improvements in 2014 is mainly due to additions as 
part of an acquisition. the increase in the carrying amount for operating and office equipment is based 
on an increase in purchasing driven by strong growth of operations as well as additions due to 
acquisitions. for acquisitions in the financial year, please refer also to section c.3. 
31 
 
impairment losses were taken on leasehold improvements in 2014; these relate primarily to the 
relocation of operating activities of a dh entity. 
operating and office equipment includes facilities leased by the group to third parties as short-term 
operating leases that can be terminated at short notice: these facilities have the following carrying 
amounts: 
keur  31.12.2014 31.12.2013  01.01.2013

accumulated amortization and depreciation on jan. 1  -7 0  0
amortization and depreciation during the financial year  -74 -7  0
net carrying amount  558 98  0
 
as operating leases can generally be terminated by the lessee at any time, disclosure of minimum 
lease payments is waived.

b)  impairment testing on goodwill 
we refer to the explanations in d.3. for the general assumptions and methods for conducting an 
impairment test. 
for the purpose of testing for impairment, goodwill is allocated to the cgus of the group as follows: 
keur  2014 2013
lieferheld  68.082 24.509
pizza.de  67.299 0
online pizza norden  37.965 37.965
subtotal  173.346 62.475
various units without significant         
goodwill  67.367                                                 18.274 
 
total  240.712 80.749
 
the increase in goodwill of keur 43,572 for lieferheld results from the acquisition of pizza.de. as 
synergy effects arise for lieferheld, goodwill was reallocated by pizza.de to lieferheld using an 
allocation formula of 39.3%.  
the recoverable amount for the aforementioned cgus is based on the value in use as fair value 
cannot be reliably determined. the following assumptions were made in determining value in use: 
perpetual    
annuity 
wacc  ebitda  growth    
in %  2014  2013 2014 2013 2014  2013
lieferheld  12,6  17,4 40,4 27,6 1,0  1,0
opn  13,2  17,4 54,3 34,9 1,0  1,0
pizza.de  9,6  - 53,2 - 1,0  -
other  15,7  17,9 29,3 23,5 1,0  1,0
 
the determination of value in use for cgus led in all cases to a recoverable amount exceeding the 
carrying amounts stated above. as a consequence, there is no impairment requirement for the current 
reporting period. 
derivation of the equity component of wacc is based on a uniform risk-free base rate of 1.75% for 
the  eur  area  (py: 2.75%)  and  a  cgu-specific  risk  premium  of  between  6.8%  and  22.8% 
(py: 14.0% –15.8%). the risk premium contains adjustment components for inflation and country risk 
as well as market risk and cgu-specific premiums, which depend largely on the period of occurrence 
and are reduced as the history is extended. in addition, an entity-specific risk factor (beta factor) of 
1.16 is used across cgus. tax rates of between 18.0% and 30.8% are used dependent on the cgu.

the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities between the years 2013 and 2014 mainly results from 
the acquisition of companies in 2014 and the related recognition of deferred tax liabilities on the 
hidden reserves disclosed in the course of the purchase price allocation. 
the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities results from the effects, presented below; in the 
process, recognition of the change directly in equity does not apply. for significant deferred tax assets

an increase in capital reserves by keur 303,787 resulted from premiums paid in the course of the 
aforementioned ten capital increases. in addition, capital reserves increased by keur 9,995 due to 
the equity component of a loan and the deferred tax liability in part attributed to this. the change in

the reconciliation effect due to continuous differences in the 2014 financial year results mainly from a 
loan granted to dhh and the associated warrants (see section e. 10c)). 
g.  disclosures on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the consolidated statement of cash flows was prepared in accordance with ias 7 and shows the 
inflow and outflow of cash flows during the reporting year. transition of the prior year's statement of 
cash flows from hgb to ifrs in 2013 is presented in section b.3c). 
cash flows are broken down into cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing 
activities and cash flows from financing activities. the cash flows arising from operating activities are 
determined using the indirect method pursuant to ias 7.18 (b). 
the cash and cash equivalents shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows correspond to cash 
and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position, namely cash on hand and at banks; please 
refer to section e.9. cash and cash equivalents amount to keur 32,829 as of december 31, 2014, 
(december 31,  2013:  keur 9,286;  january 1,  2013:  keur 9,459)  and  are  not  subject  to  any 
restrictions on disposal. please refer to section c.4 in respect of possible restrictions due to currency 
controls in china and argentina. 
the negative cash flow from operating activities in 2013 and 2014 results mainly from the loss for the 
period and the increase in current assets. the increase in trade receivables and other assets reflects 
in particular the company's growth. the cash flow from investing activities in 2014 mainly comprises 
the acquisitions presented in c.3 and investments in intangible fixed assets, mainly it software.  
53 
 
the cash flow from financing activities reflects the cash increase in equity capital in 2013 and 2014. in 
addition, further debt was raised in 2013 and 2014. the two contributed to securing the dh group's 
operations. the group is positioned very broadly in asia, australia, europe and south america, 
nevertheless it has not yet reached break-even. 
aggregated disclosures on assets and liabilities of acquired subsidiaries, inclusive of the acquired 
cash and cash equivalents and cash components of remuneration of the acquisition, are to be found in 
section c.3. disclosures on deconsolidation are to be found in section c.4. 
h.  other disclosures 
1.  share-based payment – ifrs 2 program 
the dh group has been operating a share-based payment program since 2011 so that top-level 
management participates in the development of the company and its contribution to the sustained 
success of the dh group is honored in comparison to the competition. the group of beneficiaries 
comprises members of management and the top management of delivery hero holding gmbh as well 
as management bodies and the top management of affiliates of the dh group. 
a)  description of the program 
four programs (vsp i-iv) were approved by the advisory board of the company. shares in individual 
programs are distributed as follows: 
program  shares  expired shares 
vsp i  764 332
vsp ii  958 264
vsp iii  3.600 1.254
vsp iv  7.072 329
total  12.394 2.179
 
the nominal value of each virtual share amounts to eur 1.00. shares are issued successively 
following approval. 
entitled  persons  have  an  individual  contractual  claim  on  the  company  for  payment  of  a  cash 
equivalent to the shares issued. in the case of a material change in the shareholder structure ('exit'), 
these claims are immediately payable. an exit is deemed to exist if a sale or transfer of more than 
75% of all shares in the company occurs. an exchange or acquisition as part of an individual 
transaction or a series of consecutive transactions as well as a sale or transfer of more than 75% of 
assets or a liquidation or de facto liquidation of the company is treated in the same way.  
in the case of an exit, all claims on virtual shares already issued are immediately due for payment at 
the date of concluding the transaction. following the exit, tendered claims are being assigned on a 
monthly basis. the number of shares issued is individually specified in contractual agreements. in 
addition, additional or other tender scenarios or criteria governing the vested nature are individually 
specified and defined in the individual contractual agreements. the company, however, proceeded in 
2014 to standardize these arrangements in their entirety.  
54 
 
the  exercise  prices  agreed  in  the  programs  (strike  prices)  vary  in  the  range  presented  below 
depending on the issuance date of the subscription right. 
program  vsp i  vsp ii  vsp iii  vsp iv 
strike price (in eur/unit)  0 - 1  956  1.052  1.750 
 
no rights to the subscription of gmbh ownership interests of the company and dividends resulting 
from ownership interests or distributions from the virtual shares are granted to entitled persons. in the 
event of conversion of the gmbh into a stock corporation, the virtual shares would be converted into 
share options. the arrangement for these share options after conversion to a stock corporation, e.g. 
whether settlement occurs in shares or in cash, has not yet been made. 
the virtual share program ends on december 31, 2030. the individual agreements can be terminated 
by the company with effect from december 31, 2030. in the case of termination of agreements as of 
or after december 31, 2030, the company must provide compensation payment. 
all taxes, other levies or fees, which accompany the issuance of virtual shares or cash payments as 
part of these agreements are to be borne by the beneficiary and may be withheld by the company and 
deducted  from  payments  as  part  of  this  agreement.  excluded  from  this  are  the  corresponding 
employer's contributions which were added into the calculation. 
b)  vesting period/non-forfeiture 
to the extent that there are no other arrangements in individual agreements, the contractual vesting 
period extends over a period of 48 months. prior to the commencement of the contractual vesting 
period, an additional vesting period (cliff) of up to 12 months can be arranged on the part of the issuer 
and a period of up to 24 months can be arranged individually by the participant between the company 
and the beneficiary. these vesting periods have an impact on non-forfeiture as they present a type of 
waiting period from the beginning of the contractual subscription period and non-forfeiture of individual 
claims can materialize only at a later date. if the work or engagement relationship, irrespective of the 
reason, ends during the vesting period, the virtual shares expire.  
employees who opt to leave the company ('bad leaver') have no claim to virtual shares.  
measurement of share-based payment of employees is made using an option pricing model (black-
scholes model) based on the valuation of a call option on the company's shares. the volatilities used 
for this are derived by applying a standard peer group. the exit was assumed for the maturity of the 
options, namely june 30, 2016. market prices were determined using a company valuation. the 
exercise price corresponds to the aforementioned strike prices. to derive the underlying company 
valuation, a dcf-based company valuation was conducted based on the business plan and the 
statement of financial position as of the reporting date; the parameters for discounting the recovery of 
capital  correspond  to  the  specifications  given  for  impairment  testing  (refer  to  section e.2.b)). 
assumptions regarding the key performance indicators of the business plan, such as the underlying 
ebitda margin, were also applied. in addition, in respect of the distribution of possible exit proceeds, 
the existing liquidity preferences of the equity provider were taken into account in the form applying as 
of the respective reporting date. the measurement made using these parameters is presented below. 
changes in the measurement of liabilities arising from share-based payment were recognized through 
profit or loss in the respective period.

dhh loans liabilities are recognized at amortized cost. thus the carrying amount does not correspond 
to the fair value. the fair value of loan liabilities is determined as the present value of future cash flows 
taking account of risk-less interest rates valid as of the reporting date and a specific risk premium for 
dhh. 
 
net result by measurement category: 
in accordance with ifrs 7.20 (a), net gains and losses of financial instruments are to be disclosed for

no reconciliation between level 2 and level 3 took place during the financial year. 
released gains and losses from the change in level 3 instruments are recognized in the finance 
income/expense. unrealized gains or losses are recognized in revenue reserves and other reserves. 
the fair value of warrants is determined using a binomial model. measurement is made at each 
relevant reporting date. the company did not hold warrants as of december 31, 2014. in the course 
of  the  measurement  process,  the  required  publicly-available  market  data  is  collected  and 
unobservable input parameters are updated using internal calculations. the latter relates in particular 
to the value determined for each company share of delivery hero using a discounted cash flow model 
and the volatility derived from this. both parameters were updated on each measurement date. 
the future payment obligation for non-controlling shares for pedidosya and clickdelivery is linked via 
different contractual parameters to the company value of dhh at the date of the exit event. owing to 
this interdependence, the fair value of put/call options is determined using monte carlo simulations. 
measurement is made at each relevant reporting date. in the course of the measurement process, the 
required publicly-available market data is collected and unobservable input parameters are updated 
using internal calculations. the latter relates in particular to the value determined for each company 
share of dhh using a discounted cash flow model and the volatility derived from this. both parameters 
were updated on each measurement date. with respect to the determined value, the parameter 
having a material impact on the measurement result using the discounted cash flow method is the 
value per dhh company share.  
in line with the presentation above, for the calculation of the fair value of the variable purchase price 
component of pedidosya group valued in own dhh shares use is made of a discounted cash flow 
method to determined value per dhh company share. the option value is calculated using the black-
scholes model.  
the significant unobservable input parameters of the model to calculate the value of dhh shares are 
found in section e.2.b). the estimated fair value of options would rise (decline) if the dhh share price 
was to rise (fall). 
by contrast, the measurement of put/call options at baedaltong co., ltd. is based on a contractually 
determined subsequent settlement of deferred consideration. 
61 
 
both options to purchase, which are recognized as an asset, are measured at cost in accordance with 
ias 39.46 (c) as the fair value of the options cannot be reliably determined. this concerns unquoted 
business units, the fair value of which cannot be readily and reliably determined. 
b)  risk management 
the dh group considers itself exposed to default risks, liquidity risks and market risks, especially 
interest rate and foreign exchange risks, through the use of financial instruments. dhh actively 
monitors  these  risks  and  manages  them  using  an  effective  risk  management  system.  the  risk 
management function is integrated into group controlling. for a description of the risks arising from 
the use of financial instruments, we also refer to the relevant comments in the group management 
report. 
c)  credit risk 
the credit or default risk is the risk that the business partners, mainly restaurants, are unable to fulfill 
their payment obligations, which would mean the dh group incurs a loss. such risks mainly involve 
current trade receivables. the dh group does not regard itself as being exposed to a major default 
risk from any single individual customer. concentration of the creditworthiness risk is limited due to the 
broad and heterogeneous customer base. the dh monitors the default risk and manages this actively 
by making any necessary credit checks and by optimizing the payment process. consequently, the 
risk is largely transferred to the restaurants, also by way of an effective dunning system. 
the maximum default risk corresponds to the carrying amount of the financial assets. 
in addition, the following table presents the maturity structure of the financial assets that are not 
impaired, not past due date as well as those due as of the reporting date. in respect of receivables 
which are neither impaired nor past due date, there was no indication on the reporting date that the 
debtors would not meet their payment obligations.

d)  liquidity risks 
owing to strong external growth, the dh group has to rely on external financing to ensure sufficient 
liquidity. a lack of external financing could threaten the group's ability to continue as a going concern. 
through proper budget planning, the dh group's liquidity management makes sure that sufficient 
funds  are  available.  furthermore,  an  adequate  stock  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  is  always 
maintained to ensure that operations can be financed. unused credit line are also available. as stated 
in chapter h.3, the group has a loan that includes specific financial and non-financial covenants. a 
future breach of the covenants could lead to the loan being repayable earlier than specified in the 
table below. 
the following table presents contractual (undiscounted) interest and principal payments for the dhh 
group's non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments with negative fair value 
derivative financial liabilities are only taken into account in the analysis if the contractual due date is 
required for comprehension of the timing of cash flows. the maturity is based on the contractually 
determined interest obligations of financial liabilities.

e)  market risks 
the  dh  group  generates  a  significant  portion  of  its  revenue  in  foreign  currencies  through  its 
international subsidiaries. in order to reduce foreign exchange risk, the dh group generally tries to 
generate income and incur expenses in the same functional currency. nevertheless, each group entity 
of the dh group is exposed to currency risk as soon as transactions are concluded and the resulting 
payment flows do not correspond to the functional currency of the respective entity. the following 
table shows the income statement effects that would result if the presented foreign currencies had 
appreciated or depreciated by 10% as of the reporting date. 
keur  dec. 31, 2014  dec. 31, 2013  jan. 01, 2013

in addition, the dh group considers itself exposed to foreign exchange risk through its investment in 
international subsidiaries when translating net assets. however, this translation risk is not defined as a 
foreign exchange rate by ifrs 7. 
in addition to foreign exchange risk, dhh is also exposed to interest rate risks. under ifrs 7, interest 
rate risks are presented using sensitivity analyses. this determines what the effects of a change in 
market interest rates would be on interest income and expense, trading gains and losses as well as on 
equity as of the reporting date. 
as part of sensitivity analysis, the dh group considers the effects on equity and on the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income arising from a parallel shift of the euro 
65 
 
interest rate curve by +/- 100 bps. a shift in the interest rate curve by -100 bps leads to a maximum 
reduction in the interest rate of 0.0%. the cash flow effects from the interest rate curve shift relate only 
to interest expenses or income for the next reporting period. there is only one variable rate bank loan 
in the dh group as of december 31, 2014. sensitivity analysis shows that an interest rate that is 
100 bps higher results in an increase in interest expense by keur 79; an interest rate that is 100 bps 
lower results in a decline in interest expense by keur 79.  
based on derivatives held or issued by the dh group as of the reporting date, a hypothetical change 
(quantified using sensitivity analysis) for the share values relevant to the respective instruments would 
have the following listed effects (before tax) as of the reporting date: 
financial instruments

with respect to the determined value (similar to derivatives arising from put/call options and the 
variable purchase price component), the parameter having a material impact on the measurement 
result  using  the  discounted  cash  flow  method  is  the  value  per  dhh  company  share.  as  of 
december 31, 2013, and january 1, 2013, the sensitivity analysis is as follows:

11.  advisory board 
the advisory board of dhh consists of six members. the following members were elected by the 
shareholder meeting: 
(cid:129)  lukasz gadowski, chairman 
(cid:129)  kolja hebenstreit 
(cid:129)  edward shenderovich 
(cid:129)  jeff liebermann 
(cid:129)  niklas östberg 
(cid:129)  jonathan green 
as chairman, lukasz gadowski has two votes; the other members of the advisory board each hold 
one vote. 
 
12.  subsequent events 
dhh significantly increased its equity in 2015 up to the date of preparing the 2014 consolidated 
financial statement. 
in conjunction with issuing new shares, rocket internet group ('rocket') made significant further 
contributions to the capital reserve beyond the nominal value of the new shares. this included 
keur 347,660 in cash as well as keur 206,400 in non-cash contributions. non-cash contributions 
consisted of 100% of the shares in talabat general trading and contracting company w.l.l., dubai, 
with a carrying amount of keur 150,000, and 11.36% of the shares in yemek sepeti elektronik 
iletisim tanitim pazarlama gida sanayi ve ticaret a.s. ('yemek').  
as part of acquiring the remaining 88.64% of shares in yemek, additional debt was raised in the form 
of a loan extended by the vendor (keur 121,272) and a convertible loan (keur 119,268), which was 
also granted by the vendor. the loan extended by the vendor was granted to the company at normal 
market conditions and has a term of two years.  
an additional capital increase also took place in the second quarter of 2015. this involved a cash 
capital increase by new investors totaling keur 100,568 in additional cash paid into the capital 
reserve. 
no new material financing measures were agreed besides those pertaining to the aforementioned 
period. 
in the case of the yemeksepeti group, this concerns a market leader in turkey with additional 
activities in the middle east and greece. with the acquisition of talabat shares by way of a non-cash 
contribution, control over the market leader in kuwait with a strong position in additional states in the 
middle east was also achieved. 
73 
 
as a result of the capital provision, it was possible to acquire all shares in ofd online food delivery 
services limited after the end of the reporting period, thereby strengthening the regional market 
presence in greece via the e-food platform 
these strategic acquisitions enable us to use the customer and supplier relationships along with the 
brands and domains of the acquired companies. 
provisional assessments of the paid and pending considerations are shown in the following table: 
in keur (provisional)  yemek talabat  e-food
cash share  231,116 0  10,000
vendor loan  121,272 0  0

consideration  528,056 147,127  25,413
goodwill  231,344 67,781  15,755
 
the underlying acquisition date for yemek and e-food is may 1, 2015, for talabat this is the date of 
first-time consolidation (june 1, 2015). 
due to its dominating importance, the fair value of the 'yemeksepeti' brand was calculated using the 
multi-period excess earnings method ('meem'); the value of the customer and supplier relationships 
was determined on the basis of replacement costs. the royalty relief method was used to assess the 
value  of  brands  acquired  when  purchasing  e-food  and  talabat.  the  supplier  relationship  was 
assessed using the meem approach. acquired assets are all subject to a finite useful life.  
goodwill largely includes the expected savings from synergy effects and the anticipated market growth

to the extent disclosed, the gross amount of the acquired receivables corresponds to the fair value. 
if the acquisitions were assumed already as of january 1, 2014, then the expected revenue and 
earnings contributions would be considered in the following amounts: 
in keur (provisional)  yemek talabat  e-food
revenue  20,951 5,137  726
profit/loss  1,398 1,498  -327
 
in the course of the capital increase, described above, a resolution to revoke the previous existing 
liquidity preferences was reached by the shareholders; this also had an impact on the carrying amount 
of  liabilities  for  share-based  payments.  if  the  revocation  had  already  been  assumed  as  of 
december 31, 2014, the carrying amounts to be recognized would have been keur 1,175 higher.

group management report for the 2014 financial year 
 
unless  otherwise  stated,  all  figures  have  been  rounded  to  the  nearest  eur  thousand 
(keur).  for  computational  reasons,  there  may  be  rounding  differences  to  the  exact 
mathematical values in tables and references.  
 
i.  group profile 
1.  group structure and business model 
parent company delivery hero holding gmbh (also 'delivery hero' or 'dhh') was founded in 
2011 with its registered office in berlin and has expanded its presence to local markets 
worldwide since then. following considerable acquisitions in 2014, delivery hero group's 
global  consolidation  scope  included  41  companies  as  of  the  reporting  date.  further 
information can be found in section 2c) of the economic report. 
delivery hero holding gmbh is managed by a ceo who is directly supported by four other 
executives in the area of strategy, finance, operations and information technology (in short 
'it'). management is monitored by an advisory board consisting of six members. 
delivery hero group offers online food ordering services with a presence in 30 countries on 
4 continents. this includes not only various countries in europe, latin and south america, 
but also asia and australia.  
using an internet platform, customers can choose from a variety of delivery services in their 
region and view the menus of these services. the order can be placed by app or through the 
website and subsequently paid for either in cash or using cashless means of payment. 
delivery hero generates the majority of its revenue from commission on orders. delivery 
hero offers catering establishments the option of a technical solution that allows them to 
immediately view and accept the order placed on the platform. in addition, delivery hero 
offers products and services such as food packaging as well as advertising and printing 
services for catering establishments in certain markets.  
2.  research and development 
the  majority  of  the  staff  in  the  it  division  work  not  only  on  ensuring  that  orders  are 
processed smoothly, but also on further developing the ordering platforms that are used by 
delivery hero group in the respective sales markets. these platforms represent the core 
resource for generating revenue at delivery hero group.  
research and development in this division focuses on providing the user with a comfortable, 
reliable and secure ordering platform. in addition, the switch towards the increased use of 
mobile applications is also to be addressed by the technology. the fact that it is difficult to 
split up the activity into maintenance, safeguarding, further and new development and also 
that the systems are constantly being improved means that it is not possible to separate the 
individual areas in quantitative terms.

the it department's total expenses equaled keur 11,846 for the group, which corresponds 
to 13% of revenue. it is currently not possible to provide an exact allocation of employee 
numbers on account of the organization of product, development, maintenance and design 
work within the it department. 
ii.  economic report 
1.  general economic conditions and industry environment 
moderate economic growth was observed in 2014 for the relevant markets in europe where 
delivery  hero  is  active.  year-on-year  gdp  growth  equaled  1.6%  in  germany,  1.0%  in 
denmark, -0.1% in finland, 2.6% in the uk, 0.3% in austria, 3.3% in poland, 2.1% in 
sweden, 2.0% in switzerland and 2.0% in the czech republic.1 on the markets outside 
europe, gdp growth fluctuated between 7.4% in china and 0.1% in argentina. however, 
other south american markets experienced a considerably sharper rise in gdp, for instance 
4.6% in colombia or 3.6% in ecuador.2 
on the markets in europe especially relevant to delivery hero group, the price-adjusted 
change in private consumer spending in 2014 compared to the prior year was between 3.3% 
in sweden and -1.8% in the czech republic as of the reporting date.3 spending by private 
households for the consumption of food services, as provided by the delivery hero group, 
also remained highly country specific. in delivery hero's european markets, spending on 
food services as a percentage of total household spending fluctuates between 9.7% in 
austria and 2.1% in poland.4 
there are often strong competitors in the regional markets, such as lieferando in germany 
or just eat in the uk, whose strategies and market penetration vary regionally within these 
countries. the market for ordering food online around the world is characterized by fierce 
competition, particularly as the target group is relatively rigid. in addition, restaurant chains 
such as domino's pizza or joey's pizza service now also offer their own online ordering 
services  for  their  respective  products.  in  some  countries,  however,  delivery  hero  has 
established and is continuing to expand a dominant position.

2.  business development 
 
a)  revenue development 
delivery  hero  continued  the  strong  growth  in  its  core  business  in  2014  as  well.  at 
keur 88,008 (py: keur 41,662), sales revenue in the reporting period more than doubled.  
besides  the  sharply  rising  number  of  restaurants  and  new  users,  revenue  growth  was 
primarily driven by external acquisitions. comparability of especially the results of operations 
with  the  prior  year  is  therefore  limited.  the  companies  acquired  were  included  only 
proportionately in consolidation in 2014.  
the following overview shows the proportionate annual revenue acquired within the scope of 
the first-time consolidation of these companies/groups: 
first-time 
consolidation  company  keur
     
jan. 1, 2014  9cookies gmbh  131
feb. 1, 2014  pedidosya group  2,279
aug. 1, 2014  clickdelivery group  530
aug. 1, 2014  pizza.de group  12,387
dec. 1, 2014  baedaltong co. ltd (kor)  626
total    15,953
 
the  chinese  and  czech  companies  were  consolidated  for  the  first  time  as  of 
december 31, 2014, and thus not included in the above overview.  
b)  financing measures 
in 2014, as part of various funding rounds, delivery hero was able to secure investor funds 
in the form of increases in capital. in total, delivery hero received keur 303,477 in liquid 
fund. 
this broader equity base supports both the operating activities of delivery hero and its 
growth through acquisitions. furthermore, keur 100,000 was borrowed in order to acquire 
shares. the loan is subject to fixed interest and repayment rates as well as in exchange for 
the  additional  issuance  of  so-called  warrant  and  cover  shares,  and  is  scheduled  for 
repayment by 2017. dhh can unilaterally terminate the loan at any time. the warrants were 
exercised in 2014. 
c)  acquisitions 
in the 2014 reporting period, considerable investments were made by acquiring the following 
companies: 
(cid:129)  9cookies gmbh, berlin, germany 
(cid:129)  pedidosya s.a., montevideo, uruguay, and subsidiaries 
3 
 
(cid:129)  inversiones cmr s.a.s., bogota, colombia, and subsidiaries (clickdelivery group) 
(cid:129)  pizza.de gmbh, brunswick, germany, and subsidiaries 
(cid:129)  e-aggregator s.r.o., prague, czech republic 
(cid:129)  pizzatime s.r.o., prague, slovakia 
(cid:129)  baedaltong co. ltd., seoul, korea  
(cid:129)  shanghai ai can business consulting company limited, peking, china, and 
subsidiaries 
the equity and debt capital received in 2014 were mainly used to acquire delivery hero's 
biggest german competitor to date: pizza.de group. 
the acquisition of pizza.de group significantly affected the group's net assets, financial 
position and result of operations. acquisition-driven and organic growth led to a threefold 
increase in the group's monthly order and user figures in germany and, consequently, 
almost the same rise in monthly sales within germany. pizza.de group has been profitable 
for some time and has generated stable ebitda margins in the past. this means, before 
one-time expenses, pizza.de group's positive impact is improving delivery hero group's 
financial position. the acquired intangible assets of pizza.de group led to a significant 
increase in delivery hero group's non-current assets. 
during the course of acquiring pizza.de group and in light of leveraging synergy effects, it 
was decided to close the company's location in brunswick as of august 31, 2015, and pool 
the necessary resources in berlin. those affected by this resolution were informed of this in 
late september 2014 and corresponding provisions in the amount of keur 4,585 were set 
up for severance payments and long-term agreements, which no longer have any value in 
use in the books. 
the pedidosya and clickdelivery groups operate food ordering platforms in central and 
south america. the acquisitions were guided by strategic considerations to rapidly occupy 
this as yet unclaimed territory and to achieve market dominance. management considers the 
future market potential of the central and south american region to be substantial. however, 
both companies are currently still insignificant to the group's net assets, financial position 
and result of operations as a whole on account of their small size. 
in addition, delivery hero was able to achieve a leading market position in asia, also by 
purchasing baedaltong co. ltd. in south korea. baedaltong introduced the first-ever 'click-to-
call' application in 2010, which has since been downloaded by more than 11 million users. 
furthermore, baedaltong has an extensive restaurant database that will be of strategic 
importance. 
delivery  hero's  global  expansion  and  growth  strategy  is  characterized  by  additional 
acquisitions in europe. accordingly, the company purchased e-aggregator and pizzatime in 
the  czech  republic  and  slovakia,  thereby  further  expanding  our  continental  european 
market leadership. 
4 
 
by contrast, the focus of 9cookies gmbh acquisition was on the technology factor. with 
9cookies as a partner, delivery hero intends to further perfect its ordering systems and to 
provide its customers with even more useful equipment. as 9cookies was still a young 
company at the time of the acquisition, there was no direct significant effect on the group's 
net assets, financial position and result of operations at first. 
d)  business development 
the high increases in both new users and restaurants are due to the success of marketing 
and sales activities that were stepped up in the financial year. in addition to conventional 
advertising, such as tv commercials and online advertising, marketing collaborations are 
being increasingly used to position the brands in the public eye. the uniform presence under 
a global brand has also been expanded in this context. 
especially organization and administration at delivery hero were once again improved in the 
financial year under review. as part of the rapid growth of the local operating companies, 
back office and the it department were expanded to create structures for further growth from 
operations. in addition, processes were analyzed in the local companies to identify their 
potential for optimization.  
investments in outstanding customer service were made around the world. thus, customer 
service by german subsidiary lieferheld gmbh was tüv-certified already in 2013 with a 
rating of 1.9.  
in management's opinion, business development progressed favorably in view of the strong 
sales growth in 2014. management feels that positive operating development confirms that 
delivery hero group's services represent an attractive product worldwide for which there is 
still strong demand potential. 
3.  employee development 
average headcount increased from 547 employees in 2013 to 1,018 employees in 2014. in 
addition, the average number of freelancers rose from 33 in 2013 to 56 in 2014.  
the following is an overview by function: 
function  2014 2013 change
 
sales  482 233 249
marketing  182 111 71
it  207 105 102
management  40 28 12
office administration  107 70 37
  1,018 547 471
freelancers  56 33 23
  1,074 580 494
5 
 
the reason for this increase is strong expansion of the operating activities throughout the 
group. this trend is also expected to continue in 2015. 
skilled and motivated employees represent one of the most important resources for delivery 
hero group. at the same time, delivery hero group, like so many other companies, is being 
affected by a shortage of qualified employees. for that reason, some companies in delivery 
hero group are conducting active applicant management with their own specialized staff, 
especially on various online networks (xing, linkedin, facebook), but also at trade fairs or 
at gründerszene.de, which specializes in start-up and e-commerce companies. external 
personnel services providers are used when necessary. employees of delivery hero group 
are  supported  in  their  continuing  and  further  education  at  german  subsidiary 
lieferheld gmbh  through  an  in-house  leadership  academy  by  training  programs  for 
executives or approved evening courses. 
 
4.  earnings and financial position 
a)  results of operations 
the group's results of operations are presented below in a condensed statement of profit 
and loss and other comprehensive income:

loss 
delivery hero group's revenue rose by keur 46,346 in the reporting period. growth was 
driven heavily by external acquisitions combined with organic growth. thus, sales growth 
6 
 
was achieved thanks to a significant increase in the number of food orders on the online 
platforms. the number of orders climbed from 16.1 million to 39.5 million. in addition, the 
number of users on internet platforms increased significantly. since online platforms were 
initially  launched,  the  total  number  of  active  users  has  risen  from  7.1 million  in 
december 2012 to more than 17.7 million in december 2014.  
cost of sales rose sub-proportionately to sales revenue by keur 8,050 because these costs 
are  in  part  fixed  costs.  credit  card  costs,  the  cost  for  the  call  center  and  written-off 
receivables increased largely due to transaction volumes. 
the rise in other operating income is mainly due to higher income from currency translation 
and the reversal of a loan written down in the prior year. 
stepped-up market penetration activities drove up marketing expenses disproportionately by 
keur 44,790. the biggest driver behind this development were expenses for tv and radio 
advertising, personnel expenses, costs for optimizing the customer's internet searches and 
other advertising and marketing measures. 
it expenses rose mainly due to building up personnel resources as part of the group's 
growth. 
administrative  expenses  also  increased  significantly  due  to  group  expansion  by 
keur 36,573. in this regard, especially the expenses for personnel, auditing and consulting, 
rent, leasing and office operations were felt.  
other  operating  expenses  mainly  included  losses  from  currency  conversion  and  were 
roughly at the level of the prior year. 
negative ebitda increased by 172%. as part of the ongoing growth strategy, the group is 
continuing to invest significantly in its marketing and recruitment strategy. due to operating 
expenses that rose disproportionately because of build-up activities, the ebitda margin 
deteriorated further from -62% to -80%. 
depreciation and amortization primarily included the amortization of intangibles assets, such 
as  rights,  licenses,  brands  and  customer  relationships,  as  well  as  the  depreciation  of 
property, plant and equipment. the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses 
resulted mainly from higher amortization of intangible assets acquired within the course of 
the company acquisitions in 2014.  
the change in negative net finance costs by keur 4,876 resulted largely from the greater 
volume of interest-bearing loans, which lead to higher interest expenses. 
the income tax balance rose by keur 5,189 to keur 5,555 mainly due to deferred tax 
assets. 
   
7 
 
b)  financial position 
the group's financial position is shown using the condensed statement of cash flows below: 
keur  2014 2013
cash and cash equivalents at beginning of 
9,286 9,459
financial year 
cash flows from operating activities  -54,518 -22,050
cash flows from investing activities  -302,638 -3,118
cash flows from financing activities  380,662 25,184
effect of exchange rate movements on cash 
37 -190
and cash equivalents 
net increase/decrease in cash and cash 
23,506 17
equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents at end of 
32,829 9,286
financial year 
 
the negative cash flow from operating activities predominantly resulted from the net loss for 
the  period.  the  increase  in  trade  receivables  and  other  assets  especially  reflects  the 
company's growth. 
the  cash  flow  from  investing  activities  essentially  included  shares  purchased  and 
investments in intangible fixed assets, mainly software. on account of its business model, 
the group generally has relatively minor investing activities as only a minor amount of capital 
is tied up in fixed assets. internally generated intangible assets are not capitalized. 
the cash flow from financing activities reflects the cash increase in equity in 2014. there 
was also further borrowing in 2014. both help to shore up delivery hero's operating activities. 
more information on financing measures is included in section 2 (business development). 
the group is a very broad international enterprise, present in asia, europe and south 
america, and offers online food ordering services for the various countries in these regions; 
nevertheless, it has not yet achieved break-even. 
management sees major growth potential in the development of markets for online food 
ordering services. however, the group must still bear further start-up costs. for this reason, 
the group anticipates a loss in the double-digit millions for 2015. according to the available 
forecasts, break-even for ebitda results will be achieved in 2016. 
8 
 
in 2014, the solvency of the parent company and the subsidiaries was ensured, in particular, 
through payments received from shareholders in the course of capital increases and the 
issuance  of  convertible  notes.  management  expects  that  the  shareholders  and  other 
potential investors will provide the funds necessary for the parent company, the affected 
subsidiaries and, thus, the group to continue as a going concern until their financial position 
has stabilized, and has therefore prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis. 
overall, continuation of the parent company, its subsidiaries and the group as a going 
concern is therefore dependent on implementing further measures to secure capital and 
liquidity by the shareholders or additional potential investors. furthermore, recoverability of 
the reported carrying amounts for goodwill are dependent on realization of the revenue and 
ebitda growth assumed in the budget. 
as of december 31, 2014, there were unutilized credit facilities from third parties in the 
amount of keur 200. with the exception of the loan taken out to acquire pizza.de group, 
the company is generally equity financed.  
as of the reporting date, there were no other key financial obligations that could have a 
material impact on the net assets, financial position and results of operations.  
the liquid resources reported under cash and cash equivalents were not subject to any 
material constraints on disposal as of the reporting date. local exchange controls in china 
and argentina mean the transfer of capital to other countries can be restricted. 
the majority of liabilities and provisions is due within one to five years; only keur 64,096 is 
due in the following year. 
 
c)  net assets 
the net asset position is illustrated using a condensed statement of financial position: 
assets  dec. 31, 2014  dec. 31, 2013  change
non-current assets  467,828  90%  86,738  77%  381,090

other current liabilities  10,110  2%  6,364  6%  3,745
total equity & liabilities  517,784  100%  111,991  100%  405,790
 
driven by acquisitions, delivery hero holding group's gross assets rose significantly by 
keur 405,790. of the additional assets, 57% was financed using own resources and 35% 
through long-term debt.  
the situation of gross assets being predominantly made up of non-current assets remained 
unchanged. these are mainly intangible assets by a significant margin. essential intangible 
assets as of the reporting date included keur 240,712 in goodwill, keur 147,564 in brands 
and keur 74,041 in customer and supplier relationships. investments made in property, 
plant and equipment amounted to keur 2,507 in 2014. 
the marked increase in current receivables in 2014 was largely due to growth in operating 
activities.  
the year-on-year increase in liquid funds by keur 23,543 was due to corporate actions 
(subsequently explained in this report) following acquisition-related cash outflows. 
the liabilities side of the statement of financial position consists mainly of non-current debt. 
current financial funds equaled only 12%.  
equity increased in 2014 mainly due to the 10 sequential equity measures in the amount of 
keur 314,932 (subscribed capital and capital reserves), which were offset by the total 
comprehensive loss of keur 88,160. the equity ratio increased accordingly from 35% to 
52%. of equity, keur -524 was applicable to non-controlling interests as of the reporting 
date. 
the year-on-year increase in other non-current provisions in 2014 by keur 12,439 was 
mainly due to a new long-term incentive program for employees initiated in 2013 and similar 
programs in place since 2011. in particular, the rising enterprise value is leading to increases 
in the provision for employee claims from these programs. 
as of the reporting date, keur 55,772 in non-current liabilities mainly included deferred tax 
liabilities, which was largely attributable to the intangible assets acquired during the course of 
the company purchases. 
the keur 86,202 increase in non-current trade and other payables was predominantly due 
to financial loans, which were extended during the course of the acquisitions. 
other current provisions increased by keur 4,585 largely due to accruing for restructuring 
expenses to be incurred as part of integrating a subsidiary acquired during the reporting 
period.  
10 
 
the rise in current trade and other payables is the result of both an increase in operating 
activities and a rise in commitments relating to financial derivatives.  
other current liabilities mainly included obligations vis-à-vis staff, other taxes and charges as 
well as from advance payments received. 
management rates the overall net assets, financial position and result of operations as 
positive or – in view of the major expansion carried out during the reporting period – as 
expected. even though the group continued to generate significant losses, these are within 
the scope of what was expected and budgeted for in light of the acquisitions and, in some 
cases,  related  to  fundamental  business  start-up  work.  there  were  substantial  equity 
resources as of the reporting date. in addition, individual companies already made a positive 
contribution to consolidated earnings in 2014. 
 
5.  financial and non-financial performance indicators 
the most significant financial performance indicator for delivery hero is sales revenue. this 
reflects the capacity to sell services in the market and makes it possible to determine the 
group's competitive position. more information on the revenue structure can be found in the 
ifrs notes to the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 
in the non-financial area, the most important indicators are the number of orders per financial 
year and the total number of users on the online platforms: 
(cid:129)  number of orders: this performance indicator tracks orders placed by end-customers. 
the delivery hero group generates a majority of sales from orders placed on online 
platforms; therefore, this figure makes it possible to measure customer acceptance of 
the service. conclusions can also be drawn about the effect of advertising activities 
so that these can be adjusted accordingly. 
(cid:129)  total number of users: total number of email addresses, consisting of previously 
unknown email addresses (new customers) and already existing email addresses 
(existing customers). at the same time, this figure represents the customer base. in 
addition to growth from operations, this figure provides information on the churn rate.

iii.  subsequent events 
dhh  significantly  increased  its  equity  in  2015  up  to  the  date  of  drawing  up  the  2014 
consolidated financial statement. 
in conjunction with issuing new shares, rocket internet group ('rocket') made significant 
contributions  to  the  capital  reserve  beyond  the  nominal  value  of  the  new  shares.  this 
included both keur 347,660 in cash as well as keur 206,400 in non-cash contributions. 
the  non-cash  contributions  included  all  of  the  shares  in  talabat  general  trading  and 
contracting company w.l.l., dubai, with a carrying value of keur 150,000, and 11.36% of 
the  shares  in  yemek  sepeti  elektronik  iletisim  tanitim  pazarlama  gida  sanayi  ve 
ticaret a.s. ('yemek' or 'yemek sepeti'). 
as part of acquiring the remaining 88.64% of shares in yemek sepeti, additional debt was 
raised in the form of a loan extended by the seller (keur 121,272) and a convertible loan 
(keur 119,268), which was also granted by the seller. the loan extended by the seller was 
granted to the company at normal market conditions and has a term of two years. no new 
material financing measures were agreed besides those pertaining to the aforementioned 
period. 
yemek sepeti was established some 15 years ago and works in turkey together with 9,400 
restaurants in 63 cities. the company has approx. 1.2 million (registered) users in turkey 
and annually processes approx. 25.1 million orders for restaurants or supply services, which 
corresponds to a market share of over 90% in terms of the number of internet orders for 
food.  due  to  the  major  growth  potential  in  turkey's  e-commerce  sector,  management 
expects this company to make a significantly positive contribution to delivery hero's earnings 
position. in addition to its home market turkey, yemek sepeti is active also especially in the 
middle east and operates further ordering platforms in the uae, saudi arabia, lebanon, 
oman,  qatar  and  jordan.  yemek  sepeti's  middle  east  business  supplements  delivery 
hero's already strong position in this region, driven by its subsidiary talabat, which was also 
acquired in march 2015. management believes that the synergies in these markets will also 
help shore up the value of these new partnerships.  
as a result of the capital provision, it was possible to acquire all shares in ofd online food 
delivery services limited ('e-food.gr' or 'e-food') in greece after the end of the reporting 
period, thereby strengthening the regional market presence there. e-food.gr is the market 
leader in greece, which each month processes more than 300,000 orders in 40 greek cities. 
the strategic acquisitions enable us to use the customer and supplier relationships along 
with the brands and domains of the acquired companies. 
preliminary  assessments  of  the  paid  and  impending  considerations  are  shown  in  the 
subsequent table. considerations subsumed under the item 'other' do not include any cash 
components. 
an additional capital increase also took place in q2 2015. this involved a cash capital 
increase by new investors totaling keur 100,568 in additional cash paid into the capital 
reserve.

the underlying acquisition date for yemek and e-food is may 1, 2015, for talabat this is the 
date of first-time consolidated (june 1, 2015). 
due to its dominating importance, the fair value of the 'yemek sepeti' brand was calculated 
using the multi-period excess earnings method; the value of the customer and supplier 
relationships was determined on the basis of replacement costs. the royalty relief method 
was used to assess the value of brands acquired when purchasing e-food and talabat. the 
supplier relationship was assessed using the mpeem approach. acquired assets are all 
subject to a finite useful life.  
goodwill irrelevant for tax purposes largely includes the expected savings from synergy 
effects and the anticipated market growth potential. 
to the extent disclosed, the gross amount of the acquired receivables corresponds to the fair 
value.

iv.  forecast, opportunities and risks 
1.  forecast 
the global economy is expected to see an increase in gross domestic product of 3.7% in 
2015 (after 1.6% in 2014).5 positive global economic development will continue to be largely 
driven  by  the  developing  and  emerging  markets.  however,  there  are  indications  of  a 
slowdown  in  expansion  in  the  coming  years.  in  contrast,  economic  expansion  in  the 
advanced economies will pick up speed over the next two years.6 
the global market for food delivery grew 3.3% in 2014. this growth is expected to intensify in 
the future. internationally-recognized market research companies, such as infiniti research 
limited or technavio, are predicting average market growth of 4% from 2015 to 2018. a key 
driver of this development is increasing urbanization combined with greater time pressure, 
leaving less time and space to prepare and eat meals. in addition, the expected disposable 
income worldwide and rising global gdp will further fuel the market for food deliveries. the 
global market for food delivery services is currently equally distributed across europe, the 
middle east and africa (37-39%), america (36-38%) and asia-pacific (23-25%). with a global 
market share of 30%, the us has the lion's share of the overall market. a sub-segment of the 
market for food delivery services is the market for internet food delivery services, which 
involves orders being placed online via dedicated ordering platforms. considerably higher 
growth rates can be expected for this relatively young market segment compared to the 
traditional delivery market involving phone orders. increasing global internet penetration is 
also driving the growth of internet food delivery services. market studies are predicting 5.6% 
in average annual growth of internet users between 2015 and 2018. 
therefore,  delivery  hero  group's  management  predicts  that  both  the  total  number  of 
platform users and the number of orders will increase sharply in 2015. we expect a sharp 
rise in the total number of platform users and orders. this rise will also be aided in 2015 by 
intensive marketing activities and further acquisitions. the customer base of delivery hero 
companies is therefore set to expand further, while the sustainable use of the ordering 
platform by existing customers increases. in the context of these measures, management is 
anticipating a jump in sales for the 2015 financial year. due to the effects of full-year 
consolidation of the companies acquired in 2014 and the companies acquired in the course 
of  2015,  management  expects  –  without  further  organic  growth  –  revenue  growth  of 
keur 56,956.  simultaneously,  management  assumes  that  continuation  of  the  growth 
strategy will lead to ebitda declining further. furthermore, higher scheduled amortization of

the intangible assets identified in the 2014 purchase price allocations, which will have a full-
year effect for the first time, and the first-time amortization of the preliminary purchase price 
allocations in 2015 (refer to 'subsequent events, iii.') will lead to a material drop in annual 
earnings.  however,  the  key  financial  performance  indicator  for  the  group  is  still  sales 
revenue that reflects the capacity to sell services in the market and makes it possible to 
determine the group's competitive position. delivery hero group's management predicted a 
total number of platform users between 16 million and 17 million and a number of orders 
between 35 million and 40 million for the 2014 financial year. in actuality, the total number of 
platform users and orders was 17.7 million and 39.5 million, respectively, in 2014. moreover, 
revenue of between keur 85,000 to keur 95,000 was expected. the keur 88,008 in 
revenue generated in 2014 was roughly in the middle of the estimated range. 
these  forecasts  are  also  reflected  in  the  planning  for  the  2015  financial  year,  key 
assumptions for which are the development of sales, the total number of platform users and 
the number of orders. 
assumptions regarding the economic development of the market and the industry are based 
on estimates that the management of delivery hero group currently considers realistic 
based on the information available. however, these estimates are subject to uncertainty and 
entail the unavoidable risk that forecast developments will not actually occur, either in terms 
of their trend or extent. the forecast is based on the composition of the group in the forecast 
period as known at the time of planning. 
the activities of delivery hero are subject to various risks presented in the risk report. 
measures have been introduced as far as possible to protect against current and potential 
risks. delivery hero's market position should improve further over the medium term. 
management is currently not aware of any special circumstances following the forecast 
period of one year, which can impact the group's financial position.

2.  risks 
the risk report addresses business risks that faced delivery hero group in the 2014 financial 
year or as of the reporting date, and covers a period of at least one year.  
the risks presented below are set out in order of their impact on the group. 
despite strong sales growth, delivery hero group remains dependent on external financing. 
for that reason, turbulence on the financial markets could have a negative impact on the 
financing options of delivery hero holding gmbh, which finances operations. unanswered 
questions  on  the  economic  and  institutional  stability  of  the  euro  zone,  the  expansive 
monetary  policy  of  the  major  note-issuing  banks  worldwide  and  the  unresolved  debt 
problems in numerous industrial and developing countries continue to hold significant risk 
factors. management estimates the risks potentially affecting the company's business from 
the current political situation in greece as being low. however, potential hyperinflation in 
argentina represents a substantial risk to business activities there. 
delivery hero holding gmbh was able to secure a considerable amount of finance in 2014 in 
the context of capital increases, which will enabled the business activities of the operating 
subsidiaries to be financed in 2014. in addition, there are unutilized committed credit lines 
both at the level of delivery hero holding gmbh and at the level of the subsidiaries.  
the ability of the parent company, subsidiaries and group to continue as a going concern 
will depend on the implementation of further measures to secure capital and liquidity by the 
shareholders  in  the  parent  company  or  potential  investors.  we  also  refer  here  to  the 
statements in section 4. b). 
to generate sales, delivery hero essentially relies on the functionality, security and stability 
of various websites, in particular the online ordering platforms. outages and disruptions 
would lead immediately to a loss of sales and would also damage the company's reputation 
in the medium term. especially the many new technologically advanced platforms represent 
a  risk.  given  the  nature  of  these  sensitive  systems,  even  small  changes  can  trigger 
considerable effects in terms of error rates or even shutdowns. best practice processes are 
being implemented to an increasing extent in order to prevent damage. in addition, internal 
controls  and  our  staff's  it  know-how  are  constantly  being  expanded.  the  software, 
developed in-house, is tested as part of a quality assurance process before it is released. to 
defend  against  external  attacks,  external  service  providers  and  redundant  systems  are 
employed, among other things, while load tests are run on a regular basis. as part of an 
incident management process, systematic searches for the causes of disruptions are carried 
out and measures are developed to permanently eliminate these. 
delivery hero group works on a global basis and is subject to the local laws and regulations 
of  the  countries  in  which  it  operates.  the  operating  activities  of  the  respective  local 
subsidiaries could be affected by changes in the existing legal framework. furthermore, there 
are  tax  risks  that  may  arise  and  can  impact  the  financial  situation  of  the  companies. 
following assessment of the respective probabilities of occurrence, provisions were set up 
for tax risks recognized as liabilities as of the reporting date. the actual utilization of these 
provisions will depend on whether and to what extent the risks materialize. 
risks for delivery hero group include ongoing legal disputes resulting from the group's 
operating activity. after assessing the respective probabilities of occurrence, provisions were 
16 
 
set up for pending legal disputes as of the reporting date. the actual utilization of these 
provisions will depend on whether and to what extent the risks materialize. the amount of 
the provisions for legal disputes is of minor importance.  
there is the risk of default for individual claims; for example, in the event of the customer's 
total or partial default. this default risk is minimized by checking the amount of outstanding 
receivables before a new order is accepted by the sales department and by offsetting against 
the  cash  collected  for  the  customer.  these  measures  are  employed  in  an  attempt  to 
effectively manage and, where possible, reduce bad debts. management assesses the risk 
of defaulting debtors as being negligible and intends to push further professionalization of the 
debt collection system. 
also due to low barriers to market entry, the economic environment remains characterized by 
fierce competition. in addition, restaurant chains such as domino's pizza or joey's pizza 
service also offer their own online ordering services for their respective products. delivery 
hero group's objective is to offer end customers the best purchasing experience worldwide, 
with the greatest comfort and widest selection, and thereby stand out from the competition. 
as a consequence, management assumes that the group will continue to successfully hold 
its own on the market despite stiff competition. as delivery hero group was among the first 
market  entrants  in  many  markets,  the  risk  of  it  being  squeezed  out  of  the  market  by 
competitors is assessed as being relatively low. 
risks also arise for the group from fraud in the use of diverse payment options (fraud and 
fake). ordering activities are monitored as part of a fraud and fake management system in 
order to be able to identify and prevent cases of fraud. in addition, intensified efforts are 
being made by the operating units to outsource the risk of fraud. at the german subsidiary 
lieferheld gmbh, for example, the risk resulting from fraud in the use of payment options 
was assumed from mid-2014 by the catering establishments because, in accordance with the 
general terms and conditions of business of lieferheld gmbh, they themselves have to be 
liable for any damages incurred. for the above reasons, delivery hero group's management 
assesses the risks from fraud and fake to be minor. 
delivery hero group faces risks from both external developments and internal company 
processes. weakening consumer spending in private households could have a negative 
impact on the group's sales. however, in view of the cautiously positive forecasts for the 
global  economy  in  2015,  management  assesses  the  risk  of  a  downturn  in  consumer 
spending to be low. 
in summary, delivery hero group faces a heightened risk that is common to start-ups. the 
break-even point for the group has not yet been achieved, with the result that it relies on 
external financing. as there continues to be considerable potential for growth, even despite 
skyrocketing sales in the past, management assumes that it will be possible to draw upon 
external financing options until break-even is reached. it sees itself confirmed in this opinion 
by the extremely successful capital increases at delivery hero holding gmbh in 2014 and 
early 2015. 
17 
 
3.  opportunities 
opportunities include business opportunities that present themselves to delivery hero group 
during the year after the reporting date.  
the opportunities presented below are set out in order of their impact on the group. 
in the field of catering, the home delivery market is regarded along with takeaway as a trend 
with higher than average growth rates. this is true both for developed markets such as 
germany and for emerging countries in latin america, asia-pacific and the middle east. 
thanks to rigorously aligning the business model with the needs of the customer within a 
growth market, the opportunity to realize increasing sales continues to present itself to 
delivery hero group. the company intends to further raise its brand recognition globally 
through  selective  marketing  campaigns,  sponsorship  and  discount  programs.  these 
marketing activities combined with the best purchasing experience are designed to win over 
new customers and increase the loyalty of existing customers. 
additional synergies can be realized through the joint use of the online platform by multiple 
companies of delivery hero group. an ordering platform is to be progressively developed 
and maintained centrally and filled with local content by the individual companies. by sharing 
the expenses incurred in the development and maintenance of the platform between the 
individual participating companies of delivery hero group, the expenditure for the national 
subsidiaries will be reduced, an approach that represents a clear competitive edge over 
competitors that do not have a similar platform system.  
synergies also result from the joint use of marketing measures and the global exchange of 
ideas, to the extent that cultural differences in individual regions do not work against this.  
delivery hero can also create potential from exchanges within the group between the local 
subsidiaries. as a result of this exchange of ideas, delivery hero can identify global trends in 
the business early on and react promptly. the group's acquisitions in central and south 
america not only expand the options for internal group exchanges, but also provide new 
drive for innovation. 
additional significant strategic potential can be tapped by further optimizing the liquidity and 
cash  flows  of  the  parties  involved  in  the  order  process  by  integrating  digital  payment 
systems. this approach must first overcome major administrative hurdles and regulatory 
requirements. 
delivery hero group is also responding to the trend towards the increasing use of mobile 
consumer devices, or smartphones. the delivery hero apps will be rigorously developed for 
various mobile operating systems. the group is reporting a steadily increasing number of 
orders placed by mobile consumer devices. 
delivery hero's target group is young and internet savvy. it frequently uses social networks to 
exchange  information.  delivery  hero  is  therefore  increasingly  integrating  these  types  of 
social networks. in some countries it is already possible to log in to the ordering process 
using popular social networks, which should simplify the ordering process. this will also 
further improve delivery hero's brand recognition. 
18 
 
in summary, delivery  hero has the opportunity to participate in global trends, such as 
increasing networking, the use of apps on smartphones and changing eating habits. the 
growth of the global business activities will be supported by professional structures in it and 
back office. 
v.  use of financial instruments 
1.  risk management 
 
delivery hero group believes the use of financial instruments means it faces default risks, 
liquidity risks and market risks (especially interest rate and foreign exchange risks). delivery 
hero actively monitors these risks and manages them using an effective risk management 
system. the risk management function is integrated in group controlling.  
2.  liquidity risks 
 
strong external growth means delivery hero group has to rely on external financing to 
ensure sufficient liquidity. a lack of external financing could threaten the group's ability to 
continue  as  a  going  concern.  through  proper  budget  planning,  delivery  hero  group's 
liquidity  management  makes  sure  that  sufficient  funds  are  available.  furthermore,  a 
constantly  secured  and  adequate  amount  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  ensures  that 
operations can be financed. unused credit lines are also available.  
3.  market risks 
 
through its foreign subsidiaries, delivery hero group generates a significant portion of its 
revenue in foreign currencies. in order to reduce the foreign exchange risk, delivery hero 
group  generally  tries  to  generate  income  and  incur  expenses  in  the  same  functional 
currency. in addition, delivery hero group's investments in foreign subsidiaries means it is 
exposed to foreign exchange risks when converting the value of net assets. however, this is 
not a foreign exchange risk as defined by ifrs 7.  
the credit or default risk is the risk that the business partners, mainly restaurants, are unable 
to fulfill their payment obligations, which would mean delivery hero group incurs a loss. 
such risks mainly involve current trade receivables. delivery hero group is not exposed to a 
major  default  risk  from  any  single  individual  customer.  the  concentration  of  the 
creditworthiness risk is limited due to the broad and heterogeneous customer base.  
19 
 
delivery hero group monitors the default risk and manages this actively by making any 
necessary credit checks and optimizing the payment process. consequently, the risk is 
largely transferred to the restaurants (also by way of an effective debt collection system). the 
maximum default risk corresponds to the carrying value of the financial assets.
