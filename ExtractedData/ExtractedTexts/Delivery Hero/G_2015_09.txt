a.  general disclosures concerning the consolidated financial 
statements 
01.  group profile 
delivery hero holding gmbh (hereinafter also referred to as: "dhh") is an international company, 
which together with its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively: the "dh group") provides online food 
ordering services in over 30 countries on five continents (europe, south america, north america, asia 
and australia).  
the company has its registered office at mohrenstrasse 60, 10117 berlin, and is entered in the 
commercial register of the berlin charlottenburg district court under hrb 135090. the company is 
a limited liability company in accordance with german law. 
management prepared the consolidated financial statements as of june 28, 2016, and submitted 
these directly to the shareholders for approval. 
02.  basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with ifrs 
the consolidated financial statements of the dh group have been prepared in accordance with the 
international  financial  reporting  standards  (ifrs)  adopted  and  issued  by  the  international 
accounting  standards  board  (iasb),  as  adopted  by  the  european  union.  preparation  of  the 
consolidated financial statements occurred under application of the provisions of regulation (ec) no 
1606/2002 of the european parliament and of the council of july 19, 2002, on the application of 
international accounting standards in conjunction with section 315a (3) of the german commercial 
code [hgb] taking into consideration the supplementary provisions of german commercial law. 
the consolidated financial statements comply with the classification regulations stipulated in ias 1. 
the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income has been prepared in 
accordance with the cost-of-sales method. there is a distinction between current and non-current 
assets and liabilities in the presentation of the consolidated statement of financial position. assets or 
liabilities falling due within one year are classified as current. individual items in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the statement of financial position are 
summarized to improve the clarity of the presentation. these items are explained in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements.  
the consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. unless otherwise stated, all figures 
have been rounded to the nearest eur thousand (keur). for computational reasons, there may be 
rounding differences to the exact mathematical values in tables and references.  
the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of the going concern principle which 
assumes that the group is able to meet the obligatory terms of redemption of loan liabilities, as 
specified in note c.14 (refer also to f.02.d). the continuation of delivery hero holding, its subsidiaries 
and the group as a going concern is nonetheless dependent on the implementation of further 
measures to secure capital and liquidity by the shareholders of the parent company and potential 
investors. the dh group generated a consolidated loss of keur -252,945 in the 2015 financial year 
(2014: keur -88,906). owing to the procurement of debt capital and equity, the previous loss arising 
 
1 
from operating activities will be offset again in the 2015 financial year. as of the reporting date, capital 
resources could be raised to a considerable extent from third parties (refer also to section e). as a 
consequence, management realistically expects that the group will have adequate resources to 
continue business activities for the foreseeable period. assets and liabilities are therefore principally 
measured at amortized cost. excluded from this are financial assets and liabilities that are carried at 
the fair value applicable on the reporting date. these are listed under notes g.09.a) and g.09.b). 
the consolidated financial statements and group management report are published in the german 
federal gazette [bundesanzeiger]. 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with ifrss requires management 
estimates  and  measurements.  areas  involving  a  higher  degree  of  judgment  or  areas  where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in 
note g.15. 
b.  scope of consolidation 
01.  changes in the group 
in the reporting year, the number of entities to be fully consolidated changed as follows: 
number of fully consolidated companies  2015  2014
jan. 1  40  24
additions  70  24
disposals due to sale  0  1
disposals due to merger  3  7
disposals due to liquidation  1  0
dec. 31  106  40
  
three companies were merged into other subsidiaries and one subsidiary was liquidated in 2015. 
while one subsidiary was not consolidated due to immateriality in the 2014 reporting period, all 
controlled companies were included in the scope of consolidated in the reporting year. 
in the 2015 financial year, material purchases were made as part of acquisitions, which are presented 
in detail in the section below in accordance with the requirements of ifrs 3.  
the number of equity-accounted companies developed as set forth in the following table: 
number of equity-accounted companies  2015  2014
jan. 1  0  0
additions  2  0
disposals  0  0

the dh group was able to realize a large number of acquisitions in 2015. the following table 
summarizes the cash purchase price components paid and cash and cash equivalents assumed in the 
course of company acquisitions.

02.  acquisitions 
a)  yemek sepeti group 
with the acquisition of the yemek sepeti group on may 1, 2015, a strategic investment was made in 
order to obtain comprehensive access to new customers in southeast europe. yemek sepeti operates 
restaurant portals to handle online food orders and is the market leader in turkey with further activities 
in the middle east and greece. 
in the course of the acquisition, the company acquired 
•  100% of the shares in yemek sepeti elektronik iletisim tanitim pazarlama gida sanayi ve 
ticaret a.s. (turkey), food basket elektronik i̇letişim gıda ticaret ltd. şti (turkey), the 
netherland yemek sepeti coöperatie u.a. (the netherlands), yemek sepeti bv. (dubai), 
foodonclick.com fz-llc (uae) und gulf bv. (the netherlands),  
•  76% of the shares in click delivery s.a. (greece) and ceraon bv. (the netherlands), as well 
as 
•  60% of the shares in foodonclick.com jordan private shareholding company (jordan). 
 
the shares acquired also represent voting rights. the consideration for the acquisition amounted to a 
total  of  keur 505,602.  dhh's  shares  in  luxembourg  investment  company  43  s.à r.l.  (parent 
company of yemek sepeti a.s.) and in yemek sepeti a.s. incl. all associated rights, titles, dividends 
etc. were pledged as collateral for the two loans taken out for the company acquisitions. the collateral 
applies to all existing and future debts, obligations and liabilities assumed by dhh in connection with 
the loan agreement. the pledging of shares to the lender takes priority over any other claims to the 
pledged assets. 
the transaction costs for the acquisition recognized under administrative expenses for the 2015 
financial year amounted to keur 754. 
 
3 
the acquisition costs of this business combination were allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities 
using the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date as follows: 
in keur  fair value after acquisition
intangible assets  364,103
property, plant and equipment  1,188
trade and other receivables  28,514
other assets  1,149
cash and cash equivalents  5,430
deferred tax assets  5,217
provisions and liabilities  -30,952
trade payables  -4,136
deferred tax liabilities  -72,178
net assets  298,335
consideration transferred  505,602
thereof cash consideration  231,127
thereof convertible loans  112,098
thereof vendor loans  115,634
thereof shareholder's non-cash contribution and other consideration  46,743
non-controlling interests  613
goodwill  207,880
  
goodwill, which represents mainly non-separately identifiable assets such as the positive future 
business outlook, employee expertise and the expected synergy effects arising from integration, is not 
tax-deductible. acquired intangible assets are not subject to an indefinite useful life. trade receivables 
from third parties with a gross value of keur 3,271 were acquired, of which keur 268 is probably 
uncollectible. the fair value of the trade receivables from third parties amounts to keur 3,003. 
due to its dominating importance, the fair value of the "yemeksepeti" brand was calculated using the 
multi-period excess earnings method ("meem"); the value of the customer and supplier relationships 
was determined on the basis of replacement costs. 
on account of the number and complexity of acquisitions in the 2015 financial year, the company 
retains the option of making a retroactive adjustment. key, open issues include but are not limited to 
reviewing how the brand, the fair value of consideration and deferred tax assets are measured. 
therefore, the disclosures are provisional in terms of ifrs 3.45. 
since first-time inclusion on may 1, 2015, yemek sepeti has contributed keur 21,830 to group 
revenue and a keur 3,494 loss to consolidated earnings. had yemek sepeti already been fully 
consolidated on january 1, 2015, the acquired group would have contributed keur 31,201 to group 
revenue and a keur 23,221 loss to consolidated earnings. 
b)  e-food group 
on may 1, 2015, all shares in ofd online food delivery services limited (cyprus) and online 
delivery  sa  promotion  of  internet  services  societe  anonyme  (greece)  were  acquired,  thereby 
strengthening the regional market presence in greece via the e-food platform. 
the amount determined for the consideration totaled keur 21,877 and comprises the purchase price 
paid in the reporting period of keur 10,000 and a contingent purchase price liability with a fair value 
 
4 
of keur 11,877 recognized as of the acquisition date. the contingent purchase price component 
consists of two earn-out components which are due at the respective maturity dates. the amount of 
the two components depends on the development of net revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, 
depreciation and amortization (ebitda) of the acquired companies during the earn-out periods. the 
contingent purchase price component is limited to a maximum total of keur 45,000. the following 
table shows the development of the fair values of the contingent purchase price component and the 
length of the earn-out periods.

b)  breakdown of goodwill 
we refer to the explanations in section g.05 for the general assumptions and methods for conducting 
an impairment test. 
for the purpose of testing for impairment, goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units of the 
group as follows: 
in keur  2015  2014
yemek sepeti group  193,901  0
lieferheld gmbh  68,082  68,082
pizza.de gmbh  67,299  67,299
talabat group  60,415  0
online pizza norden ab  37,965  37,965
subtotal  427,662  173,346
multiple entities without significant amounts of goodwill  91,896  67,367
total  519,558  240,712
  
the year-on-year increase in goodwill of keur 278,845 (116%) resulted mainly from the company 
acquisitions in 2015. key acquisitions included the yemek sepeti group and the talabat group (see 
company acquisitions in section b.02).  
the recoverable amount for the aforementioned cgus is based on the value in use as fair value 
cannot be reliably determined. the following assumptions were made in determining value in use: 
perpetual annuity 
wacc  ebitda margin 
in %          growth 
   2015 2014   2015 2014    2015  2014
yemek sepeti group     12.9 -   59.1 -    2.0  -
lieferheld gmbh     12.5 12.6   28.2 40.4    2.0  1.0
pizza.de gmbh     9.5 9.6   59.1 53.2    2.0  1.0
talabat group     16.3 -   64.4 -    2.0  -
online pizza norden ab     13.1 13.2   56.5 54.3    2.0  1.0
others     17.7 15.7   24.6 29.3    2.0  1.0
  
with one exception as explained in the next section, the determination of value in use for cgus led to 
a recoverable amount exceeding the carrying amounts stated above.  
derivation of the equity component of wacc is based on a uniform risk-free base rate of 0.75% for 
the  eur  area  (py: 1.75%)  and  a  cgu-specific  risk  premium  of  between  6.0%  and  29.8% 
(py: 6.8% to 22.8%). the risk premium contains adjustment components for inflation and country risk 
as well as market risk and cgu-specific premiums, which depend largely on the period of occurrence 
and are reduced as the history is extended. in addition, an entity-specific risk factor (beta factor) of 
1.29 is used across cgus. tax rates of between 15.0% and 30.8% are used dependent on the cgu. 
as part of annual impairment testing as of december 31, 2015, a sensitivity analysis was also 
conducted. in each case, an increase of the base rate by 100 bps, a proportional reduction of planned 
annual revenue growth by ten percent and an absolute reduction of the planned ebitda margin by 
five percent was assumed for this. none of these adjustments led to a need for a write-down.

c)  impairment test for intangible assets 
the impairment loss on goodwill of keur 2,089 determined in the reporting period related to the cash 
generating  unit  of  the  operating  segment  of  the  china  group.  the  impairment  was  due  to  the 
unfavorable economic outlook in the segment concerned as determined by management. the value in 
use of the china group as determined in line with these findings also resulted in impairment of 
intangible assets (trademarks) of keur 4,194 and the customer/supplier relationships of keur 2,136. 
the value in use was determined by applying the discount rate before taxes of 34.7% and a steady 
growth rate of two percent from 2025.

the increase in the carrying amount for operating and office equipment is based on an increase in 
purchasing driven by strong growth of operations as well as additions due to acquisitions. for 
acquisitions in the financial year, please refer also to section b.02. advance payments in 2015 
resulted from the reconstruction of a rented office space to be used in the future. 
as in the prior year, impairment losses were recognized on leasehold improvements in 2015 relating 
primarily to the relocation of operating activities of a dh entity. 
operating and office equipment includes facilities leased by the group to third parties as short-term 
operating leases that can be terminated at short notice: these facilities have the following carrying 
amounts: 
dec. 31,  dec. 31,

the majority of trade and other receivables is current; trade receivables as well as other receivables

termination option which was separated from a vendor loan taken out in 2015. the derivative related 
to a level 3 instrument. other receivables relate mainly to receivables from payment service providers.

total after offsetting  9,483 138,671 720  55,772
  
the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities between the years 2014 and 2015 mainly results from 
the acquisition of companies in 2015 and the related recognition of deferred tax liabilities on the 
hidden reserves disclosed. 
the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities results from the effects, presented below; in the 
process, recognition of the change directly in equity does not apply. the share of deferred taxes 
recorded directly in equity resulted mainly from deferred taxes on equity components of loans granted 
and the associated derivatives.

the subscribed capital of the company was increased in 2015 by keur 139 through the issue of a 
total of 139,182 shares in the course of ten capital measures. the subscribed capital of dhh as of 
december 31, 2015, was keur 394 and was fully paid in.

by  shareholder  resolution,  management  is  authorized  to  increase  the  authorized  capital  of  the 
company within five years after entry into the commercial register by issuing new shares against 
cash contributions, on one or several occasions, by a total not exceeding eur 1,601 ("authorized

22 
 
c)  capital reserves 
dhh's capital reserves increased by keur 781,289 in the reporting year; this is mainly attributable to 
the following circumstances: 
an increase in capital reserves of keur 779,667 resulted from premiums paid in the course of the 
aforementioned ten capital increases.  
in addition, there was an increase in capital reserves of keur 4,435 in connection with a share-based 
payment agreement (for details on ifrs 2 see section f.01.c)).  
in addition, capital reserves increased by keur 3,426 due to the equity component of a loan and the 
deferred tax liability in part attributed to this. the change in capital reserves consists of the increase 
due to the equity component of the loan amounting to keur 4,907 and the reduction due to the 
deferred tax liability amounting to keur 1,481. in addition to interest and principal payments, this loan 
also grants lenders regular distributions of dhh shares (cover shares).  
a reduction in the capital reserve by keur 6,611 (2014: keur 1,297) results from transactions with 
companies with non-controlling shares in equity.  
d)  revenue and other reserves 
as in the prior year, revenue reserves and other reserves of the group consists of the revaluation 
reserve from the first-time adoption, the profit/loss carryforward at the beginning of the period, the loss 
in the reporting period as well as other comprehensive income.

the separate financial statements of international subsidiaries recognized directly in equity as well as 
effects from the remeasurement of net defined benefit liabilities in 2015. the increase in currency 
differences in 2015 resulted mainly from the depreciation of the turkish lira against the euro in the 
reporting year. the following table shows the effects:

for the 2016 financial year, pension payments of keur 236 are expected. 
13.  other provisions 
the increase in other provisions in 2015 primarily results from the addition of the provision for share-
based payment. share-based payment is discussed separately in section f.01. of the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements. the addition to provisions for personnel is based on obligations to 
employees of a newly acquired company. this program was settled according to plan until july 2017, 
a share of the provision was already utilized in 2015. there are significant uncertainties regarding the 
amount of the outflow. 
the restructuring provisions mainly concern obligations arising from the relocation of premises and 
personnel restructuring at one dh entity. a share of the provision was already utilized in 2015. there 
are significant uncertainties in respect of the extent and due date of outflows; restructuring of this 
entity is expected to be completed in 2016.  
in addition, the dh group is exposed to further business risks, which however do not allow for any 
reasonable assessment to be made due to their type and very low probability of occurrence. for 
practical reasons, no disclosures on contingent liabilities and receivables are made in accordance with 
ias 37.91. 
the following table shows the development of other provisions and their breakdown by maturity date.

the maturity of trade payables and other liabilities is broken down, as indicated above. non-current 
trade payments and other liabilities mainly relate to other loans, liabilities from derivative financial 
instruments and vendor loans. 
the increase in vendor loans is due to the taking out of a vendor loan in the course of the yemek 
sepeti transaction with a carrying amount as of december 31, 2015, of keur 128.808. the vendor 
loan  includes  a  termination  option  on  the  part  of  delivery  hero,  which  represents  a  separable 
embedded derivative and which was separated upon taking out the loan from the base contract. the 
termination option had a market value of keur 2,892 as of december 31, 2015, and is recorded 
under trade and other receivables. 
the other loans related mainly to a new loan taken out in 2015 with a nominal value of keur 90,000, 
which has a carrying amount of keur 74,063 as of december 31, 2015, and a loan already taken out 
in 2014 with a nominal value of keur 100,000 and a carrying amount of keur 84,660 as of 
december 31,  2015  (december 31,  2014:  keur 92.868).  the  loan  with  a  nominal  value  of 
keur 100,000 was restructured twice in 2015. both restructurings led to a disposal of the existing 
liability and re-recognition of the restructured loan at fair value. both the restructured loan and the new 
loan taken out are hybrid financial instruments pursuant to ias 32.28, containing both equity and debt 
components. the debt component of both loans was determined in the course of initial recognition as 
present  value  of  future  interest  and  principal  payments.  subsequent  measurement  occurs  at 
amortized cost. the equity component is calculated using the residual value method as the difference 
between the fair value of the entire instrument and the fair value of the debt component taking into 
account all separable derivatives embedded in the loan agreement. the agreement stipulates that 
both loans are to be repaid by mid-2018. 
both loan agreements include several embedded derivatives, each of which is to be treated as a 
compound  derivative  in  accordance  with  ias 39.ag29  and  stated  at  fair  value.  the  embedded 
derivatives relate to stock interest, i.e. the supply of shares in lieu of interest payments, and special 
termination rights. the market value of the embedded derivatives from both loan agreements amounts 
to keur 19,267 as of december 31, 2015 (december 31, 2014: keur 0) and increases the liabilities 
from derivative financial instruments. all embedded derivatives are level 3 instruments.  
 
28 
 
in 2015, derivative financial liabilities also relate to written put and purchased call options (synthetic 
forward transactions) on non-controlling interests of acquired companies pedidosya s.a. (pedidosya 
group) and inversiones cmr s.a.s. (clickdelivery group) totaling keur 22,659 as of december 31, 
2015 (december 31, 2014: keur 15,199). the option on non-controlling interests of baedaltong co. 
ltd. was cleared in 2015 (december 31, 2014: keur 4,656). in addition, for the pedidosya group 
there is also a variable purchase price component for the controlling interests in the value of own dhh 
shares. this is also linked to the value at the date of the exit event and amounts to keur 3,159 as of 
december 31, 2015 (december 31, 2014: keur 2,973). all of the derivatives described are level 3 
instruments. 
the contingent purchase price liability from the acquisition of e-food was keur 9,716 as of the 
reporting date and is a level 3 instrument. 
specific bank accounts, trademark rights and receivables serve as a collateral base for individual loan 
agreements and shares in individual companies are pledged as security. the agreements serve solely 
to secure payment obligations to creditors. no voting rights materialize for the pledgee from this. 
secured financial liabilities amount to keur 297,636 as of december 31, 2015 (december 31, 2014: 
keur 92,868).  the  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  assets  serving  as  collateral  amounted  to 
keur 875,718  (december 31,  2014:  keur 298,832),  which  mainly  related  to  investments  in 
subsidiaries which are eliminated for the purposes of the consolidated financial statements.

it expenses relate partly to expenses for research and development, for instance for the development 
of the order platform. despite strong growth, the dh group continues to be in the start-up and 
structuring  phase  of  company  organization,  administration  and  process  architecture.  the  close 
interaction between maintenance, adjustment to market conditions and the resulting development of 
the order platform does not currently permit the determination of research and development costs. the 
group is nevertheless working on a structure which will allow research and development costs to be 
quantified in future. further disclosures on research and development can be found in the group

other interest and similar income  1,253  172
total  26,725  6,287
  
the increase in income from the measurement of derivative financial instruments resulted from the 
subsequent measurement of the separated embedded derivatives and the derecognition of the related 
embedded derivatives in the course of restructuring the base loan instruments. 
the increase in income from the amortization of transactions costs was mainly a result of the effects 
on  earnings  connected  with  two  restructurings  of  a  loan  agreement  for  keur 100,000.  both 
restructurings led to derecognition in the income statement of the existing liability and a subsequent

e.  disclosures on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the consolidated statement of cash flows was prepared in accordance with ias 7 and shows the 
inflow and outflow of cash flows during the reporting year. cash flows are broken down into cash flows 
from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities. 
the cash flows arising from operating activities are determined using the indirect method pursuant to 
ias 7.18 (b). 
the cash and cash equivalents shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows correspond to cash 
and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position, namely cash on hand and at banks; please 
refer to section c.09. cash and cash equivalents accessible to the group amounted to keur 160,150 
as  of  december 31,  2015  (december 31,  2014:  keur 32,829).  some  of  the  payment  service 
providers used by the dh group block a minor percentage of the available credit for some days until 
the transactions are fully processed. please refer to section b.03.a) in respect of possible restrictions 
due to currency controls in china and argentina. 
the negative cash flow from operating activities in 2014 and 2015 results mainly from the loss for the 
period and the increase in current assets. the increase in trade receivables and other assets reflects 
in particular the company's growth. the cash flow from investing activities in 2015 mainly comprises 
the acquisitions presented in c.3 and investments in intangible fixed assets, mainly it software. the 
item "net payments for the acquisition of shares in consolidated companies" includes mainly the 
balance from the cash component of the consideration transferred and the cash and cash equivalents 
assumed (keur 235,169) for the company acquisitions as well as the buyback of minority interests 
(keur 4,106). the cash flows from financing activities reflects the cash increase in equity capital in 
2014  and  2015.  in  addition,  additional  loans were  taken  out both  in  2014  and  2015. the two 
contributed to securing the dh group's operations. the group is positioned very broadly, nevertheless 
it has not yet reached break-even. 
aggregated disclosures on assets and liabilities of acquired subsidiaries, inclusive of the acquired 
cash and cash equivalents and cash components of remuneration of the acquisition, are to be found in 
section b.02. disclosures on deconsolidation are to be found in section b.03.c). 
f.  other disclosures 
01.  share-based payment – ifrs 2 program 
the dh group has been operating a share-based payment program since 2011 so that top-level 
management participates in the development of the company and its contribution to the sustained 
success of the dh group is honored in comparison to the competition. the group of beneficiaries 
comprises members of management and the top management of delivery hero holding gmbh as well 
as management bodies and the top management of affiliates of the dh group. 
a)  vsp: description of the program 
five programs (virtual share program i-v) were approved by the advisory board of the company. 
the nominal value of each virtual share amounts to eur 1. shares are issued successively following 
approval. 
entitled  persons  have  an  individual  contractual  claim  on  the  company  for  payment  of  a  cash 
equivalent to the shares issued. in the case of a material change in the shareholder structure ("exit"), 
 
36 
 
these claims are immediately payable. an exit is deemed to exist if a sale or transfer of more than 
75% of all shares in the company occurs. an exchange or acquisition as part of an individual 
transaction or a series of consecutive transactions as well as a sale or transfer of more than 75% of 
assets or a liquidation or de facto liquidation of the company is treated in the same way.  
in the case of an exit, all claims on virtual shares already issued are immediately due for payment at 
the date of concluding the transaction. following the exit, tendered claims are being assigned on a 
monthly basis. the number of shares issued is individually specified in contractual agreements. in 
addition, additional or other tender scenarios or criteria governing the vested nature are individually 
specified and defined in the individual contractual agreements. the company, however, proceeded in 
2014 to standardize these arrangements in their entirety.  
the  exercise  prices  agreed  in  the  programs  (strike  prices)  vary  in  the  range  presented  below 
depending on the issuance date of the subscription right. shares in individual programs are distributed 
as follows: 
program  vsp i vsp ii vsp iii vsp iv  vsp v
strike price   1,031 -  1,053 - 
0 - 1 957 1 - 4,500
(in eur/piece)  1,500 4,000 
shares  776 958 4,300 7,731  1,190
expired shares  332 264 1,925 1,020  0
  
no rights to the subscription of gmbh ownership interests of the company and dividends resulting 
from ownership interests or distributions from the virtual shares are granted to entitled persons. in the 
event of conversion of the gmbh into a stock corporation, the virtual shares would be converted into 
share options. the arrangement for these share options after conversion to a stock corporation, e.g. 
whether settlement occurs in shares or in cash, has not yet been made. 
the vsps end on december 31, 2030. the individual agreements can be terminated by the company 
with  effect  from  december 31,  2030.  in  the  case  of  termination  of  agreements  as  of  or  after 
december 31, 2030, the company must provide compensation payment. 
all taxes, other levies or fees, which accompany the issuance of virtual shares or cash payments as 
part of these agreements are to be borne by the beneficiary and may be withheld by the company and 
deducted  from  payments  as  part  of  this  agreement.  excluded  from  this  are  the  corresponding 
employer's contributions which were added into the calculation. 
b)  vsp: vesting period/non-forfeiture 
to the extent that there are no other arrangements in individual agreements, the contractual vesting 
period extends over a period of 48 months. prior to the commencement of the contractual vesting 
period, an additional vesting period (cliff) of up to 12 months can be arranged on the part of the issuer 
and a period of up to 24 months can be arranged individually by the participant between the company 
and the beneficiary. these vesting periods have an impact on non-forfeiture as they present a type of 
waiting period from the beginning of the contractual subscription period and non-forfeiture of individual 
claims can materialize only at a later date. if the work or engagement relationship, irrespective of the 
reason, ends during the vesting period, the virtual shares expire.  
employees who opt to leave the company ('bad leaver') have no claim to virtual shares.  
measurement of share-based payment of employees is made using an option pricing model (black-
scholes model) based on the valuation of a call option on the company's shares. the volatilities used 
for this are derived by applying a standard peer group and amount to 40%. the exit was assumed for 
 
37 
 
the maturity of the options, namely december 31, 2016. market prices were determined using a 
company  valuation.  the  exercise  price  corresponds  to  the  aforementioned  strike  prices.  the 
underlying risk-free interest rate is 0%. to derive the underlying company valuation, a dcf-based 
company valuation was conducted based on the business plan and the statement of financial position 
as of the reporting date; the parameters for discounting the recovery of capital correspond to the 
specifications given for impairment testing (refer to section c.01.b)). assumptions regarding the key 
performance indicators of the business plan, such as the underlying ebitda margin, were also 
applied. the measurement using these parameters is shown below. changes in the measurement of 
liabilities arising from share-based payment were recognized through profit or loss in the respective 
period.

c)  e-food: description of share option program 
on may 2, 2015, ecommerce business 10 s.à r.l. granted the senior executives of ofd online 
delivery services ltd (ofd) ("beneficiaries" or "option holders") a share option for a portion of the 
shares in ofd. in connection with this, a put and call agreement was concluded between ecommerce 
business 10 s.à r.l. and the senior executives. the exercise of the put and call option agreed therein 
is dependent on the exercise of the share option and on the rendering of work performance by the 
senior executives. following each exercise of the share option, the option holder has the right to sell 
the shares in ofd acquired via the share option. this right is granted to the option holder for 30 days 
following exercise of the share option. the sale price of a share corresponds to the market value of all 
shares in the company at the respective vesting period of the share, multiplied by a performance 
factor and divided by the number of shares in the company. the option program allows senior 
executives to share in the performance of ofd. as the share option and the put and call agreement 
are mutually dependent, the option program, in economic terms, is considered a commitment that is 
accounted for as a share-based ifrs 2 program. 
 
38 
 
the commitment includes the option between the issuance of shares of a listed group company and 
the cash payment or issuance of shares of an unlisted company within the dh group. as no past dh 
group operational practice or declared guidelines exist on this issue and no legal obligation to make 
cash payment is present, this commitment is to be recognized as an equity-settled share-based 
payment transaction.  
the integrated option consists of two individual agreements. in the course of the first option, the 
founders have the right to buy shares in the greek company (ofd). the purchase price itself and the 
value  of  the  shares  itself  is  unclear  as  of  the  reporting  date.  in  the  case  that  the  option  is 
advantageous and is thus exercised, the founders again have the immediate right to tender the shares 
to dhh. in this case, the founders surrender their acquired shares and in return receive payment 
which via various contractual parameters is linked to key financial and operational performance 
indicators of ofd over the next few years.  
with respect to the economic dependency of the two transactions, the options were considered as one 
interdependent transaction, this means it is decisive for the exercise of the option whether the 
payment amount to the founders for the acquired shares in the (contingent) second option is larger 
than the purchase price to be paid by the founders for the shares in the first option.  
with regard to the two underlying shares of the agreements, two tranches are set out in terms of the 
vesting period, the number of shares granted and the future measurement dates. this is also taken 
into account in the measurement. 
due to the mutual dependency and the uncertainty as to future variables, the financial and operational 
benchmarks were derived from a multi-level, integrated monte carlo simulation. on the basis of 
resulting values, it was determined when the combined option is valuable and thus when it should be 
exercised.  
the measurement is based on publicly available, observable market data and on unobservable input 
parameters. the unobservable input parameters include mainly future financial and operational key 
performance indicators. these are simulated using a monte carlo method with the model being 
calibrated based on development in line with existing budget plans for the relevant companies. other 
financial key performance indicators were taken from the available financial statements of the relevant 
companies and extrapolated in line with the simulation results.  
measurement takes place just once at the conclusion of the agreement. a measurement is only 
repeated if the contractual parameters are modified. then the measurement takes place with due 
regard to the modified parameters – otherwise applying the same assumptions and conditions. 
for the commitment as agreed on may 2, 2015, an expense of keur 1,351 was recorded under 
administrative expenses in 2015. 
the agreement was modified on december 7, 2015. the original number of shares to be vested in 
tranche 1 was 47 and 93 in tranche 2. this was reduced in december 2015 to 30 shares in tranche 1 
and 40 shares in tranche 2.  
the vesting period for tranche 1 was originally may 2, 2015, to april 30, 2017, and for tranche 2 from 
may 2 to december 31, 2018. the contract modification extended the vesting period for tranche 1 until 
december 31, 2018 and tranche 2 until december 31, 2019. the modification also postponed the 
exercise period for one year. the vested purchase rights can be exercised between december 31, 
2019, and march 31, 2020, and expire after this time period. as of the reporting date december 31, 
2015, the average contractual life of the options was 3.5 years. 
the exercise price per share corresponds to the original amount of total contributions paid in the 
course of the acquisition of ofd as determined by the share purchase agreement, divided by the total 
 
39 
 
number of shares in the company. the contract modification increased the exercise price by a total of 
keur 8,866. 
in connection with revocation of a portion of the shares following the contract modification, an 
additional expense of keur 3,083 was recorded in 2015. 
with regard to the other modifications, a net adjustment was carried out. the re-measured fair value of 
the non-revoked shares following modification of the commitment (keur 2,592) is less than the fair 
value of the non-revoked shares in the course of the original commitment (keur 3,103). therefore in 
accordance with ifrs 2.b44, no adjustment was made with regard to the other modifications. 
the number of options and the weighted average exercise price developed in 2015 as follows: 
average exercise price 
   number of options

as of december 31, 2015, the average market value of the options granted in 2015 was keur 13 per 
option for tranche 1 and keur 68 per option for tranche 2. the weighted average option price was 
keur 160 for tranche 1 and keur 201 for tranche 2. 
the expected monthly (bi-annual) volatility in terms of revenue, which is the main influencing factor, 
amounted to 17.8% (7.6%). the expected monthly (bi-annually) volatility in terms of share price is 
14.5% (35.8%). no dividends are expected in the measurement model. the risk-free interest rate of 
0% is assumed. early exertion is not expected. 
d)  other ifrs 2 programs 
in addition to the two programs described above, there are another three programs drafted in 2015, 
which for reasons of materiality are summarized below. the aim of these programs is to allow for 
management of certain subsidiaries to share in the performance of the companies run by them. the 
programs are cash-settled, in the case of an exit, all claims on virtual shares already issued are 
immediately due for payment at the date of concluding the transaction. following the exit, tendered 
claims are being assigned on a monthly basis. the number of shares issued is individually specified in 
contractual agreements. in addition, additional or other tender scenarios or criteria governing the 
vested nature are individually specified and defined in the individual contractual agreements. during 
the programs the exercise price of rgp korea is between eur 1–2,000 per share, the other two 
programs hold no exercise price. 
 
40 
 
measurement of share-based payment of employees is made using an option pricing model (black-
scholes model) in line with the approach in measuring the virtual share program.

all  derivative  financial  instruments  are  classified  in  the  fair  value  hierarchy  as  level  3  as  the 
measurement is carried out on the basis of non-observable input factors. 
the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, granted loans, deposits 
received, trade and other payables have predominantly short terms and are approximately in line with 
the fair value as of the reporting date. 
the remaining available-for-sale financial assets (afs) shown in the statement of financial position 
refer to other investments and securities; these are recognized at cost as quoted prices on an active 
market are not available and the fair value cannot be reliably determined. there are currently no 
significant sale intentions.  
dhh loans liabilities are recognized at amortized cost. thus the carrying amount does not correspond 
to the fair value. the fair value of loan liabilities is determined as the present value of future cash flows 
taking account of risk-less interest rates valid as of the reporting date and a specific risk premium for 
dhh. 
net result by measurement category: 
in accordance with ifrs 7.20 (a), net gains and losses of financial instruments are to be disclosed for 
each measurement category of ias 39. 
the net results of individual measurement categories pursuant to ias 39 are as follows: 
net income (loss) by measurement category (in keur)  2015  2014
lar  -5,391  -2,608

flac  -28,526  -9,431
total  -40,423  -15,080
  
the net result of the lar measurement category contains impairment losses and reversals on trade 
receivables. the net result of the lar measurement category also includes interest income. the net 
result of the flhft measurement category includes results from the measurement of these derivatives 
at market prices. the net result of the flac measurement category includes interest expenses for 
ongoing debt service as well as the result from loan amortization which is also included in interest 
expense.

no reconciliation between the different levels of the fair value hierarchy took place during the financial 
year. 
released gains and losses from the change in level 3 instruments are recognized in the finance 
income/expense. unrealized gains or losses are recognized in revenue reserves and other reserves. 
the fair value of the separable embedded derivatives is determined using an option pricing model at 
each relevant reporting date. in the course of the measurement process, the required publicly-
available market data is collected and unobservable input parameters are updated using internal 
calculations. the latter relates in particular to the value determined for each company share of dhh 
and the specific risk premium for dhh. both parameters were updated on each measurement date. 
the calculation of the sensitivities for unobservable input parameters is presented in the section 
"market risks". 
the future payment obligation for non-controlling shares for pedidosya and clickdelivery is linked via 
different contractual parameters to the company value of dhh at the date of the exit event. owing to 
this interdependence, the fair value of put/call options is determined using monte carlo simulations. 
measurement is made at each relevant reporting date. in the course of the measurement process, the 
required publicly available market data is collected and unobservable input parameters are updated at 
the respective reporting date using internal calculations. the latter relates in particular to the value 
determined for each company share of dhh using a discounted cash flow approach, which represents 
the key influencing factor for the measurement result. volatility is derived from the historical volatility of 
peer group companies as of the reporting date. 
in line with the presentation above, the calculation of the fair value of the variable purchase price 
component of pedidosya group valued in own dhh shares is based on the value of each dhh 
company  share  as  determined  using  the  discounted  cash  flow  approach.  the  option  value  is 
calculated using the black-scholes model. the significant unobservable input parameters of the model 
 
45 
 
to calculate the value of dhh shares are found in section c.01.b). the estimated fair value of options 
would rise (decline) if the dhh share price was to rise (fall). 
the put/call options at baedaltong co., ltd. are based on a contractually determined subsequent 
settlement of deferred consideration and was settled in advance in 2015. 
the contingent payment obligation for the earn-out provision at ofd is linked via various contractual 
parameters to key financial and operational performance indicators of ofd over the next few years. 
due to the mutual dependency and the uncertainty as to future variables, the financial and operational 
benchmarks are derived from a monte carlo simulation. based on the results of the simulation, the 
value  of  a  potential  earn-out  payment  at  the  respective  future  dates  is  determined  based  on 
contractual agreements. the measurement is based on publicly available, observable market data and 
on unobservable input parameters. the unobservable input parameters include mainly future financial 
and operational key performance indicators. these are simulated using a monte carlo approach with 
the model being calibrated based on development in line with existing budget plans for the relevant 
companies.  other  financial  key  performance  indicators  were  taken  from  the  existing  financial 
statement of the related companies and extrapolated in line with the simulation results. measurement 
is made at each relevant reporting date and the parameters updated accordingly. this relates to both 
the  publicly  available  market  data  and  unobservable  input  parameters,  e.g.  the  ofd's  budget 
planning. 
b)  risk management 
the dh group considers itself exposed to default risks, liquidity risks and market risks, especially 
interest rate and foreign exchange risks, through the use of financial instruments. dhh actively 
monitors  these  risks  and  manages  them  using  an  effective  risk  management  system.  the  risk 
management function is integrated in group controlling. for a description of the risks arising from the 
use of financial instruments, we also refer to the relevant comments in the group management report. 
c)  credit risk 
the credit or default risk is the risk that the business partners, mainly restaurants, are unable to fulfill 
their payment obligations, which would mean the dh group incurs a loss. such risks mainly involve 
current trade receivables. the dh group does not regard itself as being exposed to a major default 
risk from any single individual customer. the concentration of the creditworthiness risk is limited due to 
the broad and heterogeneous customer base. the dh monitors the default risk and manages this 
actively  by  making  any  necessary  credit  checks  and  by  optimizing  the  payment  process. 
consequently, the risk is largely transferred to the restaurants (also by way of an effective debt 
collection system). 
the maximum default risk corresponds to the carrying amount of the financial assets. 
in addition, the following table presents the maturity structure of the financial assets that are not 
impaired, not past due date as well as those due as of the reporting date. in respect of receivables 
which are neither impaired nor past due date, there was no indication on the reporting date that the 
debtors would not meet their payment obligations.

d)  liquidity risk 
owing to strong growth, the dh group has to rely on external financing to ensure sufficient liquidity. a 
lack of external financing could threaten the group's ability to continue as a going concern. through 
proper budget planning, the dh group's liquidity management makes sure that sufficient funds are 
available. furthermore, a constantly secured and adequate amount of cash and cash equivalents 
ensures that operations can be financed. unused credit lines are also available. as stated in section 
f.03, the group has a loan that includes specific financial and non-financial covenants. a future 
breach of the covenants could lead to the loan being repayable earlier than specified in the table 
below. 
the  following  table  presents  contractual  (undiscounted)  interest  and  principal  payments  for  the 
dh group's non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments with negative fair 
value derivative financial liabilities are only taken into account in the analysis if the contractual due 
date  is  required  for  comprehension  of  the  timing  of  cash  flows.  the  maturity  is  based  on  the 
contractually determined interest obligations of financial liabilities.

e)  market risk 
the  dh  group  generates  a  significant  portion  of  its  revenue  in  foreign  currencies  through  its 
international subsidiaries. in order to reduce foreign exchange risk, the dh group generally tries to 
generate income and incur expenses in the same functional currency. nevertheless, each group entity 
of the dh group is exposed to currency risk as soon as transactions are concluded and the resulting 
payment flows do not correspond to the functional currency of the respective entity. the following table 
shows  the  income  statement  effects  that  would  result  if  the  presented  foreign  currencies  had 
appreciated or depreciated by 10% as of the reporting date.

a turkish subsidiary of the dh group holds cash in usd, harboring a foreign exchange rate risk 
between the try and usd, which effected the net income (loss) for the period. 
in addition, the dh group considers itself exposed to foreign exchange risk through its investment in 
international subsidiaries when translating net assets. however, this is not a foreign exchange risk as 
defined by ifrs 7.  
based on derivatives held or issued by the dh group as of the reporting date, a hypothetical change 
(quantified using sensitivity analysis) for the share values relevant to the respective instruments would 
have the following listed effects (before tax) as of the reporting date: 
financial instruments as of

separable embedded derivatives  -1,309  1,429

with respect to the determined value of the separable embedded derivatives (similar to the derivatives 
arising from put/call options and the variable purchase price component), the value per dhh company 
share determined using the discounted cash flow method is a parameter having a material impact on 
the measurement result. as of december 31, 2014, the sensitivity analysis is as follows: 
financial instruments as of       
december 31, 2014   effect on profit or loss 
in keur  +10%  -10%
separable embedded derivatives  0  0
variable purchase price component pedidosya  -297  297
derivatives from put/call options  -1,472  1,483
  
 
49 
 
in addition to dhh's share value and relative to the separable embedded derivatives, dhh's risk 
premium is another unobservable input factor. a 1% higher or lower risk premium would have led to an 
effect on profit or loss of keur +2,051 or keur +1,851. 
the expected future revenue of e-food is a key unobservable input factor in the measurement of the 
contingent purchase price obligation from the acquisition of the e-food group. a 5% higher or lower 
revenue would have led to an effect on profit or loss of keur -2,678 or keur +2,634. the estimated 
fair value of the obligation would rise (decline) if the dhh expected revenue of the e-food group was 
to rise (fall).

g.  accounting policies 
the dhh financial statements and those of subsidiaries in and outside of germany are prepared 
according to uniform accounting policies. in the process, the principles are consistently applied for all 
presented periods and reporting dates in the consolidated financial statements. 
01.  methods of consolidation 
a)  subsidiaries 
 
dhh and all subsidiaries over which dhh has the possibility of direct or indirect control are fully 
consolidated in the consolidated financial statements of the dh group. first-time consolidation occurs 
at the date of obtaining the possibility of control. dhh controls a participating undertaking when it is 
exposed to variable returns from its involvement and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power of control. if dhh loses the possibility of control, the relevant participating undertaking is 
deconsolidated. 
acquirees are recognized by applying the acquisition method. in applying the acquisition method, the 
cost of the acquired shares is offset against the proportionate fair value of the acquired assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at the acquisition date. a positive difference arising 
from  offsetting  is  capitalized  as  derived  goodwill.  negative  differences  that  result  from  capital 
consolidation at the date of acquisition are immediately reclassified from equity to profit or loss. 
non-controlling interests constitute the share of profit or loss and net assets that are not attributed to 
the parent's shareholders and are recognized separately. they are measured at the acquisition date 
using the proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets. changes in the group’s interest 
in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.  
concerning  written  put  options  agreed  in  the  course  of  acquisitions  regarding  remaining  non-
controlling interests, the company makes uses of its option. written put options are recognized 
according  to  the  anticipated  acquisition  method.  thus,  non-controlling  interests  were  no  longer 
recognized for these in the financial statements. 
when the group loses control of a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the 
subsidiary and all related non-controlling interests and other equity components. any gain or loss is 
recognized in profit or loss. any retained interest in the former subsidiary is recognized at fair value on 
the date when control was lost. 
expenses and income, as well as receivables and payables between consolidated entities, are 
eliminated along with intragroup profits/losses arising from intragroup transactions. 
in the case of a subsidiary, inclusion in the consolidated financial statements is waived due to the 
subordinate importance and materiality as well as the negative cost-benefit ratio. 
b)  associates and joint agreements 
associates are companies over which dhh has a significant influence; this usually assumes a holding 
of between 20% to 50% of voting rights. joint ventures are joint arrangements for which dhh jointly 
shares rights to the net assets of the arrangement with other companies. as of the reporting date, two 
associates were included in the consolidated financial statements (dec. 31, 2014: none). as in the 
prior years, in dhh's view there were no joint agreements. 
 
59 
 
the list of shareholdings in section f.09 contains a detailed overview of all dhh subsidiaries and 
associates. 
02.  currency translation 
currency translation is made in accordance with the functional currency concept. the functional 
currency for all subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements of dhh is the respective 
local currency. the consolidated financial statements are prepared in euro (reporting currency). 
transactions not conducted in the functional currency of an entity included in the consolidation group 
(foreign currency transactions) are translated into the functional currency of the respective unit at the 
rate  on  the  transaction  date.  exchange  gains  and  losses  arising  from  the  settlement  of  such 
transactions and from the measurement of monetary assets and liabilities are recognized in the 
income statement at the closing rate in the separate financial statements. 
for the purposes of inclusion in the consolidated financial statements of dhh, subsidiaries that do not 
have the euro as functional currency translate their separate financial statements, prepared in local 
currency, into the euro reporting currency as follows: 
•  assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate, income and expenses are translated at 
the average rate. 
•  equity subject to obligatory first-time consolidation in the course of acquiring international 
subsidiaries is translated at the respective reporting date with the historical rate at the date of 
acquisition. differences arising from currency translation are shown separately in equity. 
•  as  long  as  the  subsidiary  is  included  in  the  group  of  consolidated  entities,  translation 
differences are continued in group equity. if subsidiaries leave the group of consolidated 
entities, the corresponding translation difference are reclassified from equity to profit or loss. 
•  goodwill and restatements of the fair value of assets and liabilities due to acquisitions of 
international subsidiaries are treated as assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries and 
translated with the rate as of the reporting date.  
•  there are no subsidiaries registered in hyperinflation countries pursuant to ias 29.  
•  currency translation differences arising from the translation of shares in one international 
subsidiary as well as from loans, which are a part of the net investment in this international 
subsidiary,  are  recognized  in  equity.  if  an  international  subsidiary  leaves  the  group  of 
consolidated entities, the currency translation differences are derecognized through profit or 
loss.

03.  recognition of income and expenses 
expenses and income are not offset unless ifrs accounting requirements permit this or require 
offsetting. 
a)  revenue 
the dh group generates revenue from commission and fees for linking to the delivery hero online 
platform, for the provision of order confirmation terminals at contractual partners, for eye-catching 
presentation on the dh order platform (premium placement) and for the use of credit cards. 
commission is collected from restaurants for order forwarding via the delivery hero online platform.  
in generating commission income, the dh group acts as an agent as the dh group is solely an 
intermediary  between  the  main  supplier  and  the  end  customer.  the  corresponding  revenue  is 
 
61 
 
recognized as soon as the customer's online order is completed. commissions are recognized at fair 
value less discounts, value added tax and other price discounts. 
furthermore, dhh provides contractual partners with order confirmation terminals to confirm order 
acceptance directly to the customer via the delivery hero online platform. the dh group provides 
terminals on a leasing or purchase basis. in the case of selling a terminal, revenue is recognized as 
soon as the risks and rewards arising from the goods are transferred to customers, namely upon 
delivery. 
connection fees are realized directly after contact to the delivery hero online platform. fees are 
payable in all cases. 
fees for the use of credit cards are realized as soon as the customer order is fully processed and no 
further performance obligations are to be fulfilled on the part of the dh group. 
revenue from premium placement is recognized over the period in which this service is rendered by 
the dh group. 
service fees are collected from restaurants for the distribution of orders. in generating delivery 
income, the dh group acts as an agent as the dh group solely assumes delivery to the end 
customer. the corresponding revenue is recognized as soon as delivery is made to the customer. 
delivery fees are recognized at fair value less discounts, value added tax and other price discounts. 
b)  customer loyalty program 
some dh group companies have set up customer loyalty programs; customers can use these to 
collect points (award credits) through placing orders, entitling them to discounted ordering in future. 
award credits are recognized as separately identifiable components of sales transactions. the fair 
value of the consideration received in the course of the original sale is allocated to award credits and 
other components of the transaction. the relative fair value method is used to determine values. 
the award-credit portion of the consideration is recognized as revenue when the credit is redeemed 
and the group company has fulfilled its obligation to surrender the credit (refer also to section c.15). 
the amount of revenue is determined by the number of surrendered award credits in relation to the 
total number of expected credits to be redeemed. award credits expire 12 months after the day of the 
original transaction. 
c)  interest and similar income 
interest income is recognized as income when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the 
company and the extent of the income can be reliably determined. 
d)  expenses 
expenses are presented in the income statement as soon as the underlying service has been 
rendered. 
04.  property, plant and equipment 
items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses. cost also comprises incidental purchase costs less price reductions.  
depreciation occurs on a straight-line basis over the time period of the expected useful life of the 
asset. 
 
62 
 
in the reporting year, depreciation is based on the following useful lives: 
useful life in years  2015  2014
operating and office equipment  2-25  2-25
leasehold improvements  8-20  8-20
  
in addition, processes are introduced which take account of the requirements of ias 36 in respect of 
impairment of assets. the residual carrying amount as well as estimates of the expected useful life are 
checked at each reporting date for the occurrence of events that no longer justify the measurement. if 
the  carrying  amount  exceeds  the  recoverable  amount  for  the  individual  asset  value,  additional 
impairment losses are recognized directly in the income statement. if the requirements for impairment 
in following years are no longer in place, prior corrections are reversed. 
repair and maintenance expenses are expensed at the time of their occurrence. material innovations 
and improvements are capitalized. 
05.  intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets acquired for consideration are carried at amortized cost. they are amortized on a 
straight-line  basis  over  their  individual  useful  lives.  internally  generated  intangible  assets  are 
measured  at  cost  and  amortized  over  their  estimated  useful  lives.  development  expenditure  is 
capitalized if development costs can be reliably measured, the product or process is technically and 
commercially feasible, future benefit is probable and the group intends and has sufficient resources to 
be able to complete development and use or sell the asset. other development expenditure are 
expensed as incurred. capitalized development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated 
amortization and accumulated impairment losses. research costs are expensed as incurred. 
the expected useful life of the brand is forecast in accordance with verifiable history and observable 
user  behavior.  the  underlying  useful  life  of  customer  and  supplier  relationships  is  determined 
individually corresponding to historical migration rates.  
an annual review of intangible assets pursuant to ias 36 is made to check for necessary impairment 
losses in the dh group. this checks for the presence of indications of impairment. in this case, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the asset concerned. the recoverable amount is the higher of 
fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. market interest rates before tax are used for 
discounting. 
in the reporting year, depreciation is based on the following useful lives: 
useful life in years  2015  2014
software  2-3  2-3
trademarks  5-25  5-25
customer and supplier relationships  3-10  3-10
  
goodwill principally results from the acquisition of subsidiaries and corresponds to the sum of the 
transferred consideration, the amount of all non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value 
of the previously held equity interests in the acquiree less the fair value of acquired net assets. if the 
fair value of the acquired net assets exceeds the sum of the transferred consideration, the amount of 
all non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the previously held equity interests, 
the difference is directly recognized in the income statement. 
 
63 
 
in accordance with ifrs 3, goodwill is subjected to an impairment test pursuant to ias 36 annually as 
well as in the case of indications of impairment. for the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to a cash generating unit (cgu), the future cash flows of which are interdependent. in the 
dh group, cgus are largely monitored at the level of the operating segment, which – barring three 
exceptions in the international part of the group – corresponds to the individual companies. 
an impairment is made if the carrying amount of the individual cgu, to which goodwill is allocated, 
exceeds the recoverable amount. this recoverable amount corresponds to the higher of fair value less 
costs of disposal and its value in use. as the fair value cannot be reliably determined, testing for 
impairment of the value in use is made. 
the value in use of the cgu was calculated by applying the discounted cash flow method, as follows: 
owing to the character of the acquired companies and the condition of the business not yet being in 
full swing, 10-year detailed planning and, subsequently, revenue growth of 2% into perpetuity was 
considered for the valuation model. this forms the basis for determining the expected future free cash 
flows (before interest and taxes) of the cash-generating unit.  
the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) is used for discounting the thus determined excess 
cash flows; the wacc reflects the rate of return required by the capital markets to grant debt or equity 
capital to the dh group.  
cost of equity is determined using the capital asset pricing model (capm). the beta factor is derived 
from a peer group of comparable businesses. 
on the basis of the determined free cash flows before tax, a weighted average cost of capital before 
tax is used for testing goodwill for impairment.  
any possible impairment loss is not reversed in subsequent periods. 
06.  leases 
a)  accounting as lessee 
the dh group has entered into lease arrangements which do not meet the criteria for finance leases 
and are consequently classified as operating lease agreements. lease payments are recognized as 
expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
b)  accounting as lessor 
some companies in the dh group act as lessors in terms of order confirmation terminals which 
restaurants put into place to directly confirm order acceptance to the customer via the delivery hero 
online  platform.  as significant risks and rewards of  ownership  are retained  by  the dhh,  these 
agreements are classified as operating leases pursuant to ias 17. 
accordingly, dhh depreciates terminals on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life and 
recognizes lease payments in a similar way over the term of the lease agreement. 
07.  inventories 
inventories are carried at cost which is determined on the basis of direct production costs and 
production-related overheads.  inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value as 
of each reporting date.  
cost includes all costs of purchase, production and other costs that are incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition. the first-in, first-out method (fifo) is used to 
 
64 
 
measure cost. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion 
and estimated costs necessary to make the sale. 
08.  income taxes 
taxes on income for the period are the sum of current and deferred income taxes. these are 
recognized in the consolidated income statement unless they relate to items recognized directly in 
equity or other comprehensive income. in this case, income tax is also recognized directly in equity or 
other comprehensive income. 
a)  current income taxes 
the current income tax expense is calculated by applying the tax regulations enacted on the reporting 
date in countries in which the dh group operates and taxable income is generated. in assessing 
income tax demands and liabilities, estimates must be partially made. a deviating tax assessment by 
the respective tax authorities cannot be excluded. the associated uncertainty is taken into account by 
only stating uncertain tax demands and liabilities if the probability of occurrence from the perspective 
of dhh is greater than 50%. the expected tax payment is taken as a base as best estimate for the 
recognition of uncertain tax items. 
b)  deferred income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation  of  taxable  income.  furthermore,  deferred  tax  assets  are  recognized  for  tax  loss 
carryforwards. 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences.  
deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards to the extent 
to which it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences and/or loss carryforwards can be utilized. 
deferred taxes are measured in accordance with ias 12. the tax rate used corresponds to the 
adopted or virtually adopted tax rate which is relevant to the period of the reversal of temporary 
differences and/or loss carryforwards.  
the change in deferred taxes is recognized in the income statement provided it relates to items in the 
statement of financial position which were recognized in the income statement. if the items in the 
statement  of  financial  position  directly  relate  to  equity  or  other  comprehensive  income,  the 
corresponding deferred taxes are also recognized in these items.  
deferred tax assets and liabilities arising through temporary differences related to investments in 
subsidiaries, associates or joint arrangements are taken into account unless the date for reversal of 
temporary  differences  can  be  determined  at  group  level  and  it  is  probable  that  the  temporary 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if the group has a legally enforceable right to 
set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to 
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and concern the same taxable entity. in addition, 
deferred taxes concerning items in the statement of financial position with the same maturity are 
offset. 
 
65 
 
09.  financial instruments 
a)  financial assets 
in accordance with ias 39, financial assets are broken down into the following categories: 
a)  assets measured at fair value through profit or loss 
b)  loans and receivables 
c)  financial assets held for sale 
 
classification is made at first-time recognition. 
re. a) 
financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  financial  assets  held  for  trading.  this 
classification is made if the asset was acquired with the intention to sell in the short term. these 
assets are shown as current if their realization is expected within 12 months. all other assets are 
shown as non-current. 
derivative financial instruments are measured upon initial recognition and subsequently at fair value. 
financial derivatives held for trading purposes are recognized as current assets. 
re. b) 
loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that 
are not traded in an active market. they are included in current assets as long as their maturities do 
not extend beyond 12 months after the reporting date. otherwise they are classified as non-current 
assets. 
loans and receivables are stated at the date of first-time recognition at fair value plus transaction 
costs. subsequent measurement occurs at amortized cost. 
using empirical values and individual risk assessments, possible default risks are recognized using 
appropriate impairment taking into consideration net cash flows. in doing so, a distinction is made 
between specific valuation allowances and general valuation allowances. objective indications of the 
materialization of an impairment loss could be the following: indications of financial difficulties at a 
customer  or  group  of  customers,  default  or  delay  in  paying  interest  or  principal,  a  heightened 
probability of insolvency or observable data that point to a quantifiable contraction in estimated future 
cash flows from a group of financial assets. in the case of general valuation allowances, the group 
uses historical information on the timing of payments and the extent of losses occurring, adjusted by 
the executive board judging whether the current general business environment and credit conditions 
are such that the actual losses are probably higher or lower than the losses that would have been 
expected based on historical trends. 
if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment falls and this fall results from circumstances 
occurring after the first-time recognition of the impairment, the reversal of the impairment loss is 
recognized in the consolidated income statement. 
impairment losses are indirectly recognized through an allowance account. in the event of there being 
no realistic prospect of the receivable being collected, the carrying amount of the receivable is 
derecognized from the allowance account. 
cash and cash equivalents comprise all cash-related assets which have a remaining term of less than 
three months at the date of acquisition or investment. this includes mainly cash at banks and cash on 
hand. cash and cash equivalents are measured at nominal value. 
 
66 
 
re. c) 
held-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value if this can be reliably determined. if this is not 
possible, these assets are measured at cost less impairment losses.  
b)  financial liabilities 
in accordance with ias 39, financial liabilities are broken down into the following categories: 
a)  at amortized cost 
b)  measured at fair value through profit or loss 
 
re. a) 
financial liabilities are stated at fair value taking into account transaction costs as well as premiums 
and discounts at initial recognition. the fair value at the date of the financial liability being incurred 
corresponds to the present value of future payment obligations based on a market interest rate with a 
matching term and risk.  
subsequent measurement occurs at amortized cost using the effective interest method. the effective 
interest rate is determined at the date liabilities to banks are incurred. 
amendments to the terms and conditions in respect of the amount and/or date of interest and principal 
payments result in remeasurement of the carrying amount of the liability in the amount of the present 
value and on the basis of the originally determined effective interest rate. differences to the carrying 
amount of the liability previously stated are recognized in profit or loss. if changes in terms and 
conditions lead to materially different contract terms pursuant to ias 39.ag 62, the original liability is 
treated in accordance with ias 39.40 as if it were fully paid off. recognition subsequently occurs as a 
new liability at fair value. 
re. b) 
financial liabilities which are measured at fair value relate mainly to written embedded derivatives, 
earn-outs and liabilities from put/call options. 
10.  employee benefits 
a)  current employee benefits 
current employee benefits are expensed in the period service is rendered. a liability is recognized for 
the amount expected to be paid if the dh group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay 
this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be reliably 
estimated. 
b)  pension obligations 
pension obligations and similar obligations arise from the obligations of one dh group entity to its 
employees. the obligations of these defined benefit plans are measured using the projected unit credit 
method. under this method, expected future increases in salaries and pensions are taken into account 
in addition to the pensions and acquired pension entitlements known at the reporting date. 
pension obligations are determined by independent actuaries. effects arising from the remeasurement 
of actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the impact of any 
asset ceiling (excluding interest) are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and 
 
67 
 
other comprehensive income. the discount rate stated reflects the interest rate generated by senior 
fixed-interest bonds with matching maturities on the reporting date. 
the fair value of any plan assets is deducted from the discounted pension obligation. 
the interest rate effect included in pension expenses is recognized in the consolidated statement of 
profit or loss and other comprehensive income under interest expenses. service cost is shown in 
individual functional areas in operating profit. 
c)  share-based payments 
dhh grants group management and selected senior management share-based payment in the form of 
virtual shares (options). these virtual options mature as soon as an 'exit event' occurs. the acquisition 
of more than 75% of shares in dhh by one or more investors, as well as the liquidation of the 
company, is defined as an exit event. in addition, since 2015 there are further share-based payment 
programs at dhh subsidiaries. 
the components recognized in the income statement beyond the exercise period correspond to the 
fair value of options at the date of their being granted as the obligation by dhh is made in cash and/or 
in cash equivalents. in this regard, the fair value is determined using recognized measurement 
models.  recognition  of  the  obligation  and/or  its  increase  or  decrease  over  time  occurs  in 
administrative expenses. 
equity-settled share-based payment transaction are measured in the dh group at the fair value on the 
time of payment, the fair value being determined using approved measurement methods. the fair 
value of the obligation is recognized over the vesting period in administrative expenses and offset with 
the capital reserve. 
11.  other provisions 
other provisions are set up if a legal or constructive obligation to the dh group resulting from a past 
event exists, its fulfilment is probable and its amount can be reliably determined. recognition is made 
in the amount of the expected settlement amount.  
in view of estimation uncertainty in determining the amount, the actual outflow of resources may 
deviate from the original amounts recognized on the basis of estimates. 
non-current provisions are recognized at the discounted settlement amount on the reporting date 
based on corresponding term and risk matching interest rates. 
12.  fair value of financial instruments  
the fair value of financial instruments is determined on the basis of corresponding market values or 
valuation methods. the fair value of cash and cash equivalents and other current primary financial 
instruments  corresponds  approximately  to  the  carrying  amounts  recognized  on  the  respective 
reporting dates. 
the fair value of non-current receivables as well as other assets and liabilities is determined based on 
the expected cash flow using the reference interest rates valid at the reporting date. the fair value of 
derivatives is determined on the basis of option pricing models. 
the fair value of financial instruments carried on the statement of financial position is principally 
determined using corresponding market or exchange prices. if no market or exchange prices are 
available, measurement is made using standard valuation methods taking account of instrument-
specific market parameters. fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method, whereby 
 
68 
 
individual credit ratings and other market conditions are taken into account in the form of standard 
credit and/or liquidity spreads in determining present value. 
13.  determination of fair value 
according to the provisions of ifrs 13, fair value is the price that would be generated by the sale of 
the asset or paid to transfer a liability in the primary market or, if this is not available, the most 
advantageous market. fair value is to be determined using measurement parameters which are as 
market-based as possible as the input factors. the measurement hierarchy (fair value hierarchy) 
attributes three stages in descending order for input factors used in the valuation technique, placing 
the highest priority on the most market-based inputs: 
•  level 1: market prices (unadjusted) used in an active market for identical assets or liabilities 
which the entity can access on the valuation date. 
•  level 2: measurement parameters other than level 1 quoted prices which can be observed for 
assets or liabilities, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices). 
•  level 3: measurement parameters for assets and liabilities that are not based on observable 
market data. 
 
where various input factors are relevant for measurement, the fair value is categorized at the same 
level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. 
14.  government grants 
government grants are recognized if there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be made and 
the entity complies with the conditions attached to them. expense-related grants are recognized as 
income over the period required to offset them with the corresponding expenses that the grants are 
meant to compensate for. 
15.  judgment and use of estimates 
in the application of accounting policies and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, 
management makes decisions based on judgment and estimates. this applies in particular to the 
following cases: 
a)  judgments 
going concern assumption: 
dhh continues to be reliant on external financial resources; in 2015 considerable equity and debt 
financing was raised to secure future business activities. as a consequence, the going concern 
assumption is deemed to be satisfied. 
revenue recognition of commission income: 
dhh classifies its intermediary activity as agent activity as dhh does not act as the main supplier, is 
not exposed to storage risk, cannot influence the pricing of counterparties and receives commission as 
remuneration. 
use of the anticipated acquisition method for acquisitions: 
for put  options written on  remaining  non-controlling  interests in  the course  of  acquisitions,  the 
company makes use of its de facto option and recognizes the put options as if they had already been 
exercised in accordance with the anticipated acquisition method  as a consequence, put options are 
 
69 
 
treated as contingent considerations. to that effect, no non-controlling interests are shown for these 
interests in group equity. 
b)  assumptions and estimation uncertainty 
recognition and measurement of other provisions 
in respect of recognition and measurement, there are uncertainties in respect of future price increases 
as well as in respect of the extent, date and probability of utilization of the respective provision. 
measurement of financial liabilities 
in measuring financial liabilities, estimates of future cash flows and any changes in terms and 
conditions are of particular significance. furthermore, estimates are required for entity-specific risk 
premiums. 
scope for recognizing deferred tax assets 
an excess of deferred tax assets is only recognized if it is probable that future tax benefits can be 
realized based on tax budgets. the current taxable profit situation in future reporting years and thus 
the actual usability of deferred tax assets can vary from the estimate made at the date of recognizing 
deferred  taxation.  recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets  on  tax  loss  carryforwards  or  temporary 
differences is made based on future taxable income as part of a planning horizon of five reporting 
years. 
share-based payment (ifrs 2) 
in  respect  of  the  accounting  of  virtual  shares,  assumptions  and  estimates  are  made  for  the 
development of performance indicators and fluctuation as well as the determination of entity value. 
these are determined using option pricing models. 
goodwill impairment testing 
determination of the recoverable amount requires assumptions and estimates, in particular on the 
future development of ebit and sustainable growth rates. 
additional comments on the assumptions and estimates made are listed in the individual financial 
statement items in the disclosures. all assumptions and estimates are based on the conditions 
prevailing and assessments at the reporting date. 
in assessing the future business development, the business environment, assumed as realistic at this 
point, was also taken into account for the sectors and regions in which the dh group operates. while 
management assumes that the assumptions and estimates used are appropriate, any unforeseeable 
changes to these assumptions could affect the group's financial position, financial performance and 
cash flows.

the following new standards are currently being examined by dhh for their effect on information to be 
presented in the consolidated financial statements. at the time of preparing the consolidated financial 
statements for the 2015 reporting period, dhh cannot yet completely assess the effects of the new 
provisions. dhh will perform a more precise assessment of the impacts in the near future.  
 
71 
 
•  ifrs  9:  this  standard  serves  recognition,  measurement  and  derecognition  of  financial 
instruments and introduces new provisions on hedge accounting. in july 2014, the iasb 
published further changes to the provisions on recognition and measurement and a new 
model for recording impairments. the new standard for financial instruments is now fully 
completed following publication of the most recent amendments.  
•  ifrs 15: this standard replaces ias 18 for income from the sale of goods and income from 
service transactions and ias 11 for construction contracts. the aim of the new standards is for 
income to be first recognized upon completion of the supply of the goods or rendering of 
services. the concept of recognizing income upon completion of the performance obligation 
by the company replaces the existing concept of risks and consideration. the standard allows 
for modified retrospective adoption. this means that during the transition period companies 
can recognize the adjustments as retained earnings until the date of first adoption without an 
entry in the comparative period. these new provisions are only used for agreements not yet 
fulfilled at the time of first time adoption. 
•  ifrs 16: this standard replaces the currently applicable standards for lease accounting (ias 
17, sic-27 and ifric 4) and governs the recognition, measurement, disclosure and the tax 
liabilities in relation to the leases of both contracting parties, i.e. the lessee and lessor. the 
most significant amendment that the new standard introduces is the recognition by the lessee 
of all assets from lease agreements. there are exceptions for certain current and low-value 
assets.

i.  subsequent events 
dhh continued to improve its equity base in 2016 up to the date of preparing the 2015 consolidated 
financial statements. in january 2016, a portion of the yemek sepeti vendor loan was contributed to 
the capital reserve in return for the issue of newly created dhh share certificates. 
in addition, considerable external funding was obtained from a banking consortium granting dhh a 
credit line of up to keur 120,000 in february 2016 for general company financing. the loans are 
secured by, inter alia, shareholdings, bank accounts, receivables and industrial property rights and 
copyrights of dhh and its significant subsidiaries. the loan periods are between three and four years 
per tranche. a portion of the funds is used for early repayment of the yemek sepeti vendor loan, 
which bears interest at significantly higher rates. 
in march 2016, management decided to cease business operations in china and operations under the 
valk fleet brand, which is to have a positive impact on the group's financial performance over the 
coming years as these business activities have thus far only made negative contributions to the 
group's performance.

a.  group profile 
01.  business model 
the delivery hero group ("delivery hero" or "group") offers online food ordering services with a 
presence in over 30 countries on five continents. this includes various countries not only in europe, 
latin and south america, but also asia, north america and australia. 
using internet platforms, customers can choose from a variety of delivery services in their country and 
view the menus of these services. the order can be placed by app or through the website and 
subsequently paid for either in cash or using cashless means of payment. delivery hero generates the 
majority of its revenue from commission on orders. delivery hero offers catering establishments the 
option of a delivery and point of sale system that allows them to immediately view and accept the 
orders placed on the platform. in addition, delivery hero offers products and services such as food 
packaging as well as advertising and printing services for catering establishments. 
02.  business model 
the parent company delivery hero holding gmbh ("dhh") was founded in 2011 with its registered 
office in berlin and has expanded its presence to local markets worldwide since then. following 
considerable acquisitions in 2015, the delivery hero group's global consolidation scope included 
106 companies (py: 40 companies) as of the reporting date. further information can be found in 
section 2c) of the economic report. dhh exercises complete control over all subsidiaries either 
directly or indirectly. 
delivery hero holding gmbh is managed by a ceo who is directly supported by other executives in 
the area of strategy, finance, operations and information technology (in short "it"). management is 
monitored by an advisory board.  
03.  management system 
revenue  is the  most  important key  financial  performance  indicator  for  managing  the  company. 
besides financial performance indicators, an array of non-financial performance indicators are used to 
manage the company. these are explained further in chapter b.02. d) financial and non-financial key 
performance indicators. 
04.  research and development 
the majority of the staff in the it division work not only on ensuring that orders are processed 
smoothly, but also on further developing the ordering platforms that are used by delivery hero group 
in the respective sales markets. these platforms represent the core resource for generating revenue 
at delivery hero group.  
 
1 
research and development in this division focuses on providing the user with a comfortable, reliable 
and secure ordering platform. in addition, the switch towards the increased use of mobile applications 
is also to be addressed by the technology. the fact that it is difficult to split up the activity into 
maintenance, safeguarding, further and new development and also that the systems are constantly 
being improved means that it is not possible to separate the individual areas in quantitative terms. the 
essential structures and content of research and development activities in the delivery hero group did 
not change in comparison with the prior year. 
the group's total expenses for the it department equaled eur 22,437. this corresponds to 11% of 
revenue in 2015. it is currently not possible to provide an exact allocation of employee numbers on 
account of the organization of product, development, maintenance and design work within the it 
department.  therefore  it  is  also  not  possible  to  break  down  total  expenses  into  research  and 
development  activities.  due  to  limited  personnel  capacities,  third  parties  are  also  utilized  for 
development services. 
b.  economic report 
01.  general economic conditions and industry environment 
moderate economic growth was observed in 2015 for the relevant markets in europe where delivery 
hero is active. year-on-year gdp growth equaled a price-adjusted 1.5% in germany, 0.4% in finland, 
2.2% in the uk, 0.8% in austria, 3.6% in poland, 3.4% in sweden and 4.4% in the czech republic.1 in 
the markets outside europe, growth in gross domestic product fluctuated between 6.9% in china, 
2.4% in australia and 2.6% in south korea.2 
on the other hand, economic development south american markets shows a different picture in 2015. 
while countries like uruguay and colombia experienced strong growth of 1.5% and 3.1% respectively, 
a  significant  decline  in  gdp  of  3.8%  reflects  the  domestic  political  difficulties  in  brazil.3  the 
development in the markets relevant for delivery hero on the arabian peninsula was similarly positive 
in 2015. the economies of the countries in the gulf cooperation council (gcc), which mainly 
includes the markets where delivery hero is active, grew by 3.3% in 2015.4 an increase in 3.8% in 
turkey in 2015 was marginally higher than this.5 
on the markets in europe especially relevant to delivery hero group, the price-adjusted change in 
private consumer spending in 2015 compared to the prior year was between 1.7% in finland and 
3.9% in the czech republic.6 spending by private households for the consumption of food services7, 
as provided by the delivery hero group, also remain highly country-specific. in delivery hero's 
european markets, spending on food services as a percentage of total household spending fluctuates 
between 10.0% in austria and 2.3% in poland.8  
there are often strong competitors in the regional markets, such as lieferando in germany or just eat 
in the uk, whose strategies and market penetration vary regionally within these countries. the market 
for ordering food online is characterized by fierce global competition. the target group is primarily

medium- and high-income households. in addition, restaurant chains such as domino’s pizza also 
offer their own online ordering services for their respective products. in some countries, however, 
delivery hero has established and is continuing to expand a dominant position. 
02.  business performance 
a)  revenue performance 
the dh group continued the strong growth in its core business in 2015. at keur 199,507 (py: 
keur 88,008), revenue in the reporting period again more than doubled. 
besides the sharply rising number of restaurants and new users, revenue growth was heavily driven 
by external acquisitions. as a result, comparability in particular of the group's financial performance 
with the prior year is therefore limited. the companies acquired during the year were consolidated only 
on a pro-rata basis in 2015.  
the following overview shows the proportionate annual revenue acquired within the scope of the first-
time consolidation of these companies/groups: 
first-time consolidation  company  2015
may 1, 2015  yemek sepeti group  21,830
may 1, 2015  e-food group  1,757
june 1, 2015  talabat group  9,266
oct. 1, 2015  foodora group  3,551
total     36,404
  
b)  financing measures 
in 2015, as part of various funding rounds, delivery hero was able to secure investor funds in the form 
of increases in capital, which occurred via both non-cash and cash contributions. in total, delivery 
hero received keur 458,347 in cash and cash equivalents. 
this broader equity base supports both the operating activities of delivery hero and its growth through 
acquisitions. in addition, the company also received keur 97,354 in cash as a result of taking out a 
loan. this loan has a nominal value of keur 90,000 and has fixed interest and repayment rates and 
an additional issue of cover shares to the lenders. it is to be repaid by 2018 but can unilaterally be 
terminated by dhh at any time. 
furthermore, a loan with a nominal value of keur 100,000 from 2014 was restructured in 2015 
leading to an increase in capital which will have a positive impact on the liquidity situation. 
c)  acquisitions 
in  the  2015  reporting  period,  considerable  investments  were  made  by  acquiring  the  following 
companies: 
•  yemek sepeti elektronik iletisim tanitim pazarlama gida sanayi ve ticaret a.s., istanbul, 
turkey, and subsidiaries 
•  ofd online food delivery services limited, nikosia, cyprus, and subsidiaries 
•  talabat general trading and contracting company w.l.l, kuwait, and subsidiaries 
•  digital services xxxvi s.à r.l. luxembourg, food delivery holding 15 s.à r.l. and subsidiaries 
 
 
3 
the equity and loans received in 2015 were mainly used for the acquisition of these companies. 
the biggest transaction was the acquisition of the turkish competitor of delivery hero, the yemek 
sepeti group. the acquisition of yemek sepeti group significantly affected the group's financial 
position,  financial  performance  and  cash  flows.  the  acquisition  of  the  turkish  market  leader 
significantly increased the group's order and user numbers and as a result significantly increased 
revenue. the acquired intangible assets of the yemek sepeti group led to a significant increase in the 
group's non-current assets. 
the talabat group operates successful online food ordering platforms in the arabian peninsula and is 
the market leader in the region. in its home market kuwait, talabat already operates at a profit and 
generates stable ebitda margins. management considers the future market potential in the middle 
east to be substantial. overall, the talabat group already makes a positive contribution to the results 
of operations of the delivery hero group. the acquired intangible assets of the talabat group led to a 
significant increase in the group's non-current assets. 
in addition to the acquisition of companies in turkey, the middle east, delivery hero also expanded its 
position in europe. by acquiring ofd online food delivery services limited, the group took over a 
competitor with a strong position in the greek market, thereby further expanding its continental 
european market leadership. as online delivery was still a relatively young company at the time of the 
acquisition,  there  was  no  direct  significant  effect  on  the  group's  financial  position,  financial 
performance and cash flows at first. 
by contrast, the focus of the foodora acquisition was on the technology factor and the strategic 
positioning as a premium vendor. with foodora as a partner, delivery hero is looking to further perfect 
its delivery systems and logistics services. as foodora was still a relatively young company at the time 
of the acquisition, there was no direct significant effect on the group's financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows at first. 
d)  financial and non-financial performance indicators 
revenue represents the most significant financial performance indicator for delivery hero. it reflects 
the capacity to sell services in the market and makes it possible to determine the group's competitive 
position. in addition, the ebitda result of the subsidiaries and the group is used for management; for 
more  detailed  information  on  the  structure  of  revenue,  see  the  comments  on  the  consolidated 
statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements. 
in the non-financial area, the most important indicators are the number of orders per financial year and 
the number of restaurants included in the online platforms: 
•  number  of  orders:  this  performance  indicator  tracks  orders  placed  by  end-customers  in  the 
respective period. 
•  restaurants  online:  this  performance  indicator  presents  the  number  of  restaurants  on  the 
respective platform that end customers can order from during the reporting period. 
thus, the number of orders increased from 39.5 million in the prior year to 111.5 million in the 
reporting year due to organic growth and acquisitions. the number of restaurants included on the 
platform increased just as significantly. it increased from approx. 91,000 to almost 300,000. 
e)  business development 
the high increases in both new users and restaurants are due to the company acquisitions and the 
success of marketing and sales activities that were stepped up in the financial year. in addition to 
 
4 
conventional advertising, such as tv commercials and online advertising, marketing collaborations 
were increasingly used to position the respective brands in the local markets. 
especially organization and administration at delivery hero were once again improved in the financial 
year under review. as part of the rapid growth of the local operating companies, back office and the it 
department  were  expanded  to  create  structures  for  further  growth  from  operations.  in  addition, 
processes were analyzed in the local companies to identify their potential for optimization. further 
investments in outstanding customer service were made around the world.  
in management's opinion, business development progressed favorably in view of the strong organic 
sales growth in 2015. management feels that positive operating performance confirms that delivery 
hero group's services represent an attractive product worldwide for which there is still strong demand 
potential. 
03.  employee development 
average headcount increased from 1,018 employees in 2014 to 2,843 employees in 2015. 
the following is an overview by function: 
function  2015 2014  change
delivery  432 0    
sales  712 482  48%
marketing  861 182  373%
it  401 207  93%
management  59 40  48%
office administration  378 107  254%
total  2,843 1,018  179%
  
this increase was due to the acquisitions made in the reporting year. in addition, there was a group-
wide expansion of operating activities which was continued in 2016. 
skilled and motivated employees represent one of the most important resources for delivery hero 
group. at the same time, delivery hero group, like so many other companies, is being affected by a 
shortage of qualified employees. for that reason, some companies in delivery hero group are 
conducting active applicant management with their own specialized staff, especially on various online 
networks and also at trade fairs. employees of delivery hero group are supported in their continuing 
and further education; at german subsidiary lieferheld gmbh, for example, through an in-house 
leadership academy by training programs for executives.

04.  financial position, financial performance and cash flows 
a)  financial performance 
the group's financial performance is presented below in a condensed statement of profit and loss: 
in thousands of euro (keur)  2015 2014  change %
revenue  199,507 88,008  127%
cost of sales  -29,585 -16,933  75%
gross profit  169,922 71,075  139%
selling expenses  -230,755 -89,308  158%
admin. expenses (excl. depreciation/amortization)  -100,725 -55,919  80%
other operating income  10,202 6,152  66%
other operating expenses  -17,595 -2,134  725%
ebitda  -168,951 -70,134  141%
ebitda margin (%)   -84.7% -79.7%  6%
amortization/depreciation in admin. expenses  -48,903 -11,096  341%
ebit  -217,854 -81,228  168%
ebit margin (%)   -109.2% -92.3%  18%
  
delivery hero group's revenue rose by keur 111,499 in the reporting period. the growth is mainly 
due to organic growth, which accounts for an increase in revenue of keur 75,095, representing an 
increase of 85.3% over the prior year. beside this, the acquisitions made in the reporting year 
contributed keur 36,404 to revenue growth. the geographic distribution of revenue is presented in 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements under d.01. the growth in revenue was achieved 
thanks to a significant increase in the number of food orders on the online platforms. the number of 
orders climbed from 39.5 million as of december 2014 to 111.5 million in the reporting year. 
cost of sales rose at a disproportionately low rate to revenue, increasing by keur 12,652 as these 
are, in part, fixed costs. credit card costs, impairment losses on receivables and personnel expenses 
due to more deliveries by own employees increased largely due to transaction volumes. 
stepped-up  market  penetration  activities  drove  up  marketing  expenses  disproportionately  by 
keur 130,855. the biggest drivers behind this increase were expenses for tv and radio advertising 
with  an  increase  of  keur 40,787,  costs  for  optimizing  the  customer's  internet  searches,  email 
advertising and other advertising and marketing measures and personnel expenses. 
it expenses rose mainly due to building up personnel resources as part of the group's growth. 
administrative expenses also rose sharply by keur 44,806 due to group expansion. increased 
expenses for share-based payments, advisory services and travel were the main reasons for the 
increase in administrative expenses. 
other operating expenses and income increased significantly and mainly included currency translation 
effects. 
negative  ebitda  increased  by  141%.  due  to  operating  expenses  that  rose  disproportionately 
because of build-up activities, the ebitda margin deteriorated further from -79.7% to -84.7%. 
depreciation and amortization primarily included the amortization of intangibles assets, such as rights, 
licenses, brands and customer relationships, as well as the depreciation of property, plant and 
 
6 
equipment. the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses resulted mainly from higher 
amortization of intangible assets acquired within the course of the company acquisitions in 2015. 
b)  cash flows 
the group's cash flows are shown using the condensed statement of cash flows below: 
in thousands of euro (keur)  2015  2014
cash and cash equivalents at beginning of financial year  32,829  9,286
cash flows from operating activities  -146,865  -54,518
net cash used in investing activities  -257,465  -302,638
cash flows from financing activities  533,306  380,662
effect of exchange rate movements on cash and cash equivalents  -1,654  37
net increase/decrease in cash and cash equivalents  128,975  23,506
cash and cash equivalents at end of financial year  160,150  32,829
  
the negative cash flows from operating activities predominantly resulted from the net loss for the 
period. the change in working capital as presented in the consolidated statement of financial position 
resulted mainly from the acquisitions made in the reporting year and thus had only a minor impact on 
cash flows from operating activities. 
cash flows from investing activities essentially include shares purchased and associated investments 
in intangible fixed assets. on account of its business model, the group generally has relatively minor 
other investing activities in property, plant and equipment as most of the capital is tied up in intangible 
assets. 
cash flows from financing activities reflect the cash increase in equity in 2015. there was also further 
borrowing in 2015. both contributed to securing delivery hero's operations and the financing of 
acquisitions.  more  information  on  financing  measures  is  included  in  section 2  (business 
development). 
in 2015, the solvency of the parent company and the subsidiaries was ensured, in particular, through 
payments  received  from  shareholders  in  the  course  of  capital  increases  and  the  issuance  of 
convertible loans. management expects that the shareholders and/or other potential investors will 
provide the funds necessary for the parent company, the subsidiaries concerned and, thus, the group 
to continue as going concerns until their financial position has stabilized, and has therefore prepared 
the financial statements on a going concern basis. 
overall, continuation of the parent company, its subsidiaries and the group as a going concern is 
therefore  dependent  on  implementing  further  measures  to  secure  capital  and  liquidity  by  the 
shareholders and/or additional potential investors. furthermore, recoverability of the reported carrying 
amounts for goodwill are dependent on realization of the revenue and ebitda growth assumed in the 
budget. 
the liquid resources reported under cash and cash equivalents were not subject to any material 
constraints on disposal as of the reporting date. local exchange controls in china and argentina mean 
the transfer of capital to other countries can be restricted. 
the majority of liabilities and provisions is due within one year; only liquid funds of keur 332,266 for 
loans are due within 1-5 years.

c)  financial position 
the group's financial position is illustrated using a condensed statement of financial position: 
dec. 31,  dec. 31, 
assets  2015 share 2014 share  change
non-current assets  1,196,074 86% 469,929 91%  726,145
current assets  193,371 14% 47,855 9%  145,516
total assets  1,389,445 100% 517,784 100%  871,661
  
dec. 31,  dec. 31, 
equity and liabilities  2015 share 2014 share  change
equity  765,492 55% 268,843 52%  496,650
non-current liabilities  443,239 32% 184,846 36%  258,393
current liabilities  180,714 13% 64,096 12%  116,618
total equity and liabilities  1,389,445 100% 517,784 100%  871,661
  
driven by acquisitions, the group's gross assets rose significantly by 168%. of the additional assets, 
the larger portion was financed using own resources and a smaller portion through non-current 
borrowings.  
the  situation  of  gross  assets  being  predominantly  made  up  of  non-current  assets  remained 
unchanged. these are mainly intangible assets by a significant margin. essential intangible assets as 
of  the  reporting  date  included  keur 519,558  in  goodwill,  keur 489,845  in  brands  and 
keur 146,140 in customer and supplier relationships. investments made in property, plant and 
equipment amounted to keur 5,024 in 2015. 
the marked increase in current receivables in 2015 was largely due to growth in operating activities.  
the significant increase in current assets in 2015 resulted mainly from the expansion of operating 
activities and from the following described measures following the acquisition-related cash outflows 
leading to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of keur 127,321. 
apart from equity, the liabilities side of the statement of financial position consists mainly of non-
current borrowings. current borrowings only accounted for 13%. 
the liabilities side of the statement of financial position consists mainly of non-current liabilities in 
addition to equity. equity increased by keur 781,289 in 2015 due mainly to various measures that 
had an effect on equity. this increase was partially offset by the negative total comprehensive loss of 
keur -287,169. the equity ratio increased in total from 52% to 55%. of equity, keur 6,469 was 
attributable to non-controlling interests as of the reporting date. 
as of the reporting date, non-current liabilities mainly included deferred tax liabilities of keur 138,671 
(py: keur 55,772), which was largely attributable to the intangible assets acquired during the course 
of the company purchases, and loans of keur 290,294 (py: keur 109,657) taken out to finance 
company acquisitions and general company activities. a loan taken out in august 2014 with a nominal 
value of keur 100,000 was divided into two tranches in 2015. this restructuring meant that the term 
was extended and the interest rates were reduced in favor of a higher share in equity shares. 
 
8 
the rise in current liabilities is the result of both an increase in operating activities and a rise in 
commitments relating to financial derivatives, which resulted mainly from the company acquisitions in 
the reporting year. 
d)  overall evaluation 
management rates the overall financial position, financial performance and cash flows of operations as 
positive or – in view of the major expansion carried out during the reporting period – as expected. 
even though the group continued to generate significant losses, these are within the scope of what 
was expected and budgeted for in light of the acquisitions and, in some cases, related to fundamental 
business start-up work. there were substantial equity resources as of the reporting date. in addition, 
some companies already made a positive contribution to consolidated earnings in 2015. 
in the 2014 group management report, the group aimed to significantly increase the total number of 
platform  users  and  the  number  of  orders,  thereby  also  significantly  increasing  revenue.  these 
increases were to be generated from organic growth and further company acquisitions. 
revenue increased by 127% in the reporting year, which represents a very sharp increase. included in 
this is inorganic revenue growth as a result of company acquisitions in 2014 and 2015, which for the 
most part materialized as forecast. 
c.  subsequent events 
the group was able to further expand both its equity and debt capital base in 2016. in january 2016, 
a share of the yemek sepeti vendor loan was contributed to the capital reserve in return for the issue 
of newly created dhh share certificates. 
in addition, considerable financing with borrowed funds could be secured with a banking consortium 
granting dhh a credit line of up to keur 120,000 in february 2016 for general company financing. 
the loans are secured by, inter alia, shareholdings, bank accounts, receivables and industrial property 
rights and copyrights of dhh and its significant subsidiaries. the loan periods are between three and 
four years per tranche. a portion of the funds is used for early repayment of the yemek sepeti vendor 
loan, which bears interest at significantly higher rates. 
in march 2016, management decided to cease business operations in china and operations under the 
brand name valk fleet, which is to have a positive impact on the group's financial performance over 
the coming years as these business activities have thus far only made negative contributions to the 
group's earnings. 
d.  forecast, opportunities and risk report 
01.  forecast 
a)  future general economic conditions and industry environment  
the global economy is expected to see an increase in gross domestic product of 2.9% in 2016 (after 
3.0% in 2015).9 positive global economic development will continue to be largely driven by emerging 
markets such as china and india, where the economic difficulties, however, will only be gradually

overcome. economic downturn in china and the widespread monetary expansion policy of various 
central banks represent substantial risks for the world economy.10 
the global market for food delivery services continued to grow in 2015 with a current turnover of 
approx. eur 83.1 billion.11 this market is expected to grow by an annual average of 3.6% over the 
coming years.12 in addition to increasing urbanization, key drivers for this development are a further 
increase in medium-income households and an increase in consumer spending. in addition, further 
increases in internet penetration will also lead to further growth of delivery hero's relevant market, i.e. 
online delivery services. currently, asia and the middle east account for approx. 37% of the global 
market for food delivery services, followed by europe at approx. 32%, north america at 23% and latin 
america at approx. 7%. latin america, however, is expected to see one of the highest growth rates at 
an expected market growth rate of 4.2%.13 a sub-segment of the market for food delivery services is 
the market for internet food delivery services, which involves orders being placed online via dedicated 
ordering platforms. the group expects considerably higher growth rates for this relatively young 
market segment compared to the traditional delivery market involving phone orders. 
b)  future development of the group 
therefore, delivery hero group's management predicts that both the number of orders and the 
number of affiliated restaurants will continue to increase in the 2016 financial year. these increases 
will continue to be supported by concentrated marketing measures in 2016, which should ensure the 
lasting use of the order platform by existing customers and the acquisition of new customer. the 
number of orders in 2016 is to increase by 30% year on year. the number of platforms included on the 
platform (restaurants online) is to slightly increase in 2016 thereby supporting the growth of orders and 
thus revenue growth. 
in the course of these measures, management expects revenue to increase in the 2016 financial year 
by more than 60% (adjusted for currency effects), albeit not quite so sharply as in the reporting year. 
besides the organic growth of the group described above, this increase is to result from the first-time 
full-year consolidation of the companies acquired in the 2015 reporting year.  
at the same time, management expects to reduce the negative ebitda due to the continued growth 
strategy and the cost reduction program initiated in 2015. furthermore, it is expected that higher 
amortization of the intangible assets identified in the 2015 purchase price allocations, which will have 
a full-year effect for the first time, will have negative effects on the net income for the year. however, 
management sees large growth potential in the development of markets for online food ordering 
services. however, the group must still bear further start-up costs. for this reason, the group 
anticipates negative editda in the medium double-digit millions for 2016. according to the available 
forecasts, ebitda break-even will be achieved in 2017. 
c)  overall evaluation by management 
overall, the course in the 2015 financial year and the economic situation are considered favorable. 
the delivery hero group reach its growth target and significantly strengthened its capital basis 
allowing the group to finance further growth. 
assumptions regarding the economic development of the market and the industry are based on 
estimates that the management of delivery hero group currently considers realistic based on the 
information available. however, these estimates are subject to uncertainty and entail the unavoidable 
risk that forecast developments will not actually occur, either in terms of their trend or extent. the

forecast is based on the composition of the group in the forecast period as known at the time of 
planning. 
the activities of delivery hero are subject to various risks presented in the risk report. measures have 
been introduced as far as possible to protect against current and potential risks. delivery hero's 
market position should improve further over the medium term. 
02.  risk report 
the risk report addresses business risks that faced delivery hero group in the 2015 financial year or 
as of the reporting date, and covers a period of at least one year.  
the risks presented below are set out in order of their relevance for the group (gross presentation). 
despite strong sales growth, delivery hero group remains dependent on external financing. for that 
reason, turbulence on the financial markets could have a negative impact on the financing options of 
delivery hero holding gmbh, which finances operations. unanswered questions on the economic and 
institutional stability of the euro zone, the expansive monetary policy of major central banks around the 
world and the unresolved debt problems in numerous industrial and developing countries continue to 
hold significant risk factors. management estimates the risks potentially affecting the company's 
business  from  the  current  political  situation  in  greece  as  being  low.  potential  hyperinflation  in 
argentina represents a substantial risk to business activities there. 
delivery hero holding gmbh secured a considerable amount of finance in 2015 in the context of 
capital increases, allowing the group to fund the business activities of its operating subsidiaries in 
2015. in addition, there are unutilized committed credit lines both at the level of delivery hero 
holding gmbh and at the level of the subsidiaries.  
the ability of the parent company, subsidiaries and group to continue as a going concern will depend 
on the implementation of further measures to secure capital and liquidity by the shareholders in the 
parent company or potential investors. we also refer here to the statements in section 4. b). 
to generate sales, delivery hero essentially relies on the functionality, security and stability of various 
websites, in particular the online ordering platforms. outages and disruptions would lead immediately 
to a loss of sales and would also damage the company's reputation in the medium term. especially 
the many new technologically advanced platforms represent a risk. given the nature of these sensitive 
systems,  even  small  changes  can  trigger  considerable  effects  in  terms  of  error  rates  or  even 
shutdowns. best practice processes are being implemented to an increasing extent in order to prevent 
damage. in addition, internal controls and our staff's it know-how are constantly being expanded. the 
software, developed in-house, is tested as part of a quality assurance process before it is released. to 
defend against external attacks, external service providers and redundant systems are employed, 
among other things, while load tests are run on a regular basis. as part of an incident management 
process,  systematic  searches  for  the  causes  of  disruptions  are  carried  out  and  measures  are 
developed to permanently eliminate these. 
delivery hero group works on a global basis and is subject to the local laws and regulations of the 
countries in which it operates. the operating activities of the respective local subsidiaries could be 
affected by changes in the existing legal framework. furthermore, there are tax risks that may arise 
and can impact the financial situation of the companies. following assessment of the respective 
probabilities of occurrence, provisions were set up for tax risks recognized as liabilities as of the 
reporting date. the actual utilization of these provisions will depend on whether and to what extent the 
risks materialize. 
risks for delivery hero group include ongoing legal disputes resulting from the group's operating 
activity. after assessing the respective probabilities of occurrence, provisions were set up for pending 
 
11 
legal disputes as of the reporting date. the actual utilization of these provisions will depend on 
whether and to what extent the risks materialize. the amount of the provisions for legal disputes is of 
minor importance.  
there is the risk of default for individual claims; for example, in the event of the customer's total or 
partial default. this default risk is minimized by checking the amount of outstanding receivables before 
a new order is accepted by the sales department and by offsetting against the cash collected for the 
customer. in addition, the group is striving to increase the share of online payment, which further 
reduces the risk of default. these measures are employed in an attempt to effectively limit and, where 
possible, further reduce bad debts. management assesses the risk of defaulting debtors as being 
negligible and intends to push further professionalization of the debt collection system. 
risks also arise for the group from fraud in the use of diverse payment options. ordering activities are 
monitored as part of a fraud management system in order to be able to identify and prevent cases of 
fraud. in addition, intensified efforts are being made by the operating units to outsource the risk of 
fraud. for the above reasons, delivery hero group's management assesses the risks from fraud to be 
minor. 
also due to low barriers to market entry, the economic environment remains characterized by fierce 
competition. in addition, restaurant chains such as domino's pizza also offer their own online ordering 
services for their respective products. delivery hero group's objective is to offer end customers the 
best purchasing experience worldwide, with the greatest comfort and widest selection, and thereby 
stand out from the competition. as a consequence, management assumes that the group will continue 
to successfully hold its own on the market despite stiff competition. as delivery hero group was 
among the first market entrants in many markets, the risk of it being squeezed out of the market by 
competitors is assessed as being relatively low. 
the  group  considers  the  risks  connected  with  the  integration  of  acquired  companies  in  the 
consolidated group as relatively low as the operating activities remain largely unchanged in these 
companies and only administrative functions are centralized. 
delivery hero group faces risks from both external developments and internal company processes. 
weakening consumer spending in private households could have a negative impact on the group's 
sales.  however,  in  view  of  the  cautiously  positive  forecasts  for  the  global  economy  in  2016, 
management assesses the risk of a downturn in consumer spending to be low.  
in summary, delivery hero group faces a heightened risk that is common to start-ups. the break-
even point for the group has not yet been achieved, with the result that it relies on external financing. 
as there continues to be considerable potential for growth, even despite skyrocketing sales in the 
past, management assumes that it will be possible to draw upon external financing options until break-
even is reached. it sees itself confirmed in this opinion by the extremely successful capital increases 
at delivery hero holding gmbh in 2015 and early 2016. 
03.  opportunities 
opportunities include business opportunities that present themselves to delivery hero group during 
the year after the reporting date.  
the opportunities presented below are set out in order of their relevance to the group. 
in the field of catering, the home delivery market is regarded along with takeaway as a trend with 
higher than average growth rates. this is true both for developed markets such as germany and for 
emerging countries in latin america, asia-pacific and the middle east. thanks to rigorously aligning 
the business model with customer needs within a growth market, the opportunity to realize increasing 
sales continues to present itself to delivery hero group. the company intends to further raise its 
 
12 
brand  recognition  globally  through  selective  marketing  campaigns,  sponsorship  and  discount 
programs. these marketing activities combined with the best purchasing experience are designed to 
win over new customers and increase the loyalty of existing customers. 
looking forward, the industry is trending towards the delivery of high-quality and fresh meals in 
developed markets in particular. the investment in foodora meant the acquisition of both expertise 
and a strong global brand in this sector. management is convinced that long-term attractive growth 
rates can be achieved in this sector and is therefore accelerating activities in this future market. 
additional synergies can be realized through the joint use of the online platform by multiple companies 
of delivery hero group. an ordering platform is to be progressively developed and maintained 
centrally and filled with local content by the individual companies. by sharing the expenses incurred in 
the development and maintenance of the platform between the individual participating companies of 
delivery hero group, the expenditure for the national subsidiaries will be reduced, an approach that 
represents a clear competitive edge over competitors that do not have a similar platform system.  
synergies also result from the joint use of marketing measures and the global exchange of ideas, to 
the extent that cultural differences in individual regions do not work against this.  
delivery  hero  can  also  create  potential  from  exchanges  within  the  group  between  the  local 
subsidiaries. as a result of this exchange of ideas, delivery hero can identify global trends in the 
business early on and react promptly. the group's acquisitions in the reporting year not only expand 
the options for internal group exchanges, but also provide new drive for innovation. 
additional significant strategic potential can be tapped by further optimizing the liquidity and cash flows 
of the parties involved in the order process by integrating digital payment systems. this approach 
must first overcome major administrative hurdles and regulatory requirements. 
delivery hero group is also responding to the trend towards the increasing use of mobile consumer 
devices, or smartphones. the delivery hero apps will be rigorously developed for various mobile 
operating systems. the group is reporting a steadily increasing number of orders placed by mobile 
consumer devices.  
delivery hero's target group is young and internet savvy. it frequently uses social networks to 
exchange  information.  delivery  hero  is  therefore  increasingly  integrating  these  types  of  social 
networks. in some countries, it is already possible to log in to the ordering process using popular 
social networks, which should simplify the ordering process. this will also further improve delivery 
hero's brand recognition. 
in summary, delivery hero has the opportunity to participate in global trends, such as increasing 
networking, the use of apps on smartphones and changing eating habits. the growth of the global 
business activities will be supported by professional structures in it and back office. 
e.  use of financial instruments 
01.  risk management 
delivery hero group faces default risks, liquidity risks and market risks, in particular interest rate and 
foreign exchange risks, due to the use of financial instruments. delivery hero actively monitors these 
risks and manages them using an effective risk management system. the risk management function 
is integrated in group controlling.  
 
13 
02.  liquidity risk 
strong external growth means delivery hero group has to rely on external financing to ensure 
sufficient liquidity. a lack of external financing could threaten the group's ability to continue as a going 
concern. through proper budget planning, delivery hero group's liquidity management makes sure 
that sufficient funds are available. furthermore, a constantly secured and adequate amount of cash 
and cash equivalents ensures that operations can be financed. unused credit lines are also available.  
03.  market risk 
through its foreign subsidiaries, delivery hero group generates a significant portion of its revenue in 
foreign currencies. in order to reduce the foreign exchange risk, delivery hero group generally tries to 
generate income and incur expenses in the same functional currency. in addition, delivery hero 
group's investments in foreign subsidiaries means it is exposed to foreign exchange risks when 
converting the value of net assets. however, this is not a foreign exchange risk as defined by ifrs 7.  
the loans taken out by the group contain, to a certain extent, variable interest on the basis of 
reference interest rates. a change in market interest rates may result in an increase in future interest 
payable which would have a negative effect on the company's financial performance. for the forecast 
period, the company sees the risk of an interest rate hike as low, however expects interest to increase 
over the medium-term. in the course of its risk management system, the dh group monitors market 
developments and, if necessary, will limit interest rate risks with appropriate derivative financial 
instruments. 
the credit or default risk is the risk that the business partners, mainly restaurants, are unable to fulfill 
their payment obligations, which would mean delivery hero group incurs a loss. such risks mainly 
involve current trade receivables. delivery hero group is not exposed to a major default risk from any 
single individual customer. the concentration of the creditworthiness risk is limited due to the broad 
and heterogeneous customer base. delivery hero group monitors the default risk and manages this 
actively by making any necessary credit checks and optimizing the payment process. consequently, 
the risk is largely transferred to the restaurants (also by way of an effective debt collection system). 
the maximum default risk corresponds to the carrying amount of the financial assets.
