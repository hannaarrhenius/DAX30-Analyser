a. group profile
01 business model
the delivery hero group (also referred to as delivery hero, group or company) provides online food ordering 
services in over 40 countries on six continents. with its services in the online food ordering and online food de-
livery sectors, it operates in various countries of europe, latin and south america, asia, africa, north america 
and australia.
over the last few years, delivery hero has expanded strongly on the basis of external company acquisitions. 
thus in the 2015 financial year, the group acquired the yemeksepeti group in turkey. as a result, delivery hero 
is now represented in the largest food delivery market in mena. with its acquisition of the foodpanda group 
in december 2016, delivery hero expanded its presence on a global basis. in the process, the portfolio was 
expanded with 8 eastern european countries, the geographic footprint considerably extended in various young 
asian markets, and also widened in saudi arabia, the united arab emirates and egypt.
the delivery hero internet platforms are aligned to the local requirements of their customers who choose 
from a wide range of delivery services in their region and can look at and order from their menus. orders can 
be made by app or via the website and subsequently paid either in cash or on non-cash basis. as an option, 
delivery hero offers the catering businesses a delivery and point of sale system in order to immediately view 
and accept orders made on the platform. in addition, delivery hero offers products and services for catering 
businesses, such as food packaging, as well as advertising and printing services. in addition to the online food 
ordering sector, with some of its platforms such as foodora, foodpanda and additional brands, the group also 
offers delivery of the food to customers. the driver fleet is coordinated using proprietary dispatch software.
delivery hero generates a large portion of its revenue on the basis of orders made. these commissions are 
based on a contractually specified percentage of the order value. the percentage varies depending on country, 
type of restaurant and the services provided, as for example the use of a point of sale system, last mile delivery 
and marketing support. the point of sale system allows catering businesses to immediately view and accept 
orders made on the platform.
in addition to commissions, delivery hero generates additional revenue, e.g. with premium placements. premi-
um placement means that for a fee restaurants are ranked first among all the listed suppliers in their relevant 
delivery area. additional revenue is also generated by advertising campaigns. delivery hero also generates 
revenue on the basis of delivery fees by oncharging transaction fees, such as credit card fees or fees from on-
line payment systems when a charge is levied in certain markets. a small share of total commissions relates to 
standing charges received.
the parent company delivery hero gmbh (also referred to as dh) was founded with its headquarters in berlin 
in 2011 and has since expanded its presence worldwide on local markets with various brands. after various 
acquisitions between 2014 and 2016, as of the reporting date the global scope of consolidation of the delivery 
hero group was made up of a total of 136 companies (previous year: 106 companies). for further details, refer 
to chapter 2.c) of the report on the business situation. delivery hero exercises either direct or indirect control 
over all subsidiaries.

a. group profile | 01 business model / 02 segments
the delivery hero group is managed by delivery hero gmbh (previously: delivery hero holding gmbh) which 
is headquartered in berlin, germany. alongside the management of the group, delivery hero gmbh assumes a 
range of it, marketing and other services, in particular commercial and technical consultancy services. in additi-
on, as group holding delivery hero gmbh assumes functions such as group controlling and accounting, public 
relations, investor relations, risk management and human resources management.
the management of the delivery hero group uses data of the regional companies in order to develop global 
corporate strategy, plan and optimize global marketing, coordinate the network of local brands as well as to 
identify and implement best practices. delivery hero supports the local companies in implementing new pro-
cesses and products on the respective markets. to a large extent, the subsidiaries are managed by the founders 
and thus have a comprehensive insight into and knowledge about their markets and their cultures. the subsi-
diaries implement the global strategy on a local basis and have the primary responsibility for the performance 
of their own brands. the companies within the delivery hero group use innovative and scalable technologies 
to create a highly transparent order and delivery process for restaurants, customers and drivers.
with financing rounds, delivery hero gmbh procures the capital to finance the equity and debt needed to 
finance the expansion of the operating business. this financing is made either directly in the operating com-
panies or indirectly via an interim holding. delivery hero gmbh is headed by a managing director with direct 
reports from further persons as executives for the areas of strategy, finance, marketing, operations and infor-
mation technology. furthermore, the management is monitored by an advisory board.
the reporting of the business situation of the delivery hero group corresponds in principle to that of the 
reporting for delivery hero gmbh. additional information on the single-entity financial statements is provided 
in chapter e “supplementary business situation reporting on the single-entity financial statements of delivery 
hero gmbh”.

mena
operating activities in the mena segment (including the business of the foodpanda group) make a significant 
contribution to the number of orders and the gross merchandise volume (gmv) of the group. in the mena 
segment, delivery hero is represented in the markets of bahrain, jordan, kuwait, oman, qatar, saudi arabia, 
united arab emirates, turkey and egypt with brands such as yemeksepeti, talabat, foodonclick, hungerstation, 
hellofood and otlob.
in turkey, the largest food delivery market in the mena segment, the group is represented with the yemek-
sepeti brand. yemeksepeti was founded in 2001 and has been part of the delivery hero group since 2015. 
yemeksepeti is the market leader in the online food takeaway segment in turkey, currently listing more than 
10,000 restaurants in turkey on its platform.
in addition to turkey, with the talabat brand the group is represented in bahrain, jordan, kuwait, oman, qatar, 
saudi arabia and the united arab emirates. in addition, as a result of the foodpanda acquisition, the otlob 
brand, which was started in 1999, belongs to the delivery hero group. otlob is the market leader in egypt and 
one of the oldest e-commerce platforms in the near east. foodpanda also operates with the brands foodpanda 
and 24h in the united arab emirates and is the market leader in saudi arabia with hellofood and hungerstation.
asia
the group has a significant presence in south korea. in south korea the group operates the yogiyo and baedal-
tong brands. while yogiyo is a classical website for online food ordering, baedaltong operates in the click-to-
call business. this is designed like an industry directory for restaurants. via a button on the website, it connects 
customers directly with the restaurant. in the reporting year, business in australia has been brought together 
under the foodora brand.
the acquisition of foodpanda significantly expands the geographical footprint of the delivery hero group in 
asia, allowing access to the growth potential of various young markets such as bangladesh, brunei, hong kong, 
india, malaysia, pakistan, the philippines, singapore, taiwan and thailand.
americas
in the americas segment over 10 geographical markets are part of the delivery hero portfolio, including cana-
da, where the group is represented with the foodora brand. in latin america, delivery hero operates primarily 
the brands pedidosya and clickdelivery, which have been part of the group since 2014. pedidosya was founded 
in 2008 and connects customers and restaurants in argentina, brazil, chile, panama, paraguay and uruguay. 
clickdelivery operates in columbia, ecuador and peru. overall, the latin american countries have considerable 
growth potential, something which also includes the online food market.

a. group profile | 03 management system / 04 research and development
03 management system
revenue and adjusted ebitda are the key financial indicators for corporate management. in addition to the key 
financial indicators, non-financial indicators are also used to manage the company. these are described in more 
detail in chapter b.02.e) “financial and non-financial performance indicators”.
04 research and development
most of the employees in it work not only in ensuring smooth operations, but also in further developing the 
order platforms deployed within the delivery hero group on the respective sales markets. these platforms 
are the key resource for generating revenue across the delivery hero group. high priority is also given to the 
protection of personal data, security of data and ensuring the protection and scalability of the technology and 
it infrastructure. delivery hero also cooperates with external partners here.
in the area of research and development, delivery hero attaches particular importance in providing the user 
a comfortable, reliable and secure order platform. also to be covered is the transformation to the increased 
use of mobile applications. in addition, the development process aims to further push standardization across 
business operations combined with the automation of business processes. furthermore, delivery hero intends 
to advance the innovation process in order to market services via additional sales channels, such as smart tvs.
due to it being difficult to demarcate activities such as maintenance, securing operational availability, ongoing 
and new development as well as the continuous improvement of the systems, it is not possible to make a quan-
titative separation of the individual areas. the key structures and the contents of the research and development 
work in the delivery hero group have not changed in comparison to the previous year.
total expenses across the group for the it department were keur 31,337 (previous year: keur 19,788). this 
corresponds to 10.6% of revenue in 2016. due to the organization of product, development, maintenance and 
design work within the it department, a precise allocation of employee figures is currently not possible. it is 
thus not possible to break down the total expenditure by research and development activities. development 
costs are not capitalized. due to limited human resources capacity and the large number of new developments, 
third parties are also mandated in respect to development services.

for the past reporting year, the international monetary fund forecast 3.1% growth for the global economy, 
slightly below the expectations for the previous year (3.2%)01. the generally difficult year for the global eco-
nomy was marked by a higher level of political uncertainty, stagnating global trade combined with restrained 
investment expenditure, thus posting a weaker development than had been anticipated.02 03

with expected growth of 1.7% in 2016, the eurozone also generated lower growth than the 2.0% achieved in 
the previous year04. this was due to the fact that momentum slowed in respect to domestic consumption and 
exports05. in the emerging and developing countries, unchanged growth of 4.1% was forecast.06
for 2016, there was moderate growth for the most important markets in europe in which delivery hero opera-
ted. in germany, year-on-year price-adjusted gross domestic product growth was 1.8%. finland at 1.6% and the 
united kingdom with 1.8% achieved similar growth rates. only sweden at 3.1% is growing considerably more 
strongly than the eurozone countries.07

in asia and australia growth in comparison to the previous year remained essentially unchanged. thus gross 
domestic product growth was 6.8% in the philippines, 3.2% in thailand, 4.3% in malaysia, 2.7% in south korea 
and 2.3% in australia.08
in the latin american markets, there was a mixed picture for economic development in 2016. while countries 
such as peru and columbia increased strongly at 3.9% and 2.0% respectively, internal political difficulties took 
a considerable toll in brazil where gross domestic product declined by 3.6%.08 in argentina gross domestic pro-
duct also moved downwards (by 2.3%).09 growth in countries of the gulf cooperation council (gcc), which lar-
gely corresponds to the markets in which delivery hero operates, was 1.7%, much lower than the figure of the 
previous year (3.4%), while the mena region posted growth of 3.2% (previous year: 2.1%).10 after the strong 
trend in 2015, growth in turkey slowed. the country achieved a growth rate of 2.7% (previous year: 4.0%)11.  
in the european markets particularly relevant for the delivery hero group, price-adjusted private consumer 
spending developed in line with economic growth. for example, in germany it rose by 2.0% compared to the 
previous year.12 in the eurozone, consumer spending of private households rose even more strongly, by 2.6%  
in comparison to the previous year.13
in each individual market, there are frequently strong competitors. key competitors in europe are the takea-
way group, netherlands, with its brand lieferando.de in germany, just eat in great britain, belgium, italy, the 
netherlands, norway or switzerland and the british deliveroo group in european countries such as the nether-
lands, france, germany, spain and italy. deliveroo also operates in asia in hong kong and singapore, as well as 
in mena in the united arab emirates. via its subsidiary ubereats, the us group uber also entered the market 
in various large european and asian cities.
in mena, in may 2016 the carriage platform was launched on the market. it is operated by the kuwait-based 
carriage logistics general trading company. a key competitor of carriage is talabat. other important compe-
titors in mena are deliveroo and zomato in the united arab emirates. the largest competitors in asia include 
baedal minjeok in south korea.
on a global basis, the market for online food orders is intensely competitive. the key target group is house-
holds with medium and high incomes. in addition, restaurant chains are increasingly offering online order 
services for their products. however, in many countries delivery hero has been able to establish a dominant po-
sition, which it further expanded in this financial year. from the group’s perspective, there are three important 
global trends which impact and accelerate the growth and size of the online food delivery markets. these are 
the increasing number of people who order prepared food instead of cooking themselves, the sustained trend 
of having products delivered “on-demand” to the home or the workplace and a general behavioral change 
away from offline processes to online among consumers. these three trends influence both the size and the 
growth of the online food delivery market on a sustained basis.

02 business performance
a) revenue
in 2016, delivery hero continued its strong growth in its core business. revenue (without discontinued opera-
tions) at keur 297,02614 (previous year: keur 166,157) was 79% up on the previous year. contributory factors 
included the 2015 acquisitions of the yemek and talabat groups (which were included on a full-year basis in 
the consolidated financial statements for the first time) and growth at foodora. thus the 60% revenue upturn 
forecast (after adjustment for currency effects) was exceeded.
the organic growth was driven primarily by new users and the resulting rise in the number of orders.
b) financing measures
key financing measures in the 2016 financial year were taking up loans. thus at the beginning of the financial 
year, the group was provided a long-term loan of eur 120 million. as a result, the group was able to pay back 
a loan which had a higher interest rate. furthermore, delivery hero was provided with further loans to finance 
growth by a partner. these are also long term.
14  unless otherwise stated, all figures have been rounded to the nearest eur thousand (keur).  
  for computational reasons, there may be rounding differences to the exact mathematical values  
  in tables and references.

c) acquisitions
in december 2016, delivery hero made a full acquisition in emerging markets online food delivery holding 
s.á.r.l. (also referred to as emo food group or foodpanda group) headquartered in luxembourg and subsidiari-
es in the context of a non-cash capital increase.
the emo food group acquisition results in material changes to the group’s financial performance and finan-
cial position. as part of the transaction, cash and cash equivalents of eur 132.4 million were acquired. the 
acquisition of the foodpanda companies considerably increased user figures as well as the number of restau-
rants connected across the group as of the reporting date. as a result of the intangible assets acquired, group 
non-current assets surged. in the acquisition the focus was the global strategic positioning. as a result of the 
acquisition of the foodpanda group, companies in an additional 20 countries extend the geographical portfolio 
at delivery hero.
d) discontinued operations
in december 2016, delivery hero announced the planned transaction with just eat plc on the disposal of the 
hungryhouse group and made a contractual agreement on the matter. as a result, the hungryhouse group is 
reported separately under discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. the sale of the 
hungryhouse group is subject to the necessary anti-trust approval by the united kingdom’s competition and 
markets authority (cma). delivery hero anticipates that approval will be granted during the course of the 2017 
financial year.
according to the agreement concluded, the sale price comprises a fixed purchase price component of 
gbp 200 million payable in cash and a contingent purchase price component of between gbp -30 million up 
to gbp +40 million payable in cash. the payment of the contingent purchase price component depends on the 
financial performance of the hungryhouse group in the period between the conclusion of the purchase agree-
ment and the closing of the transaction.
e) financial and non-financial performance indicators
revenue is an important financial indicator for delivery hero. this reflects the possibility for service sales on 
the markets and makes it possible to determine the group’s competitive position. another key financial per-
formance indicator used for management purposes is adjusted ebitda at the level of the subsidiaries and at 
group level. for the definition of adjusted ebitda, please refer to the comments below and the explanations in 
section c.01.b).

in the 2016 financial year, the number of orders increased year on year by 65.2%, or almost 68 million orders. 
thus the forecast which indicated a growth upturn exceeding 30%, was easily surpassed, due largely to  
acquisitions.

f) business development
higher revenue is due primarily to the strong rise in the number of orders, both from new and from existing 
customers. intensified marketing and sales activities also made a positive contribution to this trend. alongside 
classical advertising, such as television spots and online advertising, marketing cooperations were entered into 
so as to position the respective brands on the local markets in a way to garner publicity. in addition, continuous 
improvements in products and processes resulted in a better customer experience. this resulted in stable, even 
increased repeat buying rates, making a material contribution to the growth of the delivery hero group.
in the reporting year, it was particularly the delivery and sales segments at delivery hero which were rein-
forced. in the wake of the rapid growth at the operating country companies, the it department was again 
strengthened to create structures for further growth from operating business. furthermore, in the country 
companies, processes were analyzed with the objective of finding optimization potential. in the customer 
services area, ongoing investments in excellent customer support were made globally. in addition, as a result 
of an improved exchange between the group holding and the respective country companies, synergies were 
discovered and leveraged. this will impact positively on the future customer experience.
against the background of the strong organic revenue growth in 2016, it is the management’s opinion that bu-
siness developed favorably. the management feels that the positive operating trend reinforces its view that the 
services of the delivery hero group represent an attractive product on a global basis for which there remains 
high demand potential.

03 employees
the average number of employees increased from 2,843 in 2015 to 6,848 in 2016.
by individual functional area, the situation is as follows: 
 
functional area 2016 2015 change
delivery 3,698 432 756 %
marketing & sales 1,875 1,573 19 %
it  449 401 12 %
management 73 59 24 %
general administration 753 378 99 %
total 6,848 2,843 141 %
this increase which occurred primarily in the delivery, sales and general administration segments was a result 
of the company acquisitions that were reported on a full-year basis for the first time in the reporting year and 
the expansion of the delivery business under the foodora brand in the reporting year. in addition, operating 
activities were expanded across the group, something that was continued in 2016. as of december 31, 2016, 
the group employed 9,209 staff (previous year: 5,170).

in the financial year, revenue of the delivery hero group increased by keur 130,869. growth was driven prima-
rily by organic growth. the reason for this revenue upturn is the significantly increasing number of food orders 
via the online platforms. the number of orders rose from 103.3 million in 2015 to 170.7 million in the reporting 
year. key revenue positions were commissions (keur 217,265), premium placements (keur 29,893) and delivery 
fees (keur 15,934). an analysis of revenue from a geographical perspective shows that a large portion of re-
venue was generated in germany (keur 72,667), followed by korea (keur 40,830) and turkey (keur 39,757).
an assessment at segment level shows higher revenue of keur 48,877 in europe, of keur 45,047 in mena, of 
keur 17,235 in asia and of keur 13,401 in the americas. the key revenue drivers are the regions europe at 
keur 140,508 and mena at keur 75,539.
cost of sales rose by keur 54,974, more quickly than revenue. the trend resulted chiefly from the rise in de-
livery costs due to expanding the delivery business by keur 40,729. this was due to the strong growth of the 
foodora group which was consolidated for a full-year basis for the first time in 2016.

b. report on the business situation | 04 business situation
of the increase in selling expenses, keur 22,050 relates to marketing expenses and keur 11,549 to it expenses. 
the strongest impact on selling expenses were costs for tv and radio advertising with a share of keur 108,255 
(previous year: keur 119,241) and expenses in relation to acquiring restaurants of keur 56,186 (previous year: 
keur 34,281). the it expenses of keur 22,364 (previous year: keur 16,753) relate primarily to staff costs gene-
rated in connection with the further development of order platforms.
administrative expenses of keur 100,898 were largely in line with the previous year (keur 107,895). the 
decline in expenses relating to share-based payment offset the increase in other personnel expenses, in rent 
and leasing expenses and in expenses for other taxes.
while other operating income was at the level of the previous year, other operating expenses increased from 
keur 8,630 in the previous year to keur 19,920 in the reporting year. the increase in other operating expenses 
resulted mainly from the write-down on the goodwill of delivery hero germany gmbh.
depreciation and amortization relate primarily to depreciation on intangible assets such as brands and custo-
mer relationships, acquired in the context of company acquisitions over the last few financial years as well as 
depreciation on property, plant and equipment. the increase in depreciation and amortization results mainly 
from the full-year recording of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets acquired during the previous 
year.
for the impact of exchange rates, please refer to chapter i.02.e) of the notes to the financial statements.
the negative adjusted ebitda of the reporting segments improved against the previous year by 34.6% to keur 
-71,202 (previous year: keur -108,799). as a result of the ongoing growth strategy, particularly in the area of the 
foodora group, in the reporting period negative adjusted ebitda of the europe segment increased by 85.3% to 
keur -47,543 (previous year: keur -25,662), while adjusted ebitda in the mena segment mena improved by 
keur 21,690 to keur 21,186 (previous year: keur -504). the positive development in the mena segment was 
the result primarily of the platform business of the yemeksepeti and talabat brands. in the asia and americas 
segments, negative adjusted ebitda improved by 47.9% and 41.6% respectively to keur -27,952 (previous year: 
keur -53,692) and keur -16,893 (previous year: keur -28,942). for further information on adjusted ebitda,

the financial position of the group is shown on the basis of the following condensed statement of cash flows:
keur 2016 2015
cash and cash equivalents at the beginning  
160,150 32,829
of the financial year
cash flow from operating activities -95,986 -146,866

the end of the financial year
the negative cash flow from operating activities results primarily in cash flow from operating business as a 
result of the high marketing investments and higher current assets due to the group’s strong growth.
cash flow from investing activities in 2016 mainly comprises the acquisitions presented in section d.2 of the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements and investments in intangible assets (such as software licenses) 
and property, plant and equipment. due to the business model, investment activity in property, plant and 
equipment across the group is relatively low, as capital is invested primarily in intangible assets. investments in 
the context of company acquisitions relate primarily to the cash and cash equivalents acquired (keur 132,444) 
where the non-cash components offset the consideration made.
in 2016, cash flow from financing activities reflects primarily payments from borrowings taken up. these mea-
sures contributed to securing the financing of operating activities in the delivery hero group.
the capital structure of the group is made up of equity amounting to keur 892,208 (previous year: keur 
765,492), as well as non-current and current liabilities of keur 502,690 (previous year: keur 443,239) and keur 
237,252 (previous year: keur 180,714). of the trade payables and other liabilities keur 127,792 (previous year: 
keur 111,180) relate to current liabilities and keur 264,958 (previous year: keur 295,574) to non-current 
liabilities. to the end of the financial year, there were non-current liabilities to banks of keur 116,403 (previous 
year: keur 0), which were taken up to repay a loan which had a higher interest rate. the loan has a variable 
interest rate and has been extended in euro. for further information on the capital structure, please refer to the 
comments on the financial performance in chapter b.04.c.).
in 2016, the solvency of the parent company and the subsidiary was ensured at all times, particularly as a result 
of payments by the partners in the context of loans extended and by taking up a bank loan.

01. combined 02. consolidated 03. notes to the consolidated
management report financial statements financial statements
b. report on the business situation | 04 business situation
in 2018, loan liabilities to various lenders totaling keur 272,975 are due for payment.
part of the loan repayment is to come from the purchase price payment for the planned disposal of the invest-
ment in the hungryhouse group. this sale is conditional on the approval of the united kingdom’s competition 
and markets authority (cma).
if the anti-trust authorities do not grant their approval, the management is of the opinion that the partners or 
further potential investors or other providers of capital will provide the liquid assets required for continuing 
the parent company, the subsidiaries and thus the group, especially for the repayment of loans and thus is 
accounting on a going concern basis.
the continuation of the operating activities of the group and the parent company and subsidiaries on a going 
concern basis thus depends on implementing further measures to secure capital and equity by the partners, po-
tential investors or other providers of capital. furthermore, the recoverability of the reported goodwill depends 
on the occurrence of the underlying assumptions made in respect to revenue and ebitda growth.
as of the reporting date, the cash and cash equivalents reported are not subject to any material restrictions on 
disposal. due to local currency controls in argentina, transferring capital to other countries may be restricted.
as of december 31, 2016, there are unutilized credit facilities provided by third parties of keur 25,000 (previous 
year: 0).

b. report on the business situation | 04 business situation
group gross assets increased by 17%, largely due to acquisitions. financing for the additional assets was  
provided largely by equity contributed in the wake of the transfer of the foodpanda group. 
the chief element of gross assets remains non-current assets, which in turn are largely intangible assets. as of 
the reporting date, the key intangible assets related to goodwill at keur 702,214 (previous year: keur 519,558) 
to brands at keur 437,001 (previous year: keur 489,845) and to customer and supplier relationships at 
keur 148,047 (previous year: keur 146,140). in 2016, investments in property, plant and equipment amounted 
to keur 9,297 (previous year: keur 5,024).
in 2016, the considerable increase in current assets of keur 138,866 was driven largely by an expansion of 
operating activities and the resulting rise of current accounts receivable and the inflow of cash and cash 
equivalents in the wake of the foodpanda group acquisition. the increase in cash and cash equivalents by 
keur 70,703 resulted in current assets moving higher.
the equity and liabilities side now is made up of equity and primarily of non-current loans. current liabilities 
make up only 15% (previous year: 13%) of the consolidated balance sheet total. primarily as a result of the non-
cash capital increase as part of the acquisition of the foodpanda group, equity increased 2016 by keur 378,658. 
the negative consolidated comprehensive income of keur -256,519 (previous year: keur -287,168), partially 
offset this increase. in the reporting year, the equity ratio remained stable at 55%. as of the reporting date, 
keur 9,607 of the equity relates to non-controlling interests.
as of the reporting date, non-current liabilities relate primarily to deferred tax liabilities keur 108,061 (previ-
ous year: keur 138,671), which can be largely allocated to the intangible assets acquired in the course of com-
pany acquisitions and loans of keur 347,162 (previous year: keur 266,556), provided in the course of company 
acquisitions and to finance general business operations. at the beginning of the reporting year, the delivery 
hero group was provided long-term financing of keur 120,000 by a banking consortium which was used to 
repay existing loans on which higher interest was paid.
the increase in current liabilities is due primarily to the higher level of operating activities.

d) overall assessment
in summary, the management assesses the financial position, financial performance and earnings situation as 
positive and in view of the considerable expansion in the reporting year in line with expectations. as a result 
of the acquisition made in the reporting year, the dh group considerably improved its financial performance. 
in addition, on april 1, the company announced a regional partnership with amrest holding se, the largest 
publicly traded restaurant operator in central europe. this cooperation will allow delivery hero to integrate the 
most popular restaurants and brands of amrest in poland and the brands in the czech republic and hungary 
into its own food delivery platforms.
due to expanding business and fierce competition in many markets, the group is still generating losses. howe-
ver, due to the growth strategy this is as indicated in the budget planning. as of the reporting date, the group 
had considerable equity and its equity ratio was stable, almost unchanged to the previous year.
revenue increased in the reporting year by 79%, driven primarily by the high number of orders. as a result, 
despite negative currency effects, the increase was well over the anticipated 60% (after adjustment for currency 
effects). this also includes the non-organic revenue growth from the company acquisitions made in 2015.
the delivery hero group also achieved its objective of further improving ebitda. however, at keur -106,914, it 
was outside the forecast corridor in the reporting year

a) future general business and industry situation
for the global economy an increase of gross domestic product of 3.5% is anticipated for 2017 (after 2.9% in 
2016).15 despite new political uncertainties, a moderate risk in global gdp is expected. in the advanced econo-
mies, the economy is gaining momentum. overall, the expansion contribution of emerging countries is rising, 
even though structural problems remain. important risks for the global economy remain an economic slump in 
the chinese economy and the massive monetary expansion policies of various central banks.16
for germany, the german institute for economic research has increased its forecast for 2017 to 1.4%, basing 
this on the ongoing upturn in employment. on the other hand, higher inflation impacts private consumption 
negatively.
for the european union, moderate expansion of 1.9% is forecast for 2017. after the decision to exit the eu, 
the economy in the united kingdom has not slowed as had been expected. in the other countries of the eu, a 
strong economic development overall is anticipated.17
in the south-east asian emerging countries, expansion is stable overall. for this reason, a strong growth level 
of 6.2% is expected, as was the case in the previous year. after two years of recession, the economy in latin 
america is recovering only slowly. for 2017, growth of 0.7% is forecast. within this group, growth of 2.5%, 2.2% 
and 3.8% is expected for argentina, columbia and peru respectively, while in brazil gross domestic product is 
slated to contract by 0.7%.18
for the countries of the gulf cooperation council (gcc), growth of 2.3% is anticipated for 2017, while for mena 
growth of 3.2% is being forecast.19 for turkey in 2017, the anticipation remains of moderate growth amounting 
to 2.9%.20 
over the course of the next few years, it is anticipated that the global market for food delivery services will con-
tinue to achieve average annual growth of 3.6%.21 the key drivers of this trend are increasing urbanization, a 
further increase in the number of households with medium income levels and rising consumer spending. what 
is more, the ongoing increase of internet penetration is a factor driving further growth for the market of online 
delivery service relevant for delivery hero. currently the global market for food delivery services breaks down 
across the regions of asia and the middle east at approximately 37%, europe at roughly 32%, north america at 
23% and latin america with some 7%, but with expected market growth of 4.2% has the highest growth rates.22 
a sub-area of the market for food delivery services is the market for internet food delivery services.

here orders are made online using specially established order platforms. for this comparably young market 
segment, the group expects higher growth rates than for the classical delivery market of telephone orders.
b)future development of the group
for the 2017 financial year, the management of the delivery hero group anticipates that both the number of 
orders and the number of connected restaurants will increase further. in 2017, these increases will be under-
pinned by ongoing promotion with concentrated marketing measures, targeting not only continuous use of the 
order platform by existing customers but also generating new customers. thus the objective for 2017 is to 
increase the number of orders by more than 30% in comparison to the previous year. the number of restau-
rants connected on the platforms (restaurants online) is set to be increased slightly in 2017, thus supporting the 
number of orders and thus revenue growth.
in the wake of these measures, for the 2017 financial year the management anticipates a considerable revenue 
upturn (adjusted for reporting the hungryhouse group as discontinued operations). alongside organic growth 
within the group, this increase should also be fueled by the acquisition of the foodpanda group which took 
place at the end of 2016.
for the 2017 financial year, the management anticipates that a considerable decline of the negative adjusted 
ebitda will be achieved. adjusted ebitda the earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, 
finance income/costs, depreciation and amortization and non-operating earnings effects. non-operating 
earnings effects comprise particularly (i) expenses for share-based payment, (ii) expenses for services in 
connection with corporate transactions and financing rounds, reorganization measures, the implementation of 
information technology and the achievement of capital market viability and (iii) other non-operating expenses 
and income, especially the net result from the disposal of fixed assets, the net result from the sale and 
discontinuation of subsidiaries, impairment on other receivables and non-income taxes. as the corresponding 
adjustment effects are not subject to planning, the (non-adjusted) ebitda and thus profits (determined in line 
with the accounting guidelines of the company) cannot be calculated. in addition, the anticipated adjusted 
ebitda is to be adjusted for the effects of the discontinued operations of the hungryhouse group.
to the end of the 2016 financial year, the scope of consolidation changed considerably in comparison to the 
previous year as a result of the acquisition of the foodpanda group and will also change in 2017 on the basis of 
the planned disposal of the hungryhouse group which is currently subject to the decision from the cma. at this 
moment in time, it cannot be assessed how the integration of the foodpanda group will impact the earnings 
trend in the group. over the next few years, the companies of the foodpanda group will make a material 
contribution to revenue across the delivery hero group. due to ongoing investments on the part of the 
subsidiaries, a negative contribution to the group’s earnings position is expected for the next financial year. 
both the acquisition of the foodpanda group and the planned disposal of the hungryhouse group can impact 
adjusted ebitda - in a positive and a negative fashion.

due to the comparatively short company history of the group and the fact that delivery hero is operating in a 
relatively new market, any forecast on the earnings trend is subject to considerable uncertainty. adjusted 
ebitda is dependent not only on factors that can be impacted by delivery hero, but also by those over which it 
has no influence. for example, if the group were forced to defend its position against new competitors in 
specific markets or to react to revenue downturns, then measures which may not have been scheduled 
previously may have to be implemented (e.g. increasing marketing expenditure) which can result in a negative 
development of adjusted ebitda which deviates considerably from the previous estimate.
c) overall assessment from the management
overall, the development of business for the 2016 financial year and the general situation are regarded as 
positive. the delivery hero group achieved its growth targets and considerably strengthened its capital basis, 
meaning that the group is also in a position to finance future growth.
the assumptions on the economic development of the market and the industry are based on assessments 
which the management of the delivery hero group considers realistic in line with currently available informa-
tion. however, these estimates are subject to uncertainly and bring with them the unavoidable risk that the 
forecasts do not occur, either in terms of direction or in relation to extent. the forecast for the forecast period 
is based on the composition of the group at the time the financial statements were prepared.
the activities of delivery hero are subject to various risks which are described in the risk report. as far as 
possible, measures are taken to provide protection against current and potential risks. in the medium term, it is 
expected that the market position of delivery hero will be further strengthened.
02 risk report
the risk report deals with the business risks which the delivery hero group considered itself exposed to in the 
2016 financial year and at the reporting date and covers a period of at least one year.
the risks in the following report are shown in the order of their impact on the group (gross impact).
despite its strong growth, the delivery hero group still depends on external funding. for this reason, turbulen-
ce on financial markets could impact negatively on the financial possibilities of delivery hero gmbh in respect 
to its operating activities. open questions on the economic and institutional stabilization of the eurozone, the 
expansive monetary policy of large central banks worldwide and the unresolved debt problems in numerous 
industrial and developing countries result in considerable risks. what is more, business operations in argentina 
represent a not inconsiderable risk in respect to potential hyperinflation. however, the management assesses 
the risks to the business of the company from the current political situation in turkey as low.
in 2016, delivery hero gmbh secured funding in the context of capital increases, thus making it possible 
to finance the operating activities of the operating subsidiaries in 2016. in addition, a long-term financing 
agreement was concluded with an international banking consortium making it possible to repay higher interest 
liabilities. furthermore, there are unutilized credit facilities at the level of delivery hero gmbh.

c. outlook, opportunities and risks | 02 risk report
the continuation of the parent company, the subsidiaries and the group on a going concern basis depends on 
implementing further measures to secure capital and equity by the partners of the parent company, potential 
investors or other providers of capital. for more information on this, refer to the comments in chapter b.04.b).
to generate revenue, delivery hero is strongly dependent on the functionality, security and stability of various 
websites, in particular, online order platforms. downtimes and disruptions, e.g. caused by hacker attacks would 
result directly in lost sales, and in the medium term damage the reputation of the company. risks are posed 
here particularly from the numerous platforms developed with a high level of technology. even small changes 
to their sensitive systems could impact considerably in terms of higher error rates or even result in downtime. 
to avoid damage, best practice processes are increasingly being used. what is more, internal controls and 
employee it expertise are being extended. before publication, proprietary software is examined in the context 
of a quality assurance process. methods used to provide defense against external attacks include the use of 
external service providers, redundant systems and regular stress tests. within an incident management process, 
a systematic search is made for the causes of malfunctions and measures are worked on to ensure they are 
permanently rectified.
the delivery hero group operates on a global basis and is subject to respective national legislation and regula-
tions. changes to the existing legal situation could impact the operating activities of the relevant country com-
panies. in addition, there are also tax risks which could impact the financial situation of the companies. for the 
tax risks for which liabilities must be reported as of the reporting date, provisions were established, taking into 
account the assessment of the respective probability of occurrence. the actual utilization of these provisions 
depends on whether, and to what extent, the risks materialize.
there are risks for the delivery hero group resulting from expected legal disputes from the group’s operating 
activities. for the legal disputes pending as of the reporting date, provisions were established, taking into 
account the assessment of the respective probability of occurrence. the actual utilization of these provisions 
depends on whether, and to what extent, the risks materialize. the level of provisions for legal disputes is of 
subordinate importance.
for individual receivables there is a default risk, for example, if a customer fully or partially defaults. this de-
fault risk is minimized by controlling the level of receivables before sales accepts a new order and by offsetting 
the cash accepted on behalf of the customer. in addition, the group is endeavoring to increase the share of 
online payments, further reducing the default risk. this measure is used to limit the level of onerous contracts 
and to reduce them further if possible. the management considers the result of a default on receivables as low 
and wants to advance the level of professionalism in the dunning system.
for the group, risks also result from fraud with various payment options. in the context of fraud management, 
order activities are monitored in order to identify and prevent cases of fraud. in addition, at the operating units 
increased efforts are being made to outsource the fraud risk. for the above reasons, the management of the 
delivery hero group assesses the risks from fraud as low.
the industry environment continues to be marked by a high level of competition, also due to low barriers 
to market entry. in addition, restaurant chains such as domino’s pizza are increasingly offering online order 
services for their products. the delivery hero group tries to offer its end customers across the globe the best 
buying experience with the highest level of convenience and the greatest choice, thus differentiating itself 
from the competition. consequently, the management anticipates that the group can assert its position suc-
cessfully on the market, despite the strong competition. as the delivery hero group was one of the first movers 
in many markets, the risk of predatory competition is assessed as relatively low.

01. combined 02. consolidated 03. notes to the consolidated

c. outlook, opportunities and risks | 02 risk report / 03 opportunity report
the group assesses the risk from integrating purchased companies into the group as relatively low, as the ope-
rating activities remain largely unchanged in these companies and only administrative functions are centralized.
for the delivery hero group, there are risks not only from external development but also from internal proces-
ses. weakened consumer spending from private households could negatively impact group revenue. however, 
in view of the modestly positive forecasts for the global economy in 2017, the management assesses the dan-
ger of a downturn in consumer spending as low.
in summary, the delivery hero group exhibits an elevated risk which is normal for start-ups. the break-even at 
group level has not been reached. as a result, the group is dependent on external financing. even though the-
re has been strong revenue growth, there is still considerable growth potential. the management thus assumes 
that until the break-even is reached, it will be possible to access external financing. 
03 opportunity report
the opportunity report deals with the business opportunities which can result for the delivery hero group 
during the course of the year following the reporting date.
the opportunities in the following report are shown in the order of their impact on the group.
in the gastronomy sector, alongside take-away the home delivery market is regarded as the trend with 
above-average growth rates. this relates not only to developed markets such as germany, but also to emer-
ging countries in latin america, asia-pacific and the near east. on the basis of the rigorous alignment of the 
business model to customer requirements within a growth market, the delivery hero group continues to enjoy 
the upside of increasing revenue levels. with targeted marketing campaigns, sponsoring and discounts, the 
companies want to further increase awareness levels on a global basis. these marketing activities combined 
with the best buying experience target the acquisition of new customers and achieving loyalty to delivery hero 
with existing customers.
in the industry, the trailblazing trend relates to the delivery of high quality and fresh meals, especially in the 
developed markets. the investment in foodora last year resulted not only in the acquisition of expertise, but 
also in obtaining a global brand in this area. the management is convinced that attractive growth rates can be 
achieved in this area, also on a long-term basis and is thus pushing its activities in this future-oriented market.
the acquisition of the foodpanda group in december 2016 will make a major contribution to revenue across 
the delivery hero group, especially in the geographical markets in europe, asia and mena. with the new com-
panies, the presence of delivery hero in eastern europe has been expanded. the acquisition has also extended 
the geographical footprint of the group in the developing markets of asia. in mena too a positive trend is an-
ticipated, especially as a result of acquiring the market leader in egypt, otlob, which is the brand under which 
foodpanda operates there.

additional synergies can be realized on the basis of the joint use of the online platform by many companies of 
the delivery hero group. an order platform is to be developed and maintained successively on a centralized 
basis, and then filled with local content by the individual companies. by sharing expenses from development 
and maintenance of the platform across the participating individual companies of the delivery hero group, 
expenditure at the country companies is reduced, resulting in a considerable competitive edge against market 
participants without a similar platform system.
synergies can also be obtained from the joint use of marketing measures and the global exchange of ideas, as 
long as no impediments result from cultural differences in individual regions.
delivery hero can also leverage potential from internal exchange between the group among the country com-
panies. on the basis of this exchange of ideas, delivery hero can identify global trends in the sector early and 
react quickly. the acquisitions in recent years not only extend the opportunities for exchange within the group, 
but also generate new impulses for innovations and new products.
further optimization of liquidity and cash flows of the parties involved in the order process on the basis of 
integrating digital payment systems offer considerable additional strategic potential. on the other hand, this 
currently is also mitigated by considerable administrative work and regulatory requirements.
the delivery hero group is also reacting to increasing use of mobile devices. intensive further development on 
the delivery hero apps is being undertaken for various mobile operating systems. the group is noting a stea-
dily increasing number of orders from mobile devices.
the target group of delivery hero is young and has a strong affinity to the internet. it often uses social 
networks to exchange information. increasingly, delivery hero is integrating such social networks. in some 
countries, in the order process a login is possible via social networks favored by the target group, with the aim 
of simplifying the order process. at the same time, this further increases awareness for delivery hero.
in summary, the delivery hero group can participate in global trends, such as increased networking, the use 
of apps on smart phones and a change in eating habits. on the basis of professional structures in it and back 
office, growth of global business activities is supported in a targeted fashion.

01 risk management
the delivery hero group considers itself exposed to default risks, liquidity risks and market risks, especially in-
terest rate and foreign exchange risks, through the use of financial instruments. delivery hero actively monitors 
these risks and manages them using an effective risk management system. the risk management function is 
exercised in the governance, risk & compliance (grc) department.
02 liquidity risk
owing to its strong external growth, the delivery hero group has to rely on external financing to ensure suffi-
cient liquidity, as was the case in the previous year. a lack of external financing could threaten the group’s abi-
lity to continue as a going concern. through proper budget planning, the delivery hero group’s liquidity ma-
nagement ensures that sufficient funds are available. furthermore, a constantly secured and adequate amount 
of cash and cash equivalents ensures that operations can be financed. unused credit lines are also available.

the delivery hero group generates a significant portion of its revenue in foreign currencies through its inter-
national subsidiaries. as in the previous year, the delivery hero group generally tries to generate income and 
incur expenses in the same functional currency in order to reduce foreign exchange risk. the following table 
shows the effects on the group result that would result if the presented foreign currencies had appreciated or 
depreciated by 10% as of the reporting date.

a uruguayan subsidiary of the dh group has liabilities in usd, resulting in a foreign exchange rate risk between 
the uyu and usd, which would affect the net income (loss) for the period.
in addition, the delivery hero group considers itself exposed to foreign exchange risk through its investment in 
international subsidiaries when translating net assets.
some of the loans drawn by the group have floating interest rates on the basis of reference interest rates. 
changes in market interest rates may increase the interest payable in the future, which would negatively affect 
the company’s earnings situation. a 1% higher (lower) market interest rate in the reporting year would have 
led to an effect on profit or loss of keur 808 (keur 0). for the forecast period, the company assesses the risk 
of interest rate increases as low. however, interest rate increases are anticipated in the medium term. in the 
context of its risk management, the dh group is observing market trends. if necessary, it will limit this interest 
change risk with relevant derivative finance instruments. in the 2016 and 2015 reporting years, no agreements 
on such finance instruments were concluded.
the credit and default risk covers the risk that business partners, chiefly restaurants, do not meet their contrac-
tual obligations and that this can result in a loss for the delivery hero group. such risks mainly involve current 
trade receivables. the delivery hero group does not regard itself as being exposed to a major default risk from 
any single individual customer. the concentration of the creditworthiness risk is limited due to the broad and 
heterogeneous customer base. the delivery hero group monitors the default risk and manages it actively by 
making any necessary credit checks and by optimizing the payment process. the default risk is further reduced 
by an effective dunning system. the maximum default risk corresponds to the carrying amount of the financial 
assets.

the business development of delivery hero gmbh is subject to the same opportunities and risks as the delivery 
hero group. the expectations relating to the development of delivery hero gmbh are largely in line with the

choose from a wide range of delivery services in their region and can look at their menus. the order can be 
made by app or via the website and subsequently paid either in cash or on non-cash basis. delivery hero gene-
rates a large portion of its revenue on the basis of orders made. as an option, delivery hero offers the catering 
businesses a delivery and point of sale system in order to immediately view and accept orders made on the 
platform. in addition, delivery hero offers products and services for catering businesses, such as food packa-
ging as well as advertising and printing services. in addition to the online food ordering sector, with some of 
its platforms such as foodora or foodpanda, the group also offers food delivery to the customer. the drivers

e. supplementary business situation reporting on the single-entity 
financial statements of delivery hero gmbh | 02 business situation
in the financial year, delivery hero revenue declined slightly, by keur 829. this marginal decline is due pri-
marily to lower levels of oncharging and group allocations to the subsidiaries. as a result of oncharging and 
group allocations to the subsidiaries, revenue is the most important financial indicator for managing delivery 
hero gmbh.
in comparison to the previous year, staff costs declined by keur 12,614, driven largely by considerably lower al-
locations to provisions in connection with share-based incentive programs of keur 6,103 (previous year: keur 
21,430). these incentive programs have the aim of staff participation in the development of the company. this 
effect from the allocations to provisions for share-based payments is offset by a slight increase in the number of 
employees and the resulting higher staff costs (keur 6,511).
key items in other operating costs are expenses for currency translation and for consultancy services as a result 
of the increasing complexity and the concomitant requirement for expertise from external consultants and for 
optimizing the group structure, as well as integrating the acquired companies. the key element in other ope-
rating income is the realization of hidden reserves to a group company amounting to keur 106,583 from the 
non-cash contribution of the investment in online pizza norden ab.
higher depreciation and amortization in 2016 is due primarily to write-downs of financial assets amounting to 
keur 79,665, relating primarily to the impairment taken on the investment in delivery hero germany gmbh, 
in rgp local commons i gmbh & co kg, in rgp local holding i gmbh, in ceraon b.v., 9cookies gmbh and in 
takeeateasy.be sa.
in the reporting period, the negative result for the year improved by 80% to keur 16,998, due primarily to 
higher other operating income, and personnel expenses being down by 32%.

b) financial position
the financial position of the company is shown on the basis of the following condensed statement of cash 
flows (indirect method):
keur dec. 31, 2016 dec. 31, 2015
cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the financial year 70,355 3,912
cash flow from operating activities -32,974 -54,679
cash flow from investing activities -101,433 -416,643
cash flow from financing activities 64,826 537,764
net change in cash and cash equivalents -69,581 66,442
cash and cash equivalents at the end of the financial year 774 70,355
the negative cash flow from operating activities results primarily from the negative result of the year and hig-
her current assets, which cannot be allocated to financing or investing activities.
cash flow from investing activities consists primarily of acquisitions of shareholdings and loans to companies in 
the delivery hero group. due to the business model, the investment activity of the company in property, plant 
and equipment is relatively low.
cash flow from financing activities reflects increased borrowing impacting cash, in particular as a result of 
taking up a loan from an affiliated company. this contributed to securing operating activities at delivery hero 
gmbh. for further information on the financing measures, please refer to section 2. business performance.
in 2016, the solvency of the parent company and the subsidiary was secured at all times, particularly as a result 
of payments by the partners in the context of loans extended and by taking up a bank loan.
in 2018, loan liabilities to various lenders totaling keur 272,975 are due for payment.
part of the loan repayment is to come from the purchase price payment for the planned disposal of the invest-
ment in the hungryhouse group. this sale is conditional on the approval of the united kingdom’s competition 
and markets authority (cma).
if the anti-trust authorities do not grant their approval, the management is of the opinion that the partners or 
further potential investors or other providers of capital will provide the liquid assets required for continuing 
the parent company, the subsidiaries and thus the group, especially for the repayment of loans and thus is 
accounting on a going concern basis.
the continuation of the operating activities of the group and the parent company and subsidiaries on a going 
concern basis thus depends on implementing further measures to secure capital and equity by the partners, po-
tential investors or other providers of capital. furthermore, the recoverability of the reported goodwill depends 
on the occurrence of the underlying assumptions made in respect to revenue and ebitda growth.

as of the reporting date, the cash and cash equivalents reported are not subject to any material restrictions on 
disposal. due to local currency controls in argentina, transferring capital to other countries may be restricted.
as of december 31, 2016, there are unutilized credit facilities provided by third parties of keur 25,000 (previous 
year: keur 0).

total liabilities and equity 1,919,724 –  1,437,102  – 34 %
the assets of delivery hero gmbh increased by a significant 34%, largely due to acquisitions. financing for the 
additional assets was provided largely by partner allocations and to a lesser extent from loans extended on a 
long-term basis.
as in the previous year, assets are largely non-current assets, which in turn are predominantly interests in affili-
ated companies.

management report financial statements financial statements
e. supplementary business situation reporting on the single-entity 
financial statements of delivery hero gmbh | 02 business situation
the change of current assets in 2016 was the result chiefly of negative cash flow and the resulting decline in 
cash and cash equivalents.
the equity and liabilities side is made up of equity and special accounts as well as a considerably lower share of 
liabilities. equity as of december 31, 2016 increased year on year as a result of equity contributions from part-
ners totaling keur 19,270. this increase is offset by the net loss of the current year of keur -16,998. in addition, 
a partner made a non-cash contribution of keur 364,289. this was reported in 2016 for entry into the commer-
cial register. however, the entry took place only in january 2017. for this reason, the amount was deducted 
from equity as a special account. there are liabilities which are due in a period between one and five years of 
keur 334,088 (previous year: keur 319,606).
the 46% year-on-year increase in provisions resulted primarily from long-term staff incentive programs. it was 
especially the expansion of the staff programs in the wake of the acquisitions of delivery hero gmbh which 
resulted in a considerable rise of provisions for employee claims from these programs.
liabilities were 29% up in comparison to the previous year, due large to new loans being taken up.
d) overall assessment
in summary, the management assesses the financial position, financial performance and cash flows as positive 
and in view of the considerable expansion in the reporting year in line with expectations. even though the 
company is still generating significant losses, these are in line with what had been envisaged, in view of the 
corporate acquisitions and the resulting, partly far-reaching, expansion of business. as of the reporting date, a 
considerable level of equity capital was available.
the revenue upturn forecast in the previous year was not achieved in the financial year. for 2016, negative 
ebitda was expected, but one that was better than 2015 (previous year: keur -50,652). in 2016, this forecast 
was exceeded considerably, with a figure of keur 77,150. furthermore, no material earnings contributions to 
the investment on result were expected. this forecast was confirmed in 2016.

     financial statements in accordance with ifrs
the consolidated financial statements of the dh group have been prepared in accordance with the internatio-
nal financial reporting standards (ifrs) adopted and issued by the international accounting standards board 
(iasb), as adopted by the european union. preparation of the consolidated financial statements occurred under 
application of the provisions of regulation (ec) no 1606/2002 of the european parliament and of the council of 
july 19, 2002, on the application of international accounting standards in conjunction with section 315a (3) of 
the german commercial code [hgb] taking into consideration the supplementary provisions of german 
commercial law.
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income has been prepared in accordance with the cost-of-sales 
method. there is a distinction between current and non-current assets and liabilities in the presentation of the 
consolidated statement of financial positions. assets or liabilities falling due within one year are classified as 
current. individual items in the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of financial position are 
summarized to improve the clarity of the presentation. these items are explained in the notes to the consolida-
ted financial statements. 
the structure of the statement of comprehensive income was adjusted in this financial year, ensuring an 
improved presentation of the actual financial position, profit situation and financial performance and align-
ment with common practice. the following significant changes in recognition were made:
+ the items “finance income” and “finance costs” were eliminated.  
“net interest income” is recognized as a new item.
+ gains and losses from the effect of movements in exchange rates were reclassified from  
“other operating income” and “other operating expenses” to “other finance income/costs.”
+ expenses from trade receivables and impairment losses on uncollectible receivables are now recognized 
under “other operating expenses.” they were previously shown under “cost of sales.”
+ delivery costs were reclassified from “marketing expenses” to “cost of sales.”
+ impairment on other receivables from third parties and goodwill impairment were both reclassified from 
“general administrative expenses” to “other operating expenses.”
+ loss from impairment on brands and impairment on other intangible assets are recognized under  
“general administrative expenses.” they were previously shown under “marketing expenses.”

02 basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with ifrs
the consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. unless otherwise stated, all figures have been 
rounded to the nearest eur thousand (keur). for computational reasons, there may be rounding differences to 
the exact mathematical values in tables and references. 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of the going concern principle, which assumes 
that the group is able to meet the obligatory terms of redemption of loan liabilities, as specified in notes e.14 
and e.11 (refer also to section i.02.d)). the dh group generated a consolidated loss from continuing and 
discontinued operations of keur -194.932 in the 2016 financial year (2015: keur -252.944). due to increasing 
debt and equity, the previous loss before interest and taxes is offset again in the 2016 financial year. as of the 
reporting date, capital resources were raised to a considerable extent from third parties (refer also to section h). 
as a consequence, management realistically expects that the group will have adequate resources to continue 
business activities for the foreseeable period. assets and liabilities are therefore principally measured at 
amortized cost. exceptions are financial assets and liabilities that are carried at the fair value applicable on the 
reporting date. these are listed in sections b.09.a) and b.09.b).
in 2018, loan commitments against various lenders amounting to keur 272,975 are due for repayment. the 
repayment of the loans is to be made, inter alia, from the purchase price payment for the planned sale of the 
hungryhouse group. this sale is subject to the suspensive approval of the united kingdom‘s competition and 
markets authority (“cma”).
in the event that the cma does not approve, the management assumes that the shareholders or other 
potential investors or other capital providers are providing the funds necessary for going concern of the parent 
company, subsidiaries and thus of the group, in particular for the repayment of the loans, and is therefore 
recognized on a going-concern basis.
the continuation of dh group business activities, as well as the continued existence of the parent company and 
the subsidiary companies, therefore depends on the implementation of further capital and liquidity measures 
by the shareholders or by other potential investors or other capital providers.
the consolidated financial statements and group management report are published in the german federal 
gazette [bundesanzeiger].
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with ifrss requires management estimates 
and measurements. areas involving a higher degree of judgment or areas where assumptions and estimates 
are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note b.15.

b. accounting policies | 01 methods of consolidation
b. accounting policies
the dh financial statements and those of subsidiaries in and outside of germany are prepared according to 
uniform accounting policies. in the process, the principles are consistently applied for all presented periods and 
reporting dates in the consolidated financial statements.
01 methods of consolidation
a) subsidiaries
dh and all subsidiaries over which dh has the possibility of direct or indirect control are fully consolidated in 
the consolidated financial statements of the dh group. first-time consolidation occurs at the date of obtaining 
of control. dh controls an investee when it is exposed to variable returns from its involvement and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power of control. if dh loses control, the relevant participating 
undertaking is deconsolidated.
acquirees are recognized by applying the acquisition method. in applying the acquisition method, the cost of 
the acquired shares is allocated pro-rata on fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of the subsidiary at the acquisition date. a positive difference arising from allocation is capitalized as derived 
goodwill. negative differences that result from capital consolidation at the date of acquisition are immediately 
recognized in profit or loss.
non-controlling interests constitute the share of profit or loss and net assets that is not attributed to the 
parent’s shareholders and are recognized separately. they are measured at the acquisition date using the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets. changes in the group’s interest in a subsidiary that 
do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. 
concerning written put options agreed in the course of acquisitions regarding remaining non-controlling 
interests, the company makes uses of the following option: written put options are recognized according to 
the anticipated acquisition method. thus, non-controlling interests are no longer recognized for these.
when the group loses control of a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary and all 
related non-controlling interests and other equity components. any gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. 
any retained interest in the former subsidiary is recognized at fair value on the date when control was lost.

expenses and income, as well as receivables and payables between consolidated entities, are eliminated along 
with intragroup profits/losses arising from intragroup transactions.
in the case of four (previous year: 0) subsidiaries, inclusion in the consolidated financial statements is waived 
due to the subordinate importance and materiality as well as the negative cost-benefit ratio.
b) associates and joint arrangements
associates are companies over which dh has a significant influence; this usually assumes a holding of between 
20% and 50% of voting rights. joint ventures are joint arrangements for which dh jointly shares rights to the 
net assets of the arrangement with other companies. as of the reporting date, two associates were included in 
the consolidated financial statements (december 31, 2015: two). as in the prior years, in dh’s view there were 
no joint arrangements.
the list of shareholdings in section i.09 contains a detailed overview of all dh subsidiaries and associates.

02 currency translation
currencies are translated in accordance with the concept of the functional currency. the functional currency for 
all subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements of dh is the respective local currency. the 
consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros (reporting currency).
transactions not conducted in the functional currency of a company included in the consolidation group 
(foreign currency transactions) are translated into the functional currency of the respective entity at the rate on 
the transaction date. exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
measurement of monetary assets and liabilities are recognized through profit or loss in the statement of 
comprehensive income at the closing rate in the financial statements.
for the purposes of inclusion in the consolidated financial statements of dh, subsidiaries that do not have the 
euro as functional currency translate their separate financial statements, prepared in local currency, into the 
euro reporting currency as follows:
+ assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate, income and expenses are translated at the average 
rate.
+ equity subject to obligatory first-time consolidation in the course of acquiring international subsidiaries is 
translated at the respective reporting date with the historical rate at the date of acquisition. differences 
arising from currency translation are shown separately in equity.
+ as long as the subsidiary is included in the group of consolidated entities, translation differences are 
recognised in group equity. if subsidiaries leave the group of consolidated entities, the corresponding 
translation differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss.
+ goodwill and restatements of the fair value of assets and liabilities due to acquisitions of international 
subsidiaries are treated as assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries and translated with the rate as 
of the reporting date. 
+ there are no subsidiaries registered in hyperinflation countries pursuant to ias 29. 
+ currency translation differences arising from the translation of shares in one international subsidiary as well 
as from loans, which are a part of the net investment in this international subsidiary, are recognized in 
equity. if an international subsidiary leaves the group of consolidated entities, the currency translation 
differences are derecognized through profit or loss.

03 recognition of income and expenses
expenses and income are not offset unless ifrs accounting requirements permit this or require offsetting.
a) revenue
the dh group generates revenue from commission and fees for linking to the delivery hero online platform, 
for the provision of order confirmation terminals at contractual partners, for eye-catching presentation on the 
dh order platform (premium placement) and for the use of credit cards.
commission is collected from restaurants for order forwarding via the delivery hero online platform. in genera-
ting commission income, the dh group acts as an agent as the dh group is solely an intermediary between the 
main supplier and the end customer. the corresponding revenue is recognized as soon as the customer’s online 
order is completed. commissions are recognized at fair value less discounts, value added tax and other price 
discounts.
furthermore, dh provides contractual partners with order confirmation terminals to confirm order acceptance 
directly to the customer via the delivery hero online platform. the dh group provides terminals on a leasing 
or purchase basis. if a terminal is sold, revenue is recognized as soon as the risks and rewards arising from 
the goods are transferred to customers, namely upon delivery. leases of terminals to contractual partners are 
classified as operating leases. associated incoming payments are recognized on a straight-line basis according 
to the lease term.
connection fees are realized directly after contact to the delivery hero online platform. fees are payable in all 
cases.
fees for the use of credit cards are realized as soon as the customer order is fully processed and no further 
performance obligations are to be fulfilled on the part of the dh group.
revenue from premium placement is recognized over the period in which this service is rendered by the dh 
group.
service fees are collected from restaurants for the distribution of orders. in generating delivery income, the 
dh group acts as an agent as the dh group solely assumes delivery to the end customer. the corresponding 
revenue is recognized as soon as delivery is made to the customer. delivery fees are recognized at fair value 
less discounts, value added tax and other price discounts.
in the case of the foodora group, orders are delivered for restaurants without their own delivery service. the 
dh group carries out the delivery with its own personnel, for which it collects a delivery fee on top of the com-
mission. the dh group acts as principal here. the delivery fees are recognized at fair value less discounts, value 
added tax and other price discounts.

b. accounting policies | 03 recognition of income and expenses
b) customer loyalty program
some dh group companies have set up customer loyalty programs; customers can use these to collect points 
(award credits) through placing orders, entitling them to discounted ordering in future.
award credits are recognized as separately identifiable components of sales transactions. the fair value of the 
consideration received in the course of the original sale is allocated to award credits and other components of 
the transaction. the relative fair value method is used to determine values.
the award-credit portion of the consideration is recognized as revenue when the credit is redeemed and the 
group company has fulfilled its obligation to surrender the credit (refer also to section f.15). the amount of 
revenue is determined by the number of surrendered award credits in relation to the total number of expected 
credits to be redeemed. award credits expire 12 months after the day of the original transaction.
c) interest and similar income
interest income is recognized as income when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the company 
and the extent of the income can be reliably determined.
d) expenses
expenses are presented in the statement of comprehensive income as soon as the underlying service has been 
rendered.

b. accounting policies | 04 property, plant and equipment
04 property, plant and equipment
items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses. cost comprises incidental purchase costs less price reductions. 
depreciation occurs on a straight-line basis over the time period of the expected useful life of the asset.
in the reporting year, depreciation was based on the following useful lives:
useful life in years 2016 2015
operating and office equipment 2 - 25 2 - 25
leasehold improvements 8 - 20 8 - 20
in addition, processes were introduced that take account of the requirements of ias 36 in respect of impair-
ment of assets. if there is an objective indication that non-current assets carried at amortized cost are impaired, 
the recoverable amount is determined. if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount for the 
individual asset value, additional impairment losses are recognized directly in the statement of comprehensive 
income. if the requirements for impairment in following years are no longer in place, prior corrections are 
reversed.
repair and maintenance expenses are expensed at the time of their occurrence. material innovations and 
improvements are capitalized.rt.

05 intangible assets and goodwill
intangible assets acquired for consideration are carried at amortized cost. they are amortized on a straight-line 
basis over their individual useful lives. internally generated intangible assets are measured at cost and 
amortized over their estimated useful lives. development expenditure is capitalized if development costs can 
be reliably measured, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future benefit is probable 
and the group intends and has sufficient resources to be able to complete development and use or sell the 
asset. the capitalization of development expenditure also requires the clear separability of research and 
development costs. it is capitalized if the requirements for the clear separability of research and development 
costs are met. other development expenditure is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income as soon as it is incurred. capitalized development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and amortization and accumulated impairment losses. research costs are recognized in profit or 
loss in the period in which they are incurred.
the expected useful life of the brand is forecast in accordance with verifiable history and observable user 
behavior. the underlying useful life of customer and supplier relationships is determined individually corres-
ponding to historical migration rates of restaurants within a year. 
a review of intangible assets pursuant to ias 36 is made to check for necessary impairment losses in the dh 
group when indications for trigger events are present. 
in this case, the recoverable amount is determined for the asset concerned and cash generating unit (cgu - for 
definition see below), respectively. the recoverable amount is the larger amount of the fair value less costs of 
disposal and value in use. 
in the reporting year, depreciation was based on the following useful lives:
useful life in years 2016 2015
software 2 - 3 2 - 3
trademarks 5 - 25 5 - 25
customer and supplier relationships 3 - 10 3 - 10
goodwill principally results from the acquisition of subsidiaries and corresponds to the sum of the transferred 
consideration, the amount of all non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the previously 
held equity interests in the acquiree less the fair value of acquired net assets. if the fair value of the acquired 
net assets exceeds the sum of the transferred consideration, the amount of all non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree and the fair value of the previously held equity interests, the difference is directly recognized in the 
consolidated statement of financial position.
the goodwill is subjected to an annually impairment test in accordance with ias 36 as well as in the case of 
indications of impairment. for the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a cash-generating 
unit (cgu).

b. accounting policies | 05 intangible assets and goodwill / 06 leases
an asset’s cash-generating unit is the smallest group of assets that includes the asset and generates cash 
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. if the recoverab-
le amount cannot be determined for an individual asset, the lowest aggregation of assets that generates 
largely independent cash inflows is identified.
impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of the individual cgu allocated to the goodwill exceeds the 
recoverable amount. this recoverable amount corresponds to the larger amount of fair value less costs of 
disposal and value in use.
fair value is the amount that independent market participant would pay under usual market conditions at the 
valuation date for the sale of the asset or cgu.
the fair value less costs of disposal of the cgu was calculated by applying the discounted cash flow method, as 
follows. basis for determining the expected future cash flow is a detailed planning period of three years for the 
cgus. owing to the character of the cgus it is expected that subsequently to the detailed planning period the 
condition of the business not yet being in steady state. therefore, for the valuation model subsequently, a 
modeling of the expected future cash flows (before interest and taxes) of the cgu in the steady state is made 
under consideration of cgu-specific revenue and result growth and a perpetuity was calculated on this basis. 
if an impairment requirement is determined, the goodwill is impaired. an impairment loss is then distributed 
on a pro rata basis to the remaining non-current assets. if a higher recoverable amount of the asset or the cgu 
is generated at a later date in accordance with the impairment loss in previous years, the impairment loss is 
reversed up to a maximum of the amortized cost. reversals of impairments on goodwill are not taken as they 
are not permitted under ias 36.
06 leases
a) accounting as lessee
the dh group has entered into lease arrangements that do not meet the criteria for finance leases and are 
consequently classified as operating leases. lease payments are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.

01. combined 02. consolidated 03. notes to the consolidated

b. accounting policies | 06 leases / 07 inventories / 08 income taxes
b) accounting as lessor
some companies in the dh group act as lessors of order confirmation terminals, which restaurants put into 
place to directly confirm order acceptance to the customer via the delivery hero online platform. as signifi-
cant risks and rewards of ownership are retained by dh, these agreements are classified as operating leases 
pursuant to ias 17.
accordingly, dh depreciates terminals on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life and recognizes lease 
payments in a similar way over the term of the lease agreement.
07 inventories
inventories are carried at cost, which is determined on the basis of direct production costs and production-rela-
ted overheads. inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value as of each reporting date. 
cost includes all costs of purchase, production and other costs that are incurred in bringing the inventories to 
their present location and condition. the first-in, first-out method (fifo) is used to measure cost. net realizable 
value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make 
the sale.
08 income taxes
taxes on income for the period are the sum of current and deferred income taxes. these are recognized in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income unless they relate to items recognized directly in equity or 
other comprehensive income. in this case, income tax is also recognized directly in equity or other comprehen-
sive income.
a) current income taxes
the current income tax expense is calculated by applying the tax regulations enacted on the reporting date in 
countries in which the dh group operates and taxable income is generated. in assessing income tax demands 
and liabilities, estimates must be partially made. a deviating tax assessment by the respective tax authorities 
cannot be excluded. the associated uncertainty is taken into account by only stating uncertain tax demands 
and liabilities if the probability of occurrence from the perspective of dh is greater than 50%. the expected tax 
payment is taken as a base as best estimate for the recognition of uncertain tax items.

b. accounting policies | 08 income taxes/ 09 financial instruments
b) deferred income taxes
deferred taxes are recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable 
income. furthermore, deferred tax assets are recognized for tax loss carryforwards.
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. 
deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards to the extent to which 
it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences and/or loss carryforwards can be utilized.
deferred taxes are measured in accordance with ias 12. they are measured at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled.
the change in deferred taxes is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income provided it 
relates to items in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income that were recognized in the statement 
of comprehensive income. if the items in the statement of financial position directly relate to equity or other 
comprehensive income, the corresponding deferred taxes are also recognized in these items. 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arising through temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, 
associates or joint arrangements are taken into account unless the date for reversal of temporary differences 
can be determined at group level and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if the group has a legally enforceable right to set off 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and concern the same taxable entity. in addition, deferred taxes are set 
off if the maturities of the statement of financial position items for which the deferred taxes were recognized 
match.
09 financial instruments
a) financial assets
in accordance with ias 39, financial assets are broken down into the following categories:
i   assets measured at fair value through profit or losse
ii  loans and receivables
iii  financial assets held for sale
 
classification is made at first-time recognition.

01. combined 02. consolidated 03. notes to the consolidated
management report financial statements financial statements
b. accounting policies | 09 financial instruments
i
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. this classification is 
made if the asset was acquired with the intention to sell in the short term. these assets are shown as current if 
their realization is expected within 12 months. all other assets are shown as non-current.
derivative financial instruments are measured upon initial recognition and subsequently at fair value. financial 
derivatives held for trading purposes are recognized as current assets.
 
ii
loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not 
traded in an active market. they are included in current assets as long as their maturities do not extend beyond 
twelve months after the reporting date. otherwise they are classified as non-current assets.
loans and receivables are stated at the date of first-time recognition at fair value plus transaction costs. they 
are subsequently measured at amortized cost and using the effective interest method.
using empirical values and individual risk assessments, possible default risks are recognized using appropriate 
impairment taking into consideration net cash flows. in doing so, a distinction is made between specific 
valuation allowances and general valuation allowances. objective indications of the materialization of an 
impairment loss could be the following: indications of financial difficulties at a customer or group of customers, 
default or delay in paying interest or principal, a heightened probability of insolvency or observable data that 
point to a quantifiable contraction in estimated future cash flows from a group of financial assets. in the case of 
general valuation allowances, the group uses historical information on the timing of payments and the extent 
of losses occurring, adjusted by the management board judging whether the current general business 
environment and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are probably higher or lower than the losses 
that would have been expected based on historical trends.
if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment falls and this fall results from circumstances occurring 
after the first-time recognition of the impairment, the reversal of the impairment loss is recognized through 
profit or loss.
impairment losses are indirectly recognized through an allowance account. in the event of there being no 
realistic prospect of the receivable being collected, the carrying amount of the receivable is derecognized from 
the allowance account.
cash and cash equivalents comprise all cash-related assets that have a remaining term of less than three 
months at the date of acquisition or investment. this includes mainly cash at banks and cash on hand. cash and 
cash equivalents are measured at nominal value.

financial assets held for sale are assets that are destined for sale but are not held for trading purposes. they 
are measured at fair value if this can be reliably determined. if this is not possible, these assets are measured at 
cost less impairment losses.
regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized at the price on the trade date.
b) financial liabilities
in accordance with ias 39, financial liabilities are broken down into the following categories:
i  at amortized cost
ii  measured at fair value through profit or loss.
 
 
 
i
financial liabilities are stated at fair value taking into account transaction costs as well as premiums and 
discounts at initial recognition. the fair value at the date of the financial liability being incurred corresponds to 
the present value of future payment obligations based on a market interest rate with a matching term and risk. 
subsequent measurement occurs at amortized cost using the effective interest method. the effective interest 
rate is determined at the date liabilities to banks are incurred. interest income and expenses are recognized in 
profit or loss according to the effective interest method.
amendments to the terms and conditions in respect of the amount and/or date of interest and principal 
payments result in remeasurement of the carrying amount of the liability in the amount of the present value 
and on the basis of the originally determined effective interest rate. differences to the carrying amount of the 
liability previously stated are recognized in profit or loss. if changes in terms and conditions lead to materially 
different contract terms pursuant to ias 39.ag 62, the original liability is treated in accordance with ias 39.40 as 
if it were fully paid off. recognition subsequently occurs as a new liability at fair value.
 
ii
financial liabilities, which are measured at fair value, relate mainly to written embedded derivatives, earn-outs 
and liabilities from put/call options.

b. accounting policies | 10 employee benefits
10 employee benefits
a) current employee benefits
current employee benefits are expensed in the period service is rendered. a liability is recognized for the 
amount expected to be paid if the dh group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount 
as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be reliably estimated.
b) pension obligations
pension obligations and similar obligations arise from the obligations of one dh group entity to its employees. 
the obligations of these defined benefit plans are measured using the projected unit credit method. under this 
method, expected future increases in salaries and pensions are taken into account in addition to the pensions 
and acquired pension entitlements known at the reporting date.
pension obligations are determined by independent actuaries. effects arising from the remeasurement of 
actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the impact of any asset ceiling 
(excluding interest) are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. the discount rate 
stated reflects the interest rate generated by senior fixed-interest bonds with matching maturities on the 
reporting date.
the fair value of any plan assets is deducted from the discounted pension obligation.
the interest rate effect included in pension expenses is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income under interest expenses. service cost is shown in individual functional 
areas in operating profit.
c) share-based payments
dh grants group management and selected senior management share-based payment in the form of virtual 
shares (options). these virtual options mature as soon as an ‘exit event’ occurs. the acquisition of more than 
75% of shares in dh by one or more investors, as well as the liquidation of the company, is defined as an exit 
event. 
in addition, since 2015 there have been further share-based payment programs at dh subsidiaries.
the components recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income beyond the exercise pe-
riod correspond to the fair value of options at the date of their being granted as the obligation by dh is made 
in cash and/or in cash equivalents. in this regard, the fair value is determined using recognized measurement 
models. the obligation and its increase or decrease over time are recognized as an expense under administrati-
ve expenses.

12 fair value of financial instruments
equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured in the dh group at the fair value on the grant 
date, the fair value being determined using approved measurement methods (black scholes formula). the fair 
value of the obligation is recognized over the vesting period in administrative expenses and offset with the 
capital reserve.
11 other provisions
other provisions are set up if a legal or constructive obligation to the dh group resulting from a past event 
exists, its fulfillment is probable and its amount can be reliably determined. recognition is made in the amount 
of the expected settlement amount. 
in view of estimation uncertainty in determining the amount, the actual outflow of resources may deviate from 
the original amounts recognized on the basis of estimates.
non-current provisions are recognized at the discounted settlement amount on the reporting date based on 
corresponding term and risk matching interest rates.
12 fair value of financial instruments
the fair value of financial instruments is determined on the basis of corresponding market values or valuation 
methods. the fair value of cash and cash equivalents and other current primary financial instruments corres-
ponds approximately to the carrying amounts recognized on the respective reporting dates.
the fair value of non-current receivables as well as other assets and liabilities is determined based on the 
expected cash flow using the reference interest rates valid at the reporting date. the fair value of derivatives is 
determined on the basis of option pricing models.
the fair value of financial instruments carried on the statement of financial position is principally determined 
using corresponding market or exchange prices. if no market or exchange prices are available, measurement is 
made using standard valuation methods taking account of instrument-specific market parameters. fair value is 
determined using the discounted cash flow method, whereby individual credit ratings and other market condi-
tions are taken into account in the form of standard credit and/or liquidity spreads in determining present value.

b. accounting policies | 13 determination of fair value / 14 government grants
13 determination of fair value
according to the provisions of ifrs 13, fair value is the price that would be generated by the sale of the asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in the primary market or, if this is not available, the most advantageous market. fair 
value is to be determined using measurement parameters that are as market-based as possible as the input 
factors. the measurement hierarchy (fair value hierarchy) attributes three stages in descending order for input 
factors used in the valuation technique, placing the highest priority on the most market-based inputs:
+ level 1: market prices (unadjusted) used in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity 
can access on the valuation date.
+ level 2: measurement parameters other than level 1 quoted prices that can be observed for assets or 
liabilities, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).
+ level 3: measurement parameters for assets and liabilities that are not based on observable market data.
where various input factors are relevant for measurement, the fair value is categorized at the same level of the 
fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
14 government grants
government grants are recognized if there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be received and the 
entity complies with the conditions attached to them. expense-related grants are recognized as income over the 
period required to offset them with the corresponding expenses that the grants are meant to compensate for.

b. accounting policies | 15 assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held

15 assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for  
    sale and discontinued operations
non-current assets and any corresponding liabilities held for sale and any directly attributable liabilities are 
recognized separately from other assets and liabilities in the balance sheet in the line items “assets included in 
a disposal group classified as held for sale” and “liabilities included in a disposal group classified as held for 
sale” if they can be disposed of in their current condition and if there is sufficient probability of their disposal 
actually taking place.
discontinued operations are components of an entity that are either held for sale or have already been sold 
and can be clearly distinguished from other corporate operations, both operationally and for financial repor-
ting purposes. additionally, the component classified as a discontinued operation must represent a major 
business line or a specific geographic business segment of the group. non-current assets that are held for sale 
either individually or collectively as part of a disposal group, or that belong to a discontinued operation, are no 
longer depreciated. they are instead accounted for at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less 
any remaining costs of disposal. if this value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. 
the income and losses resulting from the measurement of components held for sale as well as the gains and 
losses arising from the disposal of discontinued operations, are reported separately on the face of the consoli-
dated statement of comprehensive income under net profit or loss for the period from discontinued operations, 
net, as is the income from the ordinary operating activities of these divisions. the prior-year consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income is adjusted accordingly. the relevant assets and liabilities are reported in a 
separate line on the balance sheet. the cash flows of discontinued operations are reported separately in the 
cash flow statement, with prior-year figures adjusted accordingly.

b. accounting policies | 16 judgment and use of estimates
16 judgment and use of estimates
in the application of accounting policies and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, manage-
ment makes decisions based on judgment and estimates. this applies in particular to the following cases:
a) judgments
 
going concern assumption:
dh continues to be reliant on external financial resources. in 2016, considerable equity and debt was raised to 
secure future business activities. as a consequence, the going concern assumption is deemed to be satisfied. 
we refer to the explanations in section a.02.
 
revenue recognition of commission income:
dh classifies its intermediary activity as agent activity as dh does not act as the main supplier, is not exposed to 
storage risk, cannot influence the pricing of counterparties and receives commission as remuneration.
 
use of the anticipated acquisition method for acquisitions:
for put options written on remaining non-controlling interests in the course of acquisitions, the company 
makes use of its de facto option and recognizes the put options as if they had already been exercised in 
accordance with the anticipated acquisition method. as a consequence, put options are treated as contingent 
considerations. to that effect, no non-controlling interests are shown for these interests in group equity.

b. accounting policies | 16 judgment and use of estimates
b) assumptions and estimation uncertainty
 
recognition and measurement of other provisions
in respect of recognition and measurement, there are uncertainties in respect of future price increases as well 
as in respect of the extent, date and probability of utilization of the respective provision.
 
measurement of financial liabilities
in measuring financial liabilities, estimates of future cash flows and any changes in terms and conditions are of 
particular significance. furthermore, estimates are made for entity-specific risk premiums derived from the 
respective financing.
 
scope for recognizing deferred tax assets
an excess of deferred tax assets is only recognized if it is probable that future tax benefits can be realized based 
on tax budgets. the current taxable profit situation in future reporting years and thus the actual usability of 
deferred tax assets can vary from the estimate made at the date of recognizing deferred taxation. deferred tax 
assets on tax loss carryforwards or temporary differences are recognized based on future taxable income.
 
share-based payment (ifrs 2)
in respect of the accounting of virtual shares, assumptions and estimates are made for the development of 
performance indicators and fluctuation as well as the determination of entity value. these are determined 
using option pricing models.
 
goodwill impairment testing
determination of the recoverable amount requires assumptions and estimates, in particular on the future 
development of ebit and sustainable growth rates.
additional comments on the assumptions and estimates made are listed in the individual financial statement 
items in the disclosures. all assumptions and estimates are based on the conditions prevailing and assessments 
at the reporting date.
in assessing the future business development, the business environment, assumed as realistic at this point, was 
also taken into account for the sectors and regions in which the dh group operates. while management 
assumes that the assumptions and estimates used are appropriate, any unforeseeable changes to these 
assumptions could affect the group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows.

c. new standards and interpretations that have not yet been applied
the following standards are mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after january 1, 2016 and did not 
have significant effects on dh:
+ amendments to ias 27: equity method in separate financial statements. 
+ amendments to ias 1: disclosure initiative 
+ annual improvements to the ifrs cycle 2012-2014: amendments to ifrs 5, ifrs 7, ias 19, ias 34. 
+ amendments to ias 16 und ias 38: clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation
+ amendments to ias 16 und ias 41: agriculture: bearer plants.
+ amendments to ias 27: equity method in separate financial statements.
+ amendments to ifrs 11: accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations.
+ amendments to ifrs 10, ifrs 12 und ias 28: investment entities: applying the consolidation exception
 
the following new standards are currently being examined by dh for their effect on information to be presen-
ted in the consolidated financial statements. at the time of preparing the consolidated financial statements for 
the 2016 reporting period, dh cannot yet completely assess the effects of the new provisions. dh will perform 
a more precise assessment of the impacts in the near future.
+ ifrs 9: this standard serves recognition, measurement and derecognition of financial instruments and 
introduces new provisions on hedge accounting. in july 2014, the iasb published further changes to the 
provisions on recognition and measurement and a new model for recording impairments. the new standard 
for financial instruments is now fully completed following publication of the most recent amendments. 
+ ifrs 15: this standard replaces ias 18 for income from the sale of goods and income from service transac-
tions, ias 11 for construction contracts and ifric 13 customer loyalty programs. the aim of the new 
standards is for income to be first recognized upon completion of the supply of the goods or rendering of 
services. the concept of recognizing income upon completion of the performance obligation by the 
company replaces the existing concept of risks and consideration. the standard allows for modified 
retrospective adoption. this means that during the transition period companies can recognize the adjust-
ments as retained earnings until the date of first adoption without an entry in the comparative period. 
these new provisions are only used for agreements not yet fulfilled at the time of first time adoption.
+ ifrs 16: this standard replaces the currently applicable standards for lease accounting (ias 17, sic-27 and 
ifric 4) and governs the recognition, measurement, disclosure and the tax liabilities in relation to the leases 
of both contracting parties, i.e. the lessee and lessor. the most significant amendment that the new 
standard introduces is the recognition by the lessee of all assets from lease agreements. there are excep-
tions for certain current and low-value assets.

on account of the complexity of acquisitions, the company retains the option of making a retroactive adjust-
ment. key, open issues include reviewing how the brands and customer relationships, the fair value of conside-
ration, non-controlling interests and resulting deferred taxes are measured. therefore, the disclosures are 
provisional in terms of ifrs 3.45.
goodwill, which represents mainly non-separately identifiable assets such as the positive business outlook and 
employee expertise, is not tax-deductible. acquired intangible assets are not subject to an indefinite useful life. 
trade receivables from third parties with a gross value of keur 6.408 were acquired, of which keur 1.607 is 
probably uncollectible. the fair value of the trade receivables from third parties amounts to keur 4.801.
as the foodpanda group was first included as of december 31, 2016, the foodpanda group made no contributi-
on to the group revenue and the loss of the financial year. if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of 
the year, the foodpanda group would have contributed keur 50,572 to revenue and keur 9,281 to the 
consolidated loss.

d) discontinued operations
 
sale of the hungryhouse group
due to changes in strategic direction, the company announced on december 15, 2016, that it intended to sell 
its shares in the hungryhouse group. the hungryhouse group operates an online food ordering portal on the 
british market and is allocated to the europe segment. the buyer for the shares is just eat plc (“just eat”). the 
transaction is conditional on the approval of the united kingdom’s competition and markets authority (cma). 
approval is expected during the 2017 financial year. until this point, hungryhouse group will continue to be 
operated independently by delivery hero. as a result, the assets of the hungryhouse group were recognized as 
non-current assets held for sale as of december 31, 2016.
the sale price comprises a fixed purchase price component of gbp 200 million payable in cash and a contingent 
purchase price component of gpb -30 million up to gbp +40 million payable in cash. the payment of the 
contingent purchase price component depends on the financial performance of the hungryhouse group in the 
period between the conclusion of the purchase agreement and the closing of the transaction.
the hungryhouse group represents a material geographical operation within the group. the subsidiary was not 
acquired with a view to resale. the intended sale therefore falls under the definition of a discontinued 
operation according to ifrs 5.32. in accordance with ifrs 5.15, the discontinued operation was measured at 
carrying amount as this is lower than the fair value less costs of disposal.
the profit or loss from the hungryhouse group as of december 31, 2016, was as follows:
profit or loss from the discontinued operation in keur 2016 2015
revenue 43,941 41,734

e. operating segments
01 segmentation principles
the managing director of the company is the group’s chief operating decision maker. in line with the manage-
ment approach, the operating segments were identified on the basis of internal reporting. internal reporting is 
the basis for the allocation of resources and the evaluation of the performance of the operating segments by 
the managing director.
the group’s business activity is segmented according to geographical attributes. there is separate internal 
reporting to the managing director for the europe, mena, asia and americas regions. turkey is assigned to the 
mena segment, australia to the asia segment and canada to the americas segment. the group offers food 
ordering and delivery services with a different configuration of platform-based marketplace offers and delivery 
services depending on the segment. the regional range of services is determined partly by demand, infrastruc-
ture, demographic circumstances and the competitive situation. 
the profitability of the operating segments is measured on the basis of adjusted ebitda. adjusted ebitda is the 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, financial result, depreciation and amortization and 
non-operating earnings effects. non-operating earnings effects comprise, in particular (i) expenses for 
share-based payment, (ii) expenses for services in connection with corporate transactions and financing rounds, 
reorganization measures, the implementation of information technology and the achievement of capital 
market capability and (iii) other non-operating expenses and income, especially the result from disposal of 
tangible and intangible assets, the result from income and expenses from sale and abandonment of subsidiari-
es, allowances for other receivables and non-income taxes.

a) revenue
sales between segments are conducted at market prices. the revenue with external customers reported to the 
managing director generally equals the measurement of the revenue recognized in the statement of compre-
hensive income. if delivery hero is considered obliged to perform services (principal) on the basis of regional 
contractual arrangements, the reporting to the managing director may provide for presentation as a agency 
service (as with the usual services in the group as an agent) for comparability purposes.

a) reconciliation of carrying amount
intangible assets mainly increased in the reporting period due to the acquisition of the foodpanda group. 
owing to this, goodwill rose by keur 215.868, trademarks by keur 10.749 and customer and supplier relations-
hips by keur 3.768 in 2016 (for details of company acquisitions, please see section b.02). the useful life of the 
brands identified as part of the acquisition is five years and that of the customer and supplier relationships is 
between three and eight years. the remaining useful life of the other brands is three to 23 years; that of the 
other customer and supplier relationships is one to 23 years.
internally generated intangible assets were also acquired in the course of company acquisitions in 2016. they 
mainly relate to costs of the development of websites. the reclassifications made relate mainly to non-current 
assets of discontinued operations.
in the current financial year, the carrying amount of the delivery hero germany gmbh cgu was reduced to the 
recoverable amount. the resulting impairment of keur -9.633 on the goodwill of the cgu, which is allocated to 
the europe segment, was recognized in other operating expenses. the goodwill impairment of keur -2.089 
recognized in other operating expenses in 2015 related to the asia segment.
expenses for amortization of intangible assets are recognized in administrative expenses. for the overall 
amount of amortization in the financial year, refer to section g.05.

b) breakdown of goodwill
we refer to the explanations in section b.05 for the general assumptions and methods for conducting an 
impairment test.
an impairment test was carried out in the third quarter of the 2016 financial year in order to test the goodwill 
for impairment. impairment shall be recognized if, with regard to the individual cgu, the carrying amount of 
the goodwill exceeds the recoverable amount. this recoverable amount corresponds to the higher of fair value 
less costs of disposal and its value in use. the recoverable amount of the performed impairment tests was 
based on the concept of the fair value less costs of disposal.
for the purpose of testing for impairment, goodwill was allocated to the cash-generating units of the group as 
follows as of september 30, 2016:
keur 2016 2015
yemek sepeti group 182,912 193,901
lieferheld gmbh 68,082 68,082
pizza.de gmbh 67,299 67,299
talabat group 59,716 60,415
delivery hero sweden ab 37,965 37,965
subtotal 415,974 427,662
multiple entities without significant amounts of goodwill 94,474 91,896
total 510,448 519,558
as of september 30, 2016 the recoverable amount of the cgu pizza.de gmbh was almost equal to the carrying 
amount. due to the increase of the basic interest rate, indications for an impairment existed as of december 
31, 2016. accordingly, the impairment test was carried out once more on the basis of unchanged parameters 
including the cost of capital relevant to the reporting date, which resulted in an impairment of keur 9,633.

because the business model is new, the detailed planning phase generally covers three years. the revenue 
growth assumptions used in the planning period are based on the business plan approved by the management 
as of the reference date of the impairment test. the assumptions for revenue growth used for the planning 
period following the business plan are based on internal estimates. 
the planning process for each cgu is based on a structured bottom-up approach that is carried out once a year. 
the overall process is directed by central management and the international team via top-down target-setting 
in the form of country-/company-specific kpis. the respective local management then prepares the business 
plan and adjusts it in an iterative process with central management and the international team.
the different local management teams use cohort models for revenue planning. the cohort models analyze the 
past order behavior of (local) customers and apply statistic methods to forecast the future behavior of existing 
customers. future revenue from new customers is derived from the planned marketing expenses and the 
development of estimated costs per new customer over time. the material assumptions for the cohort models 
include the customer retention/reorder rate, customer activity rate, average order size and commission rates.
the costs (excluding marketing expenses) are planned on the basis of ratios (especially in relation to the 
number of users and orders).
the first three planning periods are always planned in detail. from the 2020 financial year until 2023, revenue 
and ebitda margins are forecast on the basis of corresponding market estimates (market potential, competi-
tive environment, megatrends). 
derivation of the equity component of wacc is based on a uniform risk-free base rate of 1.00% for the eur 
area (previous year: 0.75%) and a cgu-specific risk premium of between 6.5% and 18.0% (previous year: 6.0% 
to 29.8%). the risk premium contains adjustment components for inflation and country risk as well as market 
risk and cgu-specific premiums, which depend largely on the period of occurrence and are reduced as the 
history is extended. in addition, an entity-specific risk factor (beta factor) of 1.1 is used across cgus. tax rates  
of between 15.0% and 33.3% are used dependent on the cgu. due to the assumption of full equity financing, 
the wacc contains no debt component, so the input tax rates are identical to the interest rates used.
as part of annual impairment testing as of september 30, 2016, a sensitivity analysis was also conducted. in 
each case, an increase of the base rate by 100 bps, a proportional reduction of planned annual revenue growth 
by ten percent and an absolute reduction of the planned ebitda margin by five percent were assumed for this. 
none of these adjustments led to a need for an impairment.

the increase in the carrying amount for operating and office equipment is based on an increase in purchasing 
driven by strong growth of operations as well as additions due to acquisitions. for acquisitions in the financial 
year, please refer also to section d.02. advance payments in 2015 resulted from the reconstruction of a rented 
office space to be used in the future and were reclassified in 2016. the other reclassifications relate mainly to 
non-current assets of discontinued operations.

c) capital reserves
dh’s capital reserves increased by keur 378.658 in the reporting year; this is mainly attributable to the 
following circumstances: 
an increase in capital reserves of keur 383.491 resulted from premiums paid in the course of the aforementi-
oned capital increases. the majority is attributable to the contribution of emerging markets online food 
delivery holding s.à.r.l. (see section d.02.).
in addition, there was an increase in capital reserves of keur 936 in connection with a share-based payment 
agreement (for details on the ifrs 2 program see section i.01).
a reduction in the capital reserve by keur 5.768 (2015: keur 6.611) results from transactions with companies 
with non-controlling shares in equity. this mainly relates to the first-time recognition of a dh group liability to 
a minority shareholder of a subsidiary and to the effects of adjustments of management participation programs 
at subsidiaries of the dh group (see section i.01).

separate financial statements of international subsidiaries recognized directly in equity as well as effects from 
the remeasurement of net defined benefit liabilities. as in 2015, the increase in currency differences in 2016 
resulted mainly from the depreciation of the turkish lira against the euro in the reporting year. the following

liabilities to banks have changed as follows:
keur dec. 31, 2016 dec. 31, 2015
liabilities to banks 116,403 0
total 116,403 0
the increase in liabilities to banks is attributable to the taking out of a bank loan with a nominal value of up  
to keur 120,000 in connection with the redemption of the yemek sepeti vendor loan. in the financial year, the 
loan was partially repaid by keur 1,500. the bank loan includes an interest rate floor and a termination option 
on the part of delivery hero. these constitute a separable embedded derivative and were separate from the 
base contract as a compound derivative in accordance with ias 39.ag29 when the loan was taken out. the 
interest rate floor derivative and the termination option had a market value of keur 276 as of december 31, 
2016, and are recorded under trade and other receivables.
specific bank accounts, trademark rights and receivables serve as a collateral base and shares in individual 
companies are pledged as security for the bank loan. the agreements serve solely to secure payment obliga-
tions to creditors. no voting rights materialize for the pledgee from this. see section f.14 for quantitative 
information.

13 other provisions
the decrease in other provisions in 2016 primarily results from the use of provisions for employee participation 
programs recognized in the previous year.
the restructuring provisions mainly concern obligations from existing leases resulting from the relocation of 
the premises of one dh entity. a portion of the provision was reversed in 2016. there are significant uncertain-
ties in respect of the extent and due date of outflows; restructuring of this entity is expected to be completed 
in 2017. 
as of the balance sheet date, contingent liabilities amounting to a maximum of keur 2,800 (previous year 
keur 0) consist of potential legal disputes. the company expects these potential legal disputes to be averted 
and the risk of a claim is considered to be very low. in addition, the dh group is exposed to further business 
risks, which however do not allow for any reasonable assessment to be made due to their type and very low 
probability of occurrence.

the maturity of trade payables and other liabilities is broken down, as indicated above. non-current trade 
payments and other liabilities mainly relate to other loans, liabilities from derivative financial instruments and 
vendor loans.
the decrease of the vendor loan is due to its repayment in connection with the new bank loan (see section f.11). 
the increase in other loans resulted primarily from the new loans taken out in 2016 with a nominal value 
totaling keur 55,000, which was disbursed in several tranches. the agreement stipulates that the loans are to 
be repaid in 2018. the other loans also include a loan taken out in 2015 with a nominal value of keur 90,000, 
which had a carrying amount of keur 80,486 as of december 31, 2016 (previous year: keur 74,063), and a loan 
already taken out in 2014 with a nominal value of keur 100,000 and a carrying amount of keur 91,178 as of 
december 31, 2016 (previous year: keur 84.660). the loan with a nominal value of keur 100,000 was restructu-
red twice in 2015.

both restructurings led to a disposal of the existing liability and rerecognition of the restructured loan at fair 
value. both the restructured loan and the new loan taken out are hybrid financial instruments pursuant to ias 
32.28, containing both equity and debt components. the debt component of both loans was determined in the 
course of initial recognition as present value of future interest and principal payments. subsequent measure-
ment occurs at amortized cost. the equity component is calculated using the residual value method as the 
difference between the fair value of the entire instrument and the fair value of the debt component taking into 
account all separable derivatives embedded in the loan agreement. the agreement stipulates that both loans 
are to be repaid by mid-2018.
both loan agreements include several embedded derivatives, each of which is to be treated as a compound 
derivative in accordance with ias 39.ag29 and stated at fair value. the embedded derivatives relate to stock 
interest, i.e. the supply of shares in lieu of interest payments, and special termination rights. the market value 
of the embedded derivatives from both loan agreements amounts to keur 12,797 as of december 31, 2016 
(previous year: keur 19,267) and increases the liabilities from derivative financial instruments. all embedded 
derivatives are level 3 instruments.  
in 2016, derivative financial liabilities also relate to written put and purchased call options (synthetic forward 
transactions) on non-controlling interests of acquired companies pedidosya s.a. (pedidosya group) and 
inversiones cmr s.a.s. (clickdelivery group) totaling keur 19,443 as of december 31, 2016 (previous year: 
keur 22,659). the liability from the outstanding put option on the shares of hungry.nl amounted to keur 
1,713 as of the reporting date (previous year: keur 50). in addition, for the pedidosya group there is also a 
variable purchase price component for the controlling interests in the form of own dh shares. this is also 
linked to the value at the date of the exit event and amounts to keur 2,983 as of december 31, 2016 (previous 
year: keur 3,159). all of the derivatives described are level 3 instruments.
the contingent purchase price liability from the acquisition of e-food was keur 20.963 as of the reporting date 
(previous year: keur 9.716) and is a level 3 instrument.
in connection with the acquisition of the foodpanda group, a usd currency forward was acquired with a 
carrying amount of keur 979 as of december 31, 2016. this is a level 2 derivative.
the other financial liabilities primarily comprise liabilities to restaurants. 
specific bank accounts, trademark rights, receivables and shares in individual companies are pledged as 
security. the agreements serve solely to secure payment obligations to creditors. no voting rights materialize 
for the pledgee from this. secured financial liabilities amount to keur 297.410 as of december 31, 2016 
(previous year: keur 92,868). the carrying amount of the financial assets serving as collateral amounted to 
keur 1.357.263 (previous year: keur 298,832), which mainly related to investments in subsidiaries, which are 
eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

marketing expenses are up 11% year on year and increased at a lower rate than revenue. the already low

it expenses relate partly to expenses for research and development, for instance for the development of the 
order platforms. despite strong growth, the dh group continues to be in the start-up and structuring phase of 
company organization, administration and process architecture. the close interaction between maintenance, 
adjustment to market conditions and the resulting development of the order platform does not currently 
permit the determination of research and development costs. the group is nevertheless working on a structure 
that will allow research and development costs to be quantified in future. further disclosures on research and 
development can be found in the group management report for the 2016 financial year.

total interest income and interest expenses relate to financial assets and liabilities that are not at fair value 
through profit or loss. income from the amortization of transactions costs in 2015 resulted mainly from 
non-recurring effects connected with two restructurings of a loan agreement for keur 100,000. both restructu-
rings led to derecognition in profit or loss of the existing liability and a subsequent re-recognition in profit or 
loss of the fair value of the liability.
the high expenses from the amortization of transactions costs in 2015 resulted mainly from the effects on 
earnings connected with two restructurings of a loan agreement for keur 100,000. both restructurings led to 
derecognition in profit or loss of the existing liability and a subsequent re-recognition in profit or loss of the 
fair value of the liability.
the increase in other interest expenses resulted mainly from the new interest-bearing liabilities assumed in

total -9,340 -17,869
the keur 8.528 improvement in other finance income/costs resulted mainly from the change in the gains/
losses from currency translation.
the decrease in income from the measurement of derivative financial instruments in 2016 resulted mainly from 
the subsequent measurement of the put/call options. the high income in 2015 resulted mainly from non-recur-
ring effects relating to the derecognition of the related embedded derivatives in the course of restructuring 
the base loan instruments.
the increase in expenses from the measurement of derivative financial instruments in 2015 resulted from the 
subsequent measurement of the separated embedded derivatives and the derecognition of the related 
embedded derivatives in the course of restructuring the base loan instruments. in 2016, the expenses from the 
measurement of derivative financial instruments resulted mainly from the increased fair value from purchase 
price obligations.
the impairment of investments in 2016 resulted mainly from the amortization of an associate acquired in 2015.
the equity-accounted investments in associates generated a negative profit contribution of keur  5,107 
(previous year: keur -2,602). this includes the profit contribution of the company written off in 2016 up to its 
impairment.

statement of cash flows
 
 
the consolidated statement of cash flows was prepared in accordance with ias 7 and shows the in-flow and 
outflow of cash flows during the reporting year. cash flows are broken down into cash flows from operating 
activities, cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities. the cash flows arising 
from operating activities are determined using the indirect method pursuant to ias 7.18 (b).
the cash and cash equivalents shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows correspond to cash and  
cash equivalents in the statement of financial position, namely cash on hand and at banks; please refer to 
section f.09. cash and cash equivalents accessible to the group amounted to keur 230,853 as of december 31, 
2016 (previous year: keur 160,150). some of the payment service providers used by the dh group block a 
minor percentage of the available credit for some days until the transactions are fully processed. please refer  
to section d.03.a) in respect of possible restrictions due to currency controls in china and argentina.
the negative cash flow from operating activities in 2015 and 2016 results mainly from the loss for the period 
and the increase in current assets. the increase in trade receivables and other assets reflects in particular the 
company’s growth. cash flow from investing activities in 2016 mainly comprises the acquisition presented in 
section d.01 and investments in intangible fixed assets and property, plant and equipment. the item “net 
payments for the acquisition of shares in consolidated companies” includes mainly the balance from the cash 
component of the consideration transferred and the cash and cash equivalents assumed (keur 132,444) for the 
company acquisitions. cash flow from financing activities reflects the cash increase in equity capital in 2015  
and 2016. in addition, additional loans were taken out both in 2015 and 2016. the two contributed to securing 
the dh group’s operations. 
aggregated disclosures on assets and liabilities of acquired subsidiaries, inclusive of the acquired cash and  
cash equivalents and cash components of remuneration of the acquisition, are to be found in section d.02.a). 
disclosures on deconsolidation are to be found in section d.03.b).

01 share-based payment – ifrs 2 program
the dh group has been operating a share-based payment program since 2011 so that top-level management 
participates in the development of the company and its contribution to the sustained success of the dh group 
is honored in comparison to the competition. the group of beneficiaries comprises members of management 
and the top management of delivery hero gmbh as well as management bodies and the top management of 
affiliates of the dh group.
a) dh vsp: description of the program
six programs (virtual share program i-vi) were approved by the advisory board of the company. the nominal 
value of each virtual share amounts to eur 1. shares are issued successively following approval.
entitled persons have an individual contractual claim on the company for payment of a cash equivalent to the 
shares issued. in the case of a material change in the shareholder structure (“exit”), these claims are immedia-
tely payable. an exit is deemed to exist if a sale or transfer of more than 75% of all shares in the company 
occurs. an exchange or acquisition as part of an individual transaction or a series of consecutive transactions  
as well as a sale or transfer of more than 75% of assets or a liquidation or de facto liquidation of the company 
is treated in the same way. 
in the case of an exit, all claims on virtual shares already issued are immediately due for payment at the date  
of concluding the transaction. following the exit, tendered claims are being assigned on a monthly basis. the 
number of shares issued is individually specified in contractual agreements. in addition, additional or other 
tender scenarios or criteria governing the vested nature are individually specified and defined in the individual 
contractual agreements. the company, however, proceeded to standardize these arrangements in their entirety.

the exercise prices agreed in the programs (strike prices) vary in the range presented below depending on the 
issuance date of the subscription right. shares in individual programs are distributed as follows:

no rights to the subscription of gmbh ownership interests of the company and dividends resulting from 
ownership interests or distributions from the virtual shares are granted to entitled persons. in the event of 
conversion of the gmbh into a stock corporation, the virtual shares would be converted into share options.  
the arrangement for these share options after conversion to a stock corporation, e.g. whether settlement 
occurs in shares or in cash, has not yet been made.
the vsps end on december 31, 2030. the individual agreements can be terminated by the company with effect 
from december 31, 2030. in the case of termination of agreements as of or after december 31, 2030, the 
company must provide compensation payment.
all taxes, other levies or fees, which accompany the issuance of virtual shares or cash payments as part of these 
agreements, are to be borne by the beneficiary and may be withheld by the company and deducted from 
payments as part of this agreement. excluded from this are the corresponding employer’s contributions, which 
were added into the calculation.
b) dh vsp: vesting period/non-forfeiture
to the extent that there are no other arrangements in individual agreements, the contractual vesting period 
extends over a period of 48 months. prior to the commencement of the contractual vesting period, an additio-
nal vesting period (cliff) of up to 12 months can be arranged on the part of the issuer and a period of up to  
24 months can be arranged individually by the participant between the company and the beneficiary. these 
vesting periods have an impact on non-forfeiture as they present a type of waiting period from the beginning 
of the contractual subscription period and non-forfeiture of individual claims can materialize only at a later 
date. if the work or engagement relationship, irrespective of the reason, ends during the vesting period, the 
virtual shares expire. 
employees who opt to leave the company (‘bad leaver’) have no claim to virtual shares. 
measurement of share-based payment of employees is made using an option pricing model (black-scholes 
model) based on the valuation of a call option on the company’s shares. the volatilities used for this are 
derived by applying a standard peer group and amount to 40%.

the exit was assumed for the maturity of the options, namely september 30, 2017. market prices were deter- 
mined using a company valuation. the exercise price corresponds to the aforementioned strike prices. the 
underlying risk-free interest rate is 0.0%. to derive the underlying company valuation, a dcf-based company 
valuation was conducted based on the business plan and the statement of financial position as of the reporting 
date; the parameters for discounting the recovery of capital correspond to the specifications given for impair-
ment testing (refer to section c.01.b)). assumptions regarding the key performance indicators of the business 
plan, such as the underlying ebitda margin, were also applied. the measurement using these parameters is 
shown below. changes in the measurement of liabilities arising from share-based payment were recognized 
through profit or loss in the respective period.

in 2016 financial year a new option program for the foodora-group was established. the nominal value of each 
virtual share amounts to eur 1. shares are issued successively following management approval. these are 
virtual shares in the operating companies of the foodora group (foodora opco).
entitled persons have an individual contractual claim on the parent company of the foodora opco companies 
(holdco) for payment of a cash equivalent to the shares issued. in the case of a material change in the sharehol-
der structure (“exit”) of the foodora group or the dh group, these claims are immediately payable. an exit is 
deemed to exist if a sale or transfer of more than 75% of all shares in the company or an ipo of the company 
occurs. an exchange or acquisition as part of an individual transaction or a series of consecutive transactions as 
well as a sale or transfer of more than 75% of assets or a liquidation or de facto liquidation of the company is 
treated in the same way.
following the exit, tendered claims are being assigned on a monthly basis. the number of shares issued is 
individually specified in contractual agreements. in addition, additional or other tender scenarios or criteria 
governing the vested nature are individually specified and defined in the individual contractual agreements. 
the company, however, proceeded to standardize these arrangements in their entirety. 
the exercise prices agreed in the program (strike prices) vary between eur 0 and eur 723. 1,446 shares are 
available under this program.
no rights to the subscription of ownership interests of the company and dividends resulting from ownership 
interests or distributions from the virtual shares are granted to entitled persons. 
the vsps end on december 31, 2030. the individual agreements can be terminated by the company with effect 
from december 31, 2030. in the case of termination of agreements as of or after december 31, 2030, the 
company must provide compensation payment.
all taxes, other levies or fees, which accompany the issuance of virtual shares or cash payments as part of these 
agreements, are to be borne by the beneficiary and may be withheld by the company and deducted from 
payments as part of this agreement. excluded from this are the corresponding employer’s contributions, which 
were added into the calculation.

to the extent that there are no other arrangements in individual agreements, the contractual vesting period 
extends over a period of 48 months. prior to the commencement of the contractual vesting period, an additio-
nal vesting period (cliff) of up to 12 months can be arranged on the part of the issuer and a period of up to

of the contractual subscription period and non-forfeiture of individual claims can materialize only at a later 
date. if the work or engagement relationship, irrespective of the reason, ends during the vesting period, the 
virtual shares expire. 
employees who opt to leave the company (‘bad leaver’) have no claim to virtual shares. 
due to the mutual dependency and the uncertainty as to future variables, the financial and operational 
benchmarks were derived from a multi-level, integrated monte carlo simulation. on the basis of resulting 
values, it was determined when the combined option is valuable and thus when it should be exercised. 
the measurement is based on publicly available, observable market data and on unobservable input parame-
ters. the unobservable input parameters include mainly future financial and operational key performance 
indicators. these are simulated using a monte carlo approach with the model being calibrated based on 
development in line with existing budget plans for the relevant companies. other financial key performance 
indicators were taken from the existing financial statements of the related companies and extrapolated in  
line with the simulation results.

g) e-food: description of share option program
on may 2, 2015, ecommerce business 10 s.à r.l. granted the senior executives of ofd online delivery services 
ltd (ofd) (“beneficiaries” or “option holders”) a share option for a portion of the shares in ofd. in connection 
with this, a put and call agreement was concluded between ecommerce business 10 s.à r.l. and the senior 
executives. the exercise of the put and call option agreed therein is dependent on the exercise of the share 
option and on the rendering of work performance by the senior executives. following each exercise of the 
share option, the option holder has the right to sell the shares in ofd acquired via the share option. this right 
is granted to the option holder for 30 days following exercise of the share option. the sale price of a share 
corresponds to the market value of all shares in the company at the respective vesting period of the share, 
multiplied by a performance factor and divided by the number of shares in the company. the option program 
allows senior executives to share in the performance of ofd. as the share option and the put and call agree-
ment are mutually dependent, the option program, in economic terms, is considered a commitment that is 
accounted for as a share-based ifrs 2 program.
the commitment includes the option between the issuance of shares of a listed group company and the cash 
payment or issuance of shares of an unlisted company within the dh group. as no past dh group operational 
practice or declared guidelines exist on this issue and no legal obligation to make cash payment is present,  
this commitment is to be recognized as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction. 
the integrated option consists of two individual agreements. in the course of the first option, the founders 
have the right to buy shares in the greek company (ofd). the purchase price itself and the value of the shares 
itself is unclear as of the reporting date. in the case that the option is advantageous and is thus exercised,  
the founders again have the immediate right to tender the shares to dh. in this case, the founders surrender 
their acquired shares and in return receive payment, which via various contractual parameters is linked to key 
financial and operational performance indicators of ofd over the next few years. 
with respect to the economic dependency of the two transactions, the options were considered as one 
interdependent transaction, this means it is decisive for the exercise of the option whether the payment 
amount to the founders for the acquired shares in the (contingent) second option is larger than the purchase 
price to be paid by the founders for the shares in the first option. 
with regard to the two underlying shares of the agreements, two tranches are set out in terms of the vesting 
period, the number of shares granted and the future measurement dates. this is also taken into account in the 
measurement.
due to the mutual dependency and the uncertainty as to future variables, the financial and operational 
benchmarks were derived from a multi-level, integrated monte carlo simulation. on the basis of resulting 
values, it was determined when the combined option is valuable and thus when it should be exercised. 
the measurement is based on publicly available, observable market data and on unobservable input parame-
ters. the unobservable input parameters include mainly future financial and operational key performance 
indicators. these are simulated using a monte carlo approach with the model being calibrated based on 
development in line with existing budget plans for the relevant companies. other financial key performance 
indicators were taken from the existing financial statements of the related companies and extrapolated in  
line with the simulation results.

measurement takes place just once at the conclusion of the agreement. a measurement is only repeated if  
the contractual parameters are modified. then the measurement takes place with due regard to the modified 
parameters – otherwise applying the same assumptions and conditions.
for the commitment as agreed in the previous year, an expense of keur 1,351 was recorded under administrative 
expenses this year.
the vesting period for tranche 1 is up to december 31, 2018, and for tranche 2 up to december 31, 2019. the 
vested purchase rights can be exercised between december 31, 2019, and march 31, 2020, and expire after  
this time period. as of the reporting date december 31, 2016, the average contractual life of the options was 
2.5 years.
the number of options and the weighted average exercise price developed in 2016 as follows:

in addition to the programs described above, there are another three programs drafted in 2015, which for 
reasons of materiality are summarized below.  the aim of these programs is to allow for management of 
certain subsidiaries to share in the performance of the companies run by them. the programs are cash-settled; 
in the case of an exit, all claims on virtual shares already issued are immediately due for payment at the date  
of concluding the transaction. following the exit, tendered claims are being assigned on a monthly basis. the 
number of shares issued is individually specified in contractual agreements. in addition, additional or other 
tender scenarios or criteria governing the vested nature are individually specified and defined in the individual 
contractual agreements. during the programs the exercise price of rgp korea is between eur 1–2,000 per 
share, the other two programs hold no exercise price.
measurement of share-based payment of employees is made using an option pricing model (black-scholes 
model) in line with the approach in measuring the virtual share program.

all derivative financial instruments are classified in the fair value hierarchy as level 3 as the measurement is 
carried out on the basis of non-observable input factors.
the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, granted loans, deposits received, trade 
and other payables have predominantly short terms and are approximately in line with the fair value as of the 
reporting date.
the remaining available-for-sale financial assets (afs) shown in the statement of financial position refer to other 
investments and securities; these are recognized at cost as quoted prices on an active market are not available 
and the fair value cannot be reliably determined. there are currently no significant sale intentions. 
dh loans liabilities are recognized at amortized cost. thus the carrying amount does not correspond to the fair 
value. the fair value of loan liabilities is determined as the present value of future cash flows taking account of 
riskless interest rates valid as of the reporting date and a specific risk premium for dh.
net result by measurement category:
in accordance with ifrs 7.20 (a), net gains and losses of financial instruments are to be disclosed for each 
measurement category of ias 39.
the net results of individual measurement categories pursuant to ias 39 are as follows:
net income (loss) by measurement category (in keur) 2016 2015
lar -411 -5,391
afs 0 -5,533

flhft 5,147 -6,914
flac -24,479 -28,527
total -19,109 -40,423
the net result of the lar measurement category contains impairment losses and reversals on trade receivables. 
the net result of the lar measurement category also includes interest income. the net result of the fahft and 
flhft measurement categories includes results from the measurement of these derivatives at market prices. 
the net result of the flac measurement category includes interest expenses for ongoing debt service as well  
as the result from loan amortization, which is also included in interest expense.

no reconciliation between the different levels of the fair value hierarchy took place during the financial year.
realized gains and losses from the change in level 3 instruments are recognized in finance income/expense. 
unrealized gains or losses are recognized in revenue reserves and other reserves.
the fair value of the separable embedded derivatives is determined using an option pricing model at each 
relevant reporting date. in the course of the measurement process, the required publicly-available market data 
is collected and unobservable input parameters are updated using internal calculations. the latter relates in 
particular to the value determined for each company share of dh and the specific risk premium for dh. both 
parameters were updated on each measurement date. the calculation of the sensitivities for unobservable 
input parameters is presented in the section “market risks.”

the future payment obligation for non-controlling shares for pedidosya and clickdelivery is linked via different 
contractual parameters to the enterprise value of dh at the date of the exit event. owing to this interdependen-
ce, the fair value of put/call options is determined using monte carlo simulations. measurement is made at 
each relevant reporting date. in the course of the measurement process, the required publicly available market 
data is collected and unobservable input parameters are updated at the respective reporting date using internal 
calculations. the latter relates in particular to the value determined for each company share of dh using a dis- 
counted cash flow approach, which represents the key influencing factor for the measurement result. volatility 
is derived from the historical volatility of peer group companies as of the reporting date.
in line with the presentation above, the calculation of the fair value of the variable purchase price component 
of pedidosya group valued in own dh shares is based on the value of each dh company share as determined 
using the discounted cash flow approach. the option value is calculated using the black-scholes model. the 
significant unobservable input parameters of the model to calculate the value of dh shares are found in section 
f.01.b). the estimated fair value of options would rise (decline) if the dh share price was to rise (fall).
the put/call options at baedaltong co., ltd. are based on a contractually determined subsequent settlement of 
deferred consideration and were settled in advance in 2015.
the contingent payment obligation for the earn-out provision at ofd is linked via various contractual parame-
ters to key financial and operational performance indicators of ofd over the next few years. due to the mutual 
dependency and the uncertainty as to future variables, the financial and operational benchmarks are derived 
from a monte carlo simulation. based on the results of the simulation, the value of a potential earn-out 
payment at the respective future dates is determined based on contractual agreements. the measurement is 
based on publicly available, observable market data and on unobservable input parameters. the unobservable 
input parameters include mainly future financial and operational key performance indicators. these are 
simulated using a monte carlo approach with the model being calibrated based on development in line with 
existing budget plans for the relevant companies. other financial key performance indicators were taken from 
the existing financial statements of the related companies and extrapolated in line with the simulation results. 
measurement is made at each relevant reporting date and the parameters updated accordingly. this relates to 
both the publicly available market data and unobservable input parameters, e.g. the ofd’s budget planning.
the methods described above were also used for the valuation of further put/call-option agreements for the 
purchase of further shares in foodarena gmbh, biel, switzerland and hungry netherlands b.v., netherlands.

b) risk management
the dh group considers itself exposed to default risks, liquidity risks and market risks, especially interest  
rate and foreign exchange risks, through the use of financial instruments. dh actively monitors these risks  
and manages them using a risk management system. the risk management function is integrated in group 
controlling.  
c) credit risk
the credit or default risk is the risk that the business partners, mainly restaurants, are unable to fulfill their 
payment obligations, which would mean the dh group incurs a loss. as in the previous year, such risks mainly 
involve current trade receivables. the dh group does not regard itself as being exposed to a major default  
risk from any single individual customer. the concentration of the credit-worthiness risk is limited due to the 
broad and heterogeneous customer base. the dh group monitors the default risk and, as in the previous year, 
manages it actively by making any necessary credit checks and by optimizing the payment process. conse- 
quently, the risk is largely transferred to the restaurants (also by way of an effective debt collection system).
the maximum default risk corresponds to the carrying amount of the financial assets.
in addition, the following table presents the maturity structure of the financial assets that are not impaired,  
not past due as well as those due as of the reporting date. in respect of receivables that are neither impaired 
nor past due, there was no indication on the reporting date that the debtors would not meet their payment 
obligations.

d) liquidity risk  
owing to strong growth, the dh group has to rely on external financing to ensure sufficient liquidity, as in the 
previous year. a lack of external financing could threaten the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
through proper budget planning, the dh group’s liquidity management makes sure that sufficient funds are 
available. furthermore, a constantly secured and adequate amount of cash and cash equivalents ensures that 
operations can be financed. unused credit lines are also available. as stated in section i.03, the group has a 
loan that includes specific financial and non-financial covenants. a future breach of the covenants could lead to 
the loan being repayable earlier than specified in the table below.
the following table presents contractual (undiscounted) interest and principal payments for the dh group’s 
genuine financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments with negative fair value. derivative financial 
liabilities are only taken into account in the analysis if the contractual due date is required for comprehension 
of the timing of cash flows. the maturity is based on the contractually determined interest obligations of 
financial liabilities.

e) market risk  
the dh group generates a significant portion of its revenue in foreign currencies through its international 
subsidiaries. as in the previous year, the dh group generally tried to generate income and incur expenses in 
the same functional currency in order to reduce foreign exchange risk. nevertheless, each group entity of the 
dh group is exposed to currency risk as soon as transactions are concluded and the resulting payment flows  
do not correspond to the functional currency of the respective entity. the following table shows the effects on 
the statement of comprehensive income that would result if the presented foreign currencies had appreciated 
or depreciated by 10% as of the reporting date.

eur-pln 1,153 -1,269 926 -1,018
a uruguayan subsidiary of the dh group has liabilities in usd, harboring a foreign exchange rate risk between 
the uyu and usd, which would affect the net income (loss) for the period.
in addition, the dh group considers itself exposed to foreign exchange risk through its investment in internati-
onal subsidiaries when translating net assets. however, this is not a foreign exchange risk as defined by ifrs 7. 
some of the loans drawn by the group have floating interest rates on the basis of reference interest rates. 
changes in market interest rates may increase the interest payable in the future, which would negatively affect 
the company’s financial performance. a 1% higher (lower) market interest rate would have led to an effect on 
profit or loss of keur 808 (keur 0).

based on derivatives held or issued by the dh group as of the reporting date, a hypothetical change (quantified 
using sensitivity analysis) for the share values relevant to the respective instruments would have the following 
listed effects (before tax) as of the reporting date:
financial instruments as of effect on profit  effect on profit 
december 31, 2016 or loss  or loss 
keur +10% -10%
separable embedded derivatives -693 861
variable purchase price component 
-298 298
pedidosya
derivatives from put/call options -3.608 3.869
 
with respect to the determined value of the separable embedded derivatives (similar to the derivatives arising 
from put/call options and the variable purchase price component), the value per dh company share deter-
mined using the discounted cash flow method is a parameter having a material impact on the measurement 
result. as of december 31, 2015, the sensitivity analysis is as follows:
financial instruments as of effect on profit  effect on pro-
december 31, 2015 or loss  fit or loss 
keur +10% -10%
separable embedded derivatives -1.309 1.429
variable purchase price component 
-316 316
pedidosya
derivatives from put/call options -3.256 3.163
in addition to dh’s share value and relative to the separable embedded derivatives, dh’s risk premium is 
another unobservable input factor. a 1% higher or lower risk premium would have led to an effect on profit or 
loss of keur -866 or keur 1,155 (previous year: keur +2,051 or keur -1,851).
the expected future revenue is a key unobservable input factor in the measurement of the contingent purchase 
price obligations from company acquisitions. 5% higher or lower revenue would have led to an effect on profit 
or loss of keur -1,245 or keur 1,260 (previous year: keur -2,678 or keur +2,634). the estimated fair value of 
the obligation would rise (decline) if the expected revenue were to rise (fall).
the expected future gross merchandise value (gmv) is a key unobservable input factor in the measurement of 
the contingent purchase price obligations from company acquisitions. 5% higher or lower gmv would have led 
to an effect on profit or loss of keur 99 or keur -92 (previous year: keur  -2,678 or keur +2,634). the estima-
ted fair value of the obligation would rise (decline) if the expected revenue were to rise (fall).
